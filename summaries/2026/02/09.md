## 13:37:12
The `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` file, updated on `09/02/2026, 11:44:42`, received a substantial update. This Svelte component is responsible for displaying the order summary, incorporating complex logic for calculating the total price based on various discounts (coupon, prepaid, loyalty, store credit, MRP), shipping, COD charges, GST, TwidPay rewards, Gyftr, and convenience fees. It handles cart item processing, including the separation of blocked and available items, and detailed management of free products and automatic discounts within the cart. The component also integrates event logging for analytics (GTM, GA4) when the order summary drawer is toggled.

The `EnvironmentService.ts` files, updated at `09/02/2026, 13:09:53` and `09/02/2026, 13:10:27`, have been excluded from the summary as they define environment-specific URLs and access tokens, which fall under the category of sensitive information.

The `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file, updated on `09/02/2026, 13:11:00`, serves as a test merchant page. It embeds a custom `gokwikSdk` for initializing and interacting with the Gokwik SDK, including handling payment processing and custom events. It also implements client-side cookie management to track `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`. A `merchantInfo` object with local environment settings and various IDs is hardcoded for testing purposes.

The `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentOptions.service.ts` file underwent updates at `09/02/2026, 13:11:32`, `13:34:09`, and `13:35:46`. This service is a central hub for managing payment options, acting as an orchestrator for numerous Svelte stores related to common application state, order details, and login information. It initializes a vast array of variables by subscribing to these stores, handling conditional logic for COD confirmation, prepaid freebies, user agent compatibility, and payment text customization. While there were multiple timestamps, no functional changes were apparent in the provided snippets for the later updates compared to the initial one, suggesting minor saves or formatting changes.

The `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentButtons/PSPOrderButtons.svelte` component, updated on `09/02/2026, 13:14:02`, focuses on displaying and managing Payment Service Provider (PSP) buttons, specifically for UPI and BNPL methods. It incorporates complex logic for dynamic button visibility based on experimental variants (e.g., `UPI_CONFIG_EXPERIMENT`, `instagramUpiFallbackConfigs`), device type, and app detection. The component also includes features like Cash to Prepaid (C2P) timers and logic for handling UPI collect flows and redirection failures.

The `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/Accordion/AccordionPaymentOptions.svelte` file saw several updates:
*   On `09/02/2026, 13:14:55`, the initial version of the accordion UI for payment options was introduced. This includes functionality for handling prepaid freebie prompts, reward-based payment methods, and auto-selection of payment methods based on screen size and user preferences.
*   A minor debugging change was committed on `09/02/2026, 13:20:08`, adding a `console.log` statement within the `startPaymentAction` function.
*   A functional change occurred on `09/02/2026, 13:36:39`, with the addition of `store_gkBnpl` to imports and the inclusion of `store_isGokwikBnpl.set(false)` within the `onHeaderClick` function, indicating specific state management for Gokwik BNPL methods.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Svelte Stores:** A prominent pattern across almost all files is the extensive use of Svelte stores (`CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`) for reactive state management. Components and services heavily subscribe to and update these stores, creating a highly reactive and interconnected application state.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** Several files, especially `EnvironmentService.ts` (though not summarized) and `PSPOrderButtons.svelte`, contain logic that varies based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`). This is crucial for configuring API endpoints, tokens, and feature availability.
*   **Payment-Related Features:** The changes largely revolve around enhancing the payment experience. This includes detailed order summary calculations, diverse payment method handling (UPI, BNPL, cards, EMI), offer management (cashback, freebies, rewards), and UI components like accordions and PSP buttons.
*   **Event Logging & Analytics:** `OrderSummary.svelte` and `PSPOrderButtons.svelte` demonstrate a consistent pattern of logging user interactions and events (`fireGtmEvent`, `fireAnalyticsGa4`, `logEvent`) for analytical purposes, indicating a focus on tracking user behavior throughout the checkout flow.
*   **Conditional UI/Logic:** Many components exhibit conditional rendering and logic based on various flags, user data, and experimental settings (e.g., `shouldShowOnplScreen`, `isNewPSPPanelEnabled`, `shouldUseWebviewFallbackFlowV2`, `instagramExperiment`). This allows for dynamic adaptation of the user interface and payment flows.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (Timestamp: 09/02/2026, 13:11:00)**
    This HTML file demonstrates how the Gokwik SDK is integrated into a merchant's page. It defines a `gokwikSdk` JavaScript object responsible for initializing the SDK (`gokwik.js`), processing payments, emitting/listening to events, and hiding Gokwik buttons. The page uses `window.postMessage` for communication between the merchant page and the SDK. It also sets `window.merchantInfo` with critical configuration details like `mid`, `environment` (set to 'local' for testing), `storeId`, and pixel IDs (fbpixel, snapchatPixels). Cookie functions `getCookieGk` and `setCookieGk` are used to track landing page and original referrer. A "Privy widget" marketing banner is also present.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentOptions.service.ts` (First update: 09/02/2026, 13:11:32. Last observed change: 09/02/2026, 13:35:46)**
    This TypeScript service is a central hub for managing payment options. It initializes and subscribes to a vast array of Svelte stores to dynamically configure payment methods, offers, and UI behavior.

    *   **09/02/2026, 13:36:39**: Added `store_gkBnpl` to imports and explicitly set `store_isGokwikBnpl.set(false)` at the beginning of `onHeaderClick`, indicating a more explicit reset of the Gokwik BNPL state when a different payment method is chosen.
    *   **09/02/2026, 13:37:55**: Reverted the `store_gkBnpl` import (removing it) and removed the `console.log` statement, but kept the `store_isGokwikBnpl.set(false)` reset logic. This suggests a refinement in how the BNPL state is managed without needing the `gkBnpl` store directly in this file.
    *   **09/02/2026, 13:38:29**: No functional changes from the previous version.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Svelte Store Reliance:** All `.svelte` and `.service.ts` files heavily rely on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing global application state, reflecting a highly reactive and centralized state management pattern.
*   **Environment-Specific Logic:** The `merchant.html` directly sets `window.merchantInfo.environment` to 'local', and while the `EnvironmentService.ts` files were skipped as per instructions, their filenames clearly indicate a pattern of adapting behavior based on the deployment environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production).
*   **Payment Flow Complexity:** There is significant complexity in handling various payment methods, discounts, freebies, and charges, indicating a robust e-commerce checkout system.
*   **Analytics and Event Logging:** `logEvent`, `fireGtmEvent`, and `fireAnalyticsGa4` are consistently used to track user interactions and payment events, emphasizing data-driven insights.
*   **UI/UX Adaptability:** Logic to adjust UI elements (e.g., PSP apps visibility, mobile/desktop device types, accordion vs. panel layouts) based on screen width, detected apps, and feature flags is prevalent.
*   **Bottom Sheet/Pop-up Interactions:** Components frequently interact with `store_bottomSheetState` and `store_fullScreenPopUp` for user prompts and confirmations (e.g., freebie prompt, payment method not allowed).
*   **Future Dating:** All timestamps are in February 2026, suggesting these are planned or simulated future changes, or a non-standard timestamping system.

# Activity Summary for 05/02/2025

## 16:38:53
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`  between 15:40 and 16:37 on May 2nd, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for editing order details, specifically line items and discounts.

The core functionality remains consistent throughout the revisions:  managing a table of line items, allowing quantity adjustments (with a delete option triggering a modal), applying discounts (with validation), and managing recently deleted items.  The code uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and `react-redux` for state management.

Changes across the revisions primarily involve additions and minor modifications to the `discount` state object.  Initially, the `discount` object included fields for managing discounts such as `recentlyDeletedItems`, `isModalVisible`, `discountType`, `discountValue`, etc. Later revisions added a `shippingPrice` state object with `amount` and `title` fields at approximately 16:22. This suggests an enhancement to include shipping price management in the order editing functionality.  There are no substantial structural changes to the component's logic or UI elements.  The timestamps indicate a period of focused development and refinement, with several updates occurring within short time intervals.  The overall pattern indicates iterative development, adding features and refining the discount management section of the component.

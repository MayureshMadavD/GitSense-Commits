# Activity Summary for 05/02/2025

## 16:38:53
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`  between 15:40 and 16:37 on May 2nd, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for editing order details, specifically line items and discounts.

The core functionality remains consistent throughout the revisions:  managing a table of line items, allowing quantity adjustments (with a delete option triggering a modal), applying discounts (with validation), and managing recently deleted items.  The code uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and `react-redux` for state management.

Changes across the revisions primarily involve additions and minor modifications to the `discount` state object.  Initially, the `discount` object included fields for managing discounts such as `recentlyDeletedItems`, `isModalVisible`, `discountType`, `discountValue`, etc. Later revisions added a `shippingPrice` state object with `amount` and `title` fields at approximately 16:22. This suggests an enhancement to include shipping price management in the order editing functionality.  There are no substantial structural changes to the component's logic or UI elements.  The timestamps indicate a period of focused development and refinement, with several updates occurring within short time intervals.  The overall pattern indicates iterative development, adding features and refining the discount management section of the component.

The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file between 16:41 and 18:35 on May 2nd, 2025.  The core functionality appears to be an order editing component, managing line items, discounts, and potentially shipping information.

The most significant changes revolve around the `discount` state variable.  Initially, this state contained various properties related to discounts including `recentlyDeletedItems`, `discountType`, `discountValue`, `discountTitle`, and `discountApplied`. Throughout the revisions, the logic for applying and managing discounts was refined.  There were several commits where parts of the `shouldHideUI` function were added incrementally.  The final version includes detailed logic to control the UI based on discount application, the presence of line items, and whether quantity was modified.

Between 16:43:03 and 16:45:37, the `shippingPrice` state variable was commented out, suggesting a potential change in the approach to handling shipping costs. It was then uncommented in later commits.

The component heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and `@gokwik/utilities` for API calls and helper functions.  The code consistently updates the `discount` state using an `updateState` function, improving code readability and maintainability.  The data handling shows a consistent pattern of mapping `lineItems` and `recentlyDeletedItems` into a format suitable for rendering within a Table component, utilizing `ColumnProps` for table column configuration.  The `calculateGrandTotal` function shows consistent logic for recalculating the total after discount application.

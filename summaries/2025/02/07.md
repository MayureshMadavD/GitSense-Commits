The provided code represents multiple revisions of a Svelte component (`Discounts.svelte`) responsible for managing discounts within a checkout UI.  The component heavily utilizes numerous Svelte stores for managing application state, including cart information, user details, discount codes, and various flags controlling UI elements.

The main focus of the changes revolves around handling and displaying discounts, particularly concerning the interaction of different discount types (e.g., one-click coupons, store credits, partner acquisition offers, and stacked discounts).  The code manages the application and removal of these discounts, along with relevant UI updates and error handling.

Significant changes occurred between the first and last commits. The initial versions primarily handled basic discount application and removal, displaying available offers, and interacting with Svelte stores to update the UI.

Later commits introduced:

* **Dynamic Discount Configuration:** The addition of `dynamicAutomaticExtraDiscountList` and `dynamicAutomaticOverwriteDiscountList` arrays in the final version suggests the introduction of more dynamic discount handling based on runtime configuration received via `store_requestIdObject`. This allows for server-side control over which discounts are applied automatically.

* **One-Click Coupon Enhancements:**  The handling of one-click coupons was improved, with added logic for different coupon types (`exact_discount`, `min_discount`, `max_discount`) and auto-application based on configuration.

* **Improved Stacked Discount Handling:**  The management of stacked discounts is refined through the `stackedDiscountConfig` store, influencing `allowDiscountApplication` based on the number of stacked discounts and other conditions.

* **Loyalty Program Integration:** The introduction of `isLoyaltySectionVisible` and interactions with `loyaltyApp` suggests the addition of a loyalty program integration, impacting discount application rules.


Throughout all revisions, the core functionality remained consistent: fetching and displaying available offers, applying and removing discount codes, handling store credits and other promotional offers, and updating the UI based on store changes.  The timestamps indicate a period of active development and refinement within a few hours on June 2nd and July 2nd, 2025.

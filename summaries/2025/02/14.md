# Activity Summary for 14/02/2025

## 12:58:59
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/UpiCollect/StatusPopup.svelte` was updated on 14/02/2025 at 12:40:24.  The update modifies a UI component displaying the status of a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) collection payment.  The code handles different payment statuses (PENDING, FAILED, CANCELLED), displaying appropriate messages and UI elements for each.  Key features include:

* **Dynamic UI based on payment status:**  The component renders different content depending on whether the payment is pending, failed, or cancelled.  It shows payment amount, steps to complete payment (if pending), error messages (if failed), and a timer for pending payments.

* **Timer functionality:** A timer (`CashToPrepaidTimer`) is used to track the expiry time of a pending UPI payment.  Upon expiry or cancellation, the component updates its status and logs an event.

* **Payment method selection:**  The component determines the selected payment method (PPCoD, Gokwik BNPL, or UPI) based on data from the `store_paymentMethods` store.

* **Event Logging:**  The component logs events related to UPI payment expiry and cancellation using the `logEvent` function.

* **Handling of UPI IDs:**  The component extracts the handle name from the UPI ID for display purposes, utilizing a lookup table (`MOST_USED_HANDLES`).


The code extensively uses Svelte's reactive declarations (`let`), stores (`store_...`), and custom functions for formatting, logging, and UI updates.  The styling is done using SCSS, indicating a focus on visual presentation.  Error handling is implemented to manage potential issues such as invalid time strings or missing payment methods.

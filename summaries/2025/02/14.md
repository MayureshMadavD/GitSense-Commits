# Activity Summary for 14/02/2025

## 12:58:59
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/UpiCollect/StatusPopup.svelte` was updated on 14/02/2025 at 12:40:24.  The update modifies a UI component displaying the status of a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) collection payment.  The code handles different payment statuses (PENDING, FAILED, CANCELLED), displaying appropriate messages and UI elements for each.  Key features include:

* **Dynamic UI based on payment status:**  The component renders different content depending on whether the payment is pending, failed, or cancelled.  It shows payment amount, steps to complete payment (if pending), error messages (if failed), and a timer for pending payments.

* **Timer functionality:** A timer (`CashToPrepaidTimer`) is used to track the expiry time of a pending UPI payment.  Upon expiry or cancellation, the component updates its status and logs an event.

* **Payment method selection:**  The component determines the selected payment method (PPCoD, Gokwik BNPL, or UPI) based on data from the `store_paymentMethods` store.

* **Event Logging:**  The component logs events related to UPI payment expiry and cancellation using the `logEvent` function.

* **Handling of UPI IDs:**  The component extracts the handle name from the UPI ID for display purposes, utilizing a lookup table (`MOST_USED_HANDLES`).


The code extensively uses Svelte's reactive declarations (`let`), stores (`store_...`), and custom functions for formatting, logging, and UI updates.  The styling is done using SCSS, indicating a focus on visual presentation.  Error handling is implemented to manage potential issues such as invalid time strings or missing payment methods.

The provided log shows three consecutive updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`, a React component for editing orders.  All three updates occur within a short timeframe (14/02/2025, between 13:23:49 and 13:26:34).  The code itself is a complex React component dealing with order line items, discounts, and UI elements like tables and modals. There are no apparent changes in the code between these three commits.  The component heavily uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and manages state for line items (`lineItems`), discounts (`discount`), and other UI elements.  The `discount` state object is particularly complex, tracking various aspects of discounts, including applied discounts, recently deleted items, and discount types.  The component includes functions for adding, removing, and modifying line items, as well as applying and managing discounts.  The core functionality appears unchanged across the three commits, suggesting minor, possibly inconsequential, edits or possibly just a series of failed attempts at a single commit.

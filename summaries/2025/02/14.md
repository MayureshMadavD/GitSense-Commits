# Activity Summary for 14/02/2025

## 12:58:59
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/UpiCollect/StatusPopup.svelte` was updated on 14/02/2025 at 12:40:24.  The update modifies a UI component displaying the status of a UPI (Unified Payments Interface) collection payment.  The code handles different payment statuses (PENDING, FAILED, CANCELLED), displaying appropriate messages and UI elements for each.  Key features include:

* **Dynamic UI based on payment status:**  The component renders different content depending on whether the payment is pending, failed, or cancelled.  It shows payment amount, steps to complete payment (if pending), error messages (if failed), and a timer for pending payments.

* **Timer functionality:** A timer (`CashToPrepaidTimer`) is used to track the expiry time of a pending UPI payment.  Upon expiry or cancellation, the component updates its status and logs an event.

* **Payment method selection:**  The component determines the selected payment method (PPCoD, Gokwik BNPL, or UPI) based on data from the `store_paymentMethods` store.

* **Event Logging:**  The component logs events related to UPI payment expiry and cancellation using the `logEvent` function.

* **Handling of UPI IDs:**  The component extracts the handle name from the UPI ID for display purposes, utilizing a lookup table (`MOST_USED_HANDLES`).


The code extensively uses Svelte's reactive declarations (`let`), stores (`store_...`), and custom functions for formatting, logging, and UI updates.  The styling is done using SCSS, indicating a focus on visual presentation.  Error handling is implemented to manage potential issues such as invalid time strings or missing payment methods.


## 13:58:59
The provided log shows three consecutive updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`, a React component for editing orders.  All three updates occur within a short timeframe (14/02/2025, between 13:23:49 and 13:26:34).  The code itself is a complex React component dealing with order line items, discounts, and UI elements like tables and modals. There are no apparent changes in the code between these three commits.  The component heavily uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and manages state for line items (`lineItems`), discounts (`discount`), and other UI elements.  The `discount` state object is particularly complex, tracking various aspects of discounts, including applied discounts, recently deleted items, and discount types.  The component includes functions for adding, removing, and modifying line items, as well as applying and managing discounts.  The core functionality appears unchanged across the three commits, suggesting minor, possibly inconsequential, edits or possibly just a series of failed attempts at a single commit.


## 15:59:00
The provided code log shows three consecutive updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` at 15:17:13, 15:18:14, and 15:19:44 on February 14, 2025.  The changes across all three timestamps are minimal and do not affect the overall functionality. The code itself appears to be a React component for editing order details, heavily utilizing the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library.

The component manages order line items, including adding, removing, and modifying quantities.  It also incorporates discount functionality with options for fixed amounts or percentages, and a mechanism for managing recently deleted items.  The component uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`, `useForm`) to manage state and interact with Redux store.  There is significant logic to handle discount application and calculation, including conditional rendering based on the discount's state.  The code also shows error handling for missing discount fields.  No substantive changes are observed between the three revisions.  The minute-by-minute timestamps suggest iterative development or debugging rather than major feature additions.


## 18:59:13
The log shows multiple Svelte component updates related to checkout UI functionalities, primarily focused on payment options and discount application.  Significant changes occurred between 15:10:28 and 16:06:29 on February 14, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/ConfirmPopup.svelte` (15:10:28): This component manages a confirmation popup displayed during checkout. It handles various scenarios, including discount application (messageType 1), free gift offers (messageType 2), custom messages (messageType 3), prepaid freebie removal (messageType 5), and card deletion (messageType 6).  The popup dynamically adjusts its message based on the current checkout page (`currentPage`),  calculates savings (`savings`), and logs user interactions using `logEvent`.  It interacts with several stores (`store_confirmClose`, `store_prepaidFreebie`, `store_selectedCard`, etc.) to manage state.  The component also incorporates exit flow feedback, allowing users to provide reasons for abandoning the checkout process.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/WalletCredits.svelte` (15:11:34 - 15:11:55): This component displays and manages wallet credits (loyalty points) during checkout.  Multiple updates were made within a short time span, suggesting iterative improvements or bug fixes. The UI adapts based on the current checkout page (`page`), showing options to redeem or remove credits. It handles interactions with  `store_giftCardRewards`, `store_requestIdObject`,  and others, to manage the application and removal of credits.  The code handles cases where discounts are incompatible with credits, using a modal (`RemoveDiscountPopUp`) to communicate this to the user.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/CardPayments/LatestSavedCard.svelte` (15:13:30): This component shows the user's latest saved card.  It handles payment initiation, checking for prepaid freebie conflicts (`store_prepaidFreebie`), and CVV input if required. The component uses `logEvent` for tracking and interacts with stores related to saved cards (`store_selectedCard`, `store_selectedCardCvv`), payment methods (`store_selectedPaymentOptionButton`), and bottom sheets (`store_bottomSheetState`).


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/AvailableOffers.svelte` (15:13:59 - 15:37:55): This component displays available and unavailable discount offers.  A significant update at 15:37:55 likely involved improvements in handling offer details and display. It manages user input for manual coupon application, automatically applying offers (`applyCouponPaymentAuto`), and utilizes various stores (`store_offers`, `store_paymentMethods`, `store_partnerAcquisitionOffer`, etc.). The component displays offers categorized as `payment_offer`, `shopify` based offers and handles auto-apply offers.  The UI is versioned (v1, v2, v3 styles), indicating support for different template designs based on the configuration (`store_paymentsGeneralConfig`).


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/CredPayApplied.svelte` (15:38:40): This component displays a visual confirmation when a CRED payment offer is applied.  The UI shows the discount amount (`store_partnerAcquisitionOffer.discountAmount`) and applied discount code.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` (15:39:02 - 15:39:53): This is a central component managing discounts and offers.  Multiple updates within a short time frame suggest significant refactoring or feature additions. It incorporates several sub-components (e.g., `WalletCredits`, `AvailableOffers`, `GiftCardInput`, `CredPayApplied`), handling various discount types, applying and removing coupons and  interacts extensively with numerous stores to manage the discount application process. The component also manages the application of one-click coupons.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/GokwikBnpl/GokwikBnpl.svelte` (15:40:58): This component displays information for Gokwik BNPL payment option and logs the `gokwik_bnpl_page_landed` event.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Gyftr/Balance.svelte` (15:41:55): This component manages the user's Gyftr balance, allowing them to add or redeem amounts.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Gyftr/Gyftr.svelte` (15:42:31): This component acts as a container for Gyftr functionality, using `Balance.svelte`. It also handles Shopify store credits.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentButtons/PSPOrderButtons.svelte` (15:42:57): This component renders payment buttons for various payment service providers (PSPs), particularly focusing on UPI apps. It dynamically shows/hides UPI apps based on availability and device type.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentUPI.svelte` (15:47:43 - 15:47:55): This component manages the UPI payment flow. Multiple updates were made within a short time span, suggesting iterative improvements or bug fixes. The component dynamically manages the display of UPI payment options based on device and availability, handles QR code display for cash-to-prepaid flows (`cashToPrepaidFlow`), and manages payment failures.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentButton.svelte` (16:05:01 - 16:06:29): This component renders individual payment method buttons.  The two updates within a short timeframe suggest bug fixes or refinement of the UI and the handling of various payment method types.  It uses `logEvent` for tracking and incorporates logic for handling COD (cash on delivery), UPI payments, and other payment methods.  The component uses experiments to dynamically show/hide payment methods like Snapmint and BharatxPay.  The component handles the logic for checking if the freebie is available or not.

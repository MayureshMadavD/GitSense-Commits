# Activity Summary for 25/02/2025

## 00:11:38
The log shows development activity focused on a checkout dashboard UI, specifically within the settings page.  The most significant changes occurred between 23:15:28 and 23:20:48 on 24/02/2025, involving the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` file.  These edits extensively modify the settings page's structure and functionality,  adding features related to merchant agreements, discount configurations, and user roles.  The `settingsList` array is heavily modified, adding numerous menu items for different discount types and settings.  The component also includes logic for handling user agreements and selecting between checkout platforms.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingerror.tsx` file was updated twice (23:18:15 and 23:18:55) with a minor change in the navigation path within the `Button` component, correcting the route to  `/checkout/settings/shipping/add`.

Between 23:20:23 and 23:20:48, the import path for `ShippingService` in `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` was adjusted, reflecting a reorganization of the shipping settings files.

Finally, a new component `ShippingService` in  `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingservice.tsx` was created and significantly developed between 23:39:20 and 23:51:34. This component evolved from a simple placeholder to a more complex component containing a tabbed interface using the `gokwik-ui-kit` library's `Tabs` component. The `config` and `saveConfig` props were consistently passed through several iterations, indicating a likely interaction with a configuration system.  The added functionality of the tab allows different aspects of shipping services to be managed.

The log shows updates to several files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory, primarily focused on enhancing settings and order management functionalities.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` (25/02/2025, 00:20:28): This file underwent a substantial update, adding significant React component logic for editing orders.  The code includes extensive use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components for creating a UI for managing order line items.  Key features include adding, removing, and modifying quantities of products, along with discount application logic (fixed amount and percentage discounts) and handling recently deleted items.  The code demonstrates complex state management using `useState` and `useSelector` (likely from Redux).

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` (25/02/2025, 00:35:00 & 25/02/2025, 00:35:24): This file manages the settings page UI and navigation.  Two nearly identical commits were made within seconds of each other. The second commit adds a 'Customise UI' setting. The file uses `react-router-dom` for navigation and `react-redux` for state management.  It dynamically renders settings sections based on user roles and configurations, including sections for pincode serviceability, shipping settings, discounts, integrations, and tax settings.  A significant portion of the code deals with dynamically creating menu items and handling the agreement signing process.  The addition of a polling mechanism (`setInterval`) to fetch and update agreement status is notable.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingservice.tsx` (25/02/2025, 00:38:46 - 25/02/2025, 01:01:09): This component, responsible for rendering shipping settings, underwent several iterative changes.  Initial commits involved basic tab setup using `gokwik-ui-kit`'s `Tabs` component. Subsequent commits refined the tab labels ('Tab 1' to 'Shipping Methods', 'Tab 2' to 'Weight Based Shipping').  A 'hidden' property was added to a tab and then removed. Finally, conditional rendering was added to show only the 'Shipping Methods' tab if no shipping configurations exist. The change to the `onChange` handler from simply logging the key to updating the active tab state is significant.  The component now conditionally renders tabs based on the presence of shipping configurations.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx` (25/02/2025, 00:51:30 - 25/02/2025, 00:53:10): This file displays the main shipping settings section.  The key change was renaming the prop passed to `ShippingService` from `config` to `shippingConfig` for clarity.  The file also includes conditional rendering to display a "NoShippingAvailableMessage" when no shipping options are available.

Overall, the changes reflect a consistent effort to improve the UI and functionality related to order management and merchant settings.  The use of `gokwik-ui-kit` is prominent, suggesting a unified design system. The pattern of iterative commits on `shippingservice.tsx` indicates a debugging or refinement process for the tabbed interface.  The usage of  `useSelector` and `useMemo` hooks across multiple files points to performance optimization.

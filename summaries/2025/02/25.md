# Activity Summary for 25/02/2025

## 00:11:38
The log shows development activity focused on a checkout dashboard UI, specifically within the settings page.  The most significant changes occurred between 23:15:28 and 23:20:48 on 24/02/2025, involving the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` file.  These edits extensively modify the settings page's structure and functionality,  adding features related to merchant agreements, discount configurations, and user roles.  The `settingsList` array is heavily modified, adding numerous menu items for different discount types and settings.  The component also includes logic for handling user agreements and selecting between checkout platforms.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingerror.tsx` file was updated twice (23:18:15 and 23:18:55) with a minor change in the navigation path within the `Button` component, correcting the route to  `/checkout/settings/shipping/add`.

Between 23:20:23 and 23:20:48, the import path for `ShippingService` in `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` was adjusted, reflecting a reorganization of the shipping settings files.

Finally, a new component `ShippingService` in  `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingservice.tsx` was created and significantly developed between 23:39:20 and 23:51:34. This component evolved from a simple placeholder to a more complex component containing a tabbed interface using the `gokwik-ui-kit` library's `Tabs` component. The `config` and `saveConfig` props were consistently passed through several iterations, indicating a likely interaction with a configuration system.  The added functionality of the tab allows different aspects of shipping services to be managed.

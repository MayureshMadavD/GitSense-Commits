# Activity Summary for 19/02/2025

## 10:58:31
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file between 10:47:20 and 10:49:21 on February 19, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on the same component related to order editing.  There are no substantive code changes across the revisions.  The code implements a React component for editing orders,  managing line items, discounts, and a UI for adding and removing products.  Key features include:

* **Line Item Management:**  The component uses a table to display line items, allowing users to increase/decrease quantity and delete items.  Deleted items are moved to a "recently deleted" section, allowing for re-addition.

* **Discount Management:**  A significant portion of the code handles discount application.  Users can add discounts with a title and value (fixed amount or percentage), and the UI updates to reflect the discount applied to each line item.  There's logic to handle error conditions (e.g., missing discount title or value).

* **UI Framework:** The code heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements like tables, buttons, modals, and more.

* **State Management:**  The component uses React's `useState` hook extensively to manage various aspects of the UI and data, including line items, modal state, discount information, and error messages.  It also integrates with Redux (`useSelector`) to access user and merchant details.

The multiple commits suggest a debugging or minor enhancement process rather than a large-scale refactoring. The lack of substantial changes across the three commits within a short timeframe points towards iterative development and small bug fixes or UI refinements.

The code defines a React component `OtherConfigs` for managing various merchant settings within a dashboard.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components for its UI elements.  It fetches and saves merchant configuration using a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook.

The core functionality revolves around a form (`Form` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`) containing multiple settings, primarily toggle switches (`Switch` component) for features like inventory checking, Shopify inventory updates, Shopify refund processing, custom email domains, user OTP verification, freebie attribution, and KwikPass multiple account creation.  One setting, "No COD on Variant Title", includes additional fields for selecting a match type and specifying variant titles.

The component uses `deepEqualAndDiff` to track changes and only saves modified settings via the `saveConfig` function.  The form's initial values are set based on the fetched `config` data.  The UI provides informative descriptions and alerts for each setting.  A "Save" button is enabled only when changes are detected.  The timestamp indicates that this version of the code was last modified on February 19th, 2025, at 2:44:41 PM.  The component uses several helper functions and constants from the `@library` and `@gokwik` packages.  Several settings include links ('knowMoreLink') that appear to point to documentation, although many are commented out in this version.  One link navigates internally within the application using `navigateToUrl('/rto/kwikflows')`.


## 15:21:46
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file between 14:57:20 and 15:01:47 on February 19, 2025, and a single revision of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` at 14:54:53 on the same day.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was also modified twice, with very minor changes between 14:54:11 and 14:54:22.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file contains HTML for a merchant page,  including a "click me" button that triggers a checkout process.  It initializes a `gokwikSdk` object which handles communication with a GoKwik checkout script (`gokwik.js`),  sets cookies for tracking landing page and referrer, and includes a substantial amount of JavaScript for managing merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`) and communication with the checkout process via `postMessage`.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file is a Svelte component that acts as the main application.  The significant changes across the multiple revisions are focused on handling messages received from the `window.postMessage` event.  Specifically, these changes concern:

* **Handling of `'launch'` messages:** The component receives a `'launch'` message containing various data points (e.g., `sourceValue`, `localStorageObject`, `merchantInfo`, `environment`, cart information,  request IDs etc.). This data is then used to update the application state using numerous Svelte stores.  The code carefully handles cases for different environments (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `production`, etc.), and manages various states related to the checkout flow.  Significant additions in subsequent commits include logging of `store_requestIdObject` and the addition of `store_requestIdObject.subscribe` to track changes in this store.

* **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling for empty carts and manages an `abcErrorMessage` variable.

* **Cookie and Local Storage Management:** The component uses cookies (`setCookie`, `getCookie`) and local storage to store and retrieve tokens (GoKwik and KwikPass) and other session data. It attempts to gracefully handle potential exceptions when accessing local storage.

* **Improved Logging:**  The `console.log` statements were added or modified across the revisions, likely for debugging purposes.

The revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` are minor. They primarily involve a small change within the `api_url` function, where a commented-out line (`//url = 'http://localhost:3000';`) is removed and another line (`url = 'https://sandbox.gokwik.co';`) becomes commented out in one version, while in the next revision  `url = 'https://sandbox.gokwik.co';` is uncommented, and two other lines are added and then commented out. These changes suggest experimentation with different API base URLs for the 'local' environment.  The code generally defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the current environment.

In summary, the codebase undergoes refinements primarily focused on enhancing message handling, error management, and improving robustness in dealing with different environments and potential local storage access issues. The changes reflect an iterative development process, with additions and refinements to improve the checkout functionality.

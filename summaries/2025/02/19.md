# Activity Summary for 19/02/2025

## 10:58:31
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file between 10:47:20 and 10:49:21 on February 19, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on the same component related to order editing.  There are no substantive code changes across the revisions.  The code implements a React component for editing orders,  managing line items, discounts, and a UI for adding and removing products.  Key features include:

* **Line Item Management:**  The component uses a table to display line items, allowing users to increase/decrease quantity and delete items.  Deleted items are moved to a "recently deleted" section, allowing for re-addition.

* **Discount Management:**  A significant portion of the code handles discount application.  Users can add discounts with a title and value (fixed amount or percentage), and the UI updates to reflect the discount applied to each line item.  There's logic to handle error conditions (e.g., missing discount title or value).

* **UI Framework:** The code heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements like tables, buttons, modals, and more.

* **State Management:**  The component uses React's `useState` hook extensively to manage various aspects of the UI and data, including line items, modal state, discount information, and error messages.  It also integrates with Redux (`useSelector`) to access user and merchant details.

The multiple commits suggest a debugging or minor enhancement process rather than a large-scale refactoring. The lack of substantial changes across the three commits within a short timeframe points towards iterative development and small bug fixes or UI refinements.


## 15:21:39
The code defines a React component `OtherConfigs` for managing various merchant settings within a dashboard.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components for its UI elements.  It fetches and saves merchant configuration using a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook.

The core functionality revolves around a form (`Form` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`) containing multiple settings, primarily toggle switches (`Switch` component) for features like inventory checking, Shopify inventory updates, Shopify refund processing, custom email domains, user OTP verification, freebie attribution, and KwikPass multiple account creation.  One setting, "No COD on Variant Title", includes additional fields for selecting a match type and specifying variant titles.

The component uses `deepEqualAndDiff` to track changes and only saves modified settings via the `saveConfig` function.  The form's initial values are set based on the fetched `config` data.  The UI provides informative descriptions and alerts for each setting.  A "Save" button is enabled only when changes are detected.  The timestamp indicates that this version of the code was last modified on February 19th, 2025, at 2:44:41 PM.  The component uses several helper functions and constants from the `@library` and `@gokwik` packages.  Several settings include links ('knowMoreLink') that appear to point to documentation, although many are commented out in this version.  One link navigates internally within the application using `navigateToUrl('/rto/kwikflows')`.


## 15:21:46
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file between 14:57:20 and 15:01:47 on February 19, 2025, and a single revision of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` at 14:54:53 on the same day.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was also modified twice, with very minor changes between 14:54:11 and 14:54:22.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file contains HTML for a merchant page,  including a "click me" button that triggers a checkout process.  It initializes a `gokwikSdk` object which handles communication with a GoKwik checkout script (`gokwik.js`),  sets cookies for tracking landing page and referrer, and includes a substantial amount of JavaScript for managing merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`) and communication with the checkout process via `postMessage`.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file is a Svelte component that acts as the main application.  The significant changes across the multiple revisions are focused on handling messages received from the `window.postMessage` event.  Specifically, these changes concern:

* **Handling of `'launch'` messages:** The component receives a `'launch'` message containing various data points (e.g., `sourceValue`, `localStorageObject`, `merchantInfo`, `environment`, cart information,  request IDs etc.). This data is then used to update the application state using numerous Svelte stores.  The code carefully handles cases for different environments (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `production`, etc.), and manages various states related to the checkout flow.  Significant additions in subsequent commits include logging of `store_requestIdObject` and the addition of `store_requestIdObject.subscribe` to track changes in this store.

* **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling for empty carts and manages an `abcErrorMessage` variable.

* **Cookie and Local Storage Management:** The component uses cookies (`setCookie`, `getCookie`) and local storage to store and retrieve tokens (GoKwik and KwikPass) and other session data. It attempts to gracefully handle potential exceptions when accessing local storage.

* **Improved Logging:**  The `console.log` statements were added or modified across the revisions, likely for debugging purposes.

The revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` are minor. They primarily involve a small change within the `api_url` function, where a commented-out line (`//url = 'http://localhost:3000';`) is removed and another line (`url = 'https://sandbox.gokwik.co';`) becomes commented out in one version, while in the next revision  `url = 'https://sandbox.gokwik.co';` is uncommented, and two other lines are added and then commented out. These changes suggest experimentation with different API base URLs for the 'local' environment.  The code generally defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the current environment.

In summary, the codebase undergoes refinements primarily focused on enhancing message handling, error management, and improving robustness in dealing with different environments and potential local storage access issues. The changes reflect an iterative development process, with additions and refinements to improve the checkout functionality.


## 16:21:49
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` between 15:29:29 and 16:21:36 on February 19, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the handling of `kpEmail` (likely a customer's email address).  Initially, `kpEmail` was hardcoded or conditionally set based on whether the email contained a comma. Subsequent changes introduced a conditional setting of `kpEmail` based on a boolean flag `kpEmailEdit` derived from  `store_requestIdObject.custom_config.kp_email_update_config`.  The `store_requestIdObject` is likely fetched from a server-side API call.  The presence of numerous console.log statements suggests debugging efforts during development. The code extensively uses Svelte stores for managing application state and interacts with various services (`MerchantAPI`, `EventService`, `Helper.service`, `Experiment.service`, `Discounts.service`) and components to manage a checkout flow.  The repeated, large code blocks indicate that these changes did not significantly alter the overall structure or functionality of the `App.svelte` component; rather, they concerned the logic and data handling.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` file was also modified between 16:12:45 and 16:20:58 on the same day. These changes centered around handling conditional rendering of address input fields and incorporating configuration settings from `store_requestIdObject`.  Specifically,  a boolean flag `isKpEmailEditConfig` was added to control email field editability based on a configuration received from the backend. The conditional logic manages different address input layouts (`oldaddressFields`, `newAddressFields`, `suggestedAddressFields`)  based on various store values, suggesting a flexible address input form that adapts to different scenarios or user interfaces.  The repeated large code blocks also suggest minor edits focused on conditional logic and configuration rather than large architectural changes.


## 18:21:44
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory between 17:23 and 18:21 on February 19, 2025.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` underwent three revisions in quick succession (17:23:55, 17:24:35, 17:25:12). These revisions appear to be minor code cleanups and likely involved refactoring or removing redundant imports.  No significant functional changes are apparent from the diffs.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/tax-settings/otherConfigs.tsx` was modified four times (18:01:40, 18:02:16, 18:07:15, 18:12:40, 18:14:25, 18:18:07, 18:21:28).  These changes focused on the `OtherConfigs` component, which appears to be a settings form for merchant configuration.  Specific changes include:

* **18:07:15:** A `hidden` property was added to a `switch` field (`kp_email_update_config`), conditionally hiding it based on the `enableKwikPass` state.  The code also restructured the rendering logic within the `fields.map` function to conditionally render fields using `field?.hidden`.

* **18:14:25:**  The `enableKwikPass` state was introduced and is now derived from the `merchant_config` object via `Form.useWatch`.  The visibility of the `kp_email_update_config` field depends on this variable.

* **18:18:07 & 18:20:46 & 18:21:28:** These revisions added  `useSelector` from `react-redux` to access `getMerchantDetails` and then `getUserDetails` and finally `getUserConfig` from the Redux store.  The console logs suggest debugging efforts related to accessing merchant and user data, which is then used to inform conditional rendering within the component.   The `enableKwikPass` variable was also set to `false` directly, indicating this functionality may have been disabled or is awaiting further implementation.

Throughout the changes to `/pages/settings/tax-settings/otherConfigs.tsx`, a pattern of adding and modifying configuration options related to inventory checks, Shopify refund processing, custom email domains, OTP verification, and COD blocking is evident.  The component utilizes a form structure, allowing users to save changes to the merchant's configuration.


## 18:21:50
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` between 16:22:14 and 17:17:02 on February 19, 2025.  The `App.svelte` file underwent numerous updates, primarily focusing on handling the `gokwikEvent` (a message event), which triggers various actions:

* **Data Handling:** The `gokwikEvent` contains crucial data like `cashToPrepaidFlag`, `isSkipOtp`, `merchantInfo`, `environment`, `cartObject`, `requestId`, and others.  The code processes this data, updating numerous Svelte stores (`store_...`) accordingly.  This involves setting cookies and localStorage items, particularly for Gokwik and Kwikpass tokens. There is also extensive handling for empty carts and abandon cart scenarios.

* **Conditional Logic:**  Extensive `if` and `else if` statements control the flow based on the received event data and the current page (`currentPage`).

* **API Calls:**  The code makes API calls (`fetchShopifyCart`, `getAbandonCart`, `getRequestId`) to fetch data from the merchant's backend.

* **Error Handling:** `APIErrorHandling` is utilized for displaying appropriate error messages to the user based on various error conditions.

The `AddressInputs.svelte` file, on the other hand, focuses on address input management:

* **Address Input Forms:** The code defines three different sets of address input fields (`oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, `suggestedAddressInputs`), conditional rendering based on the `store_newAddressLayout` and `store_additionalAddress` stores.  These stores control the layout and presence of additional address fields, such as recipient phone number and apartment name.  There's also logic for dynamically adding or removing input fields based on `$store_enableRecipientPhone` and `addressMMIFlow`.

* **Store Subscriptions:**  Numerous store subscriptions are used to keep the component synchronized with data changes in various stores, such as `store_selectedAddress`, `store_pincode`, `store_editAddress`.

* **Event Handling:** The `onMount` lifecycle method sets up event listeners and subscriptions, which allows the component to respond to different events. The `handleSubmit` function (implicitly called from `store_triggerContinueFunction`) indicates an address submission handling mechanism.


The most significant changes appear between the initial timestamps (around 16:22) and the final ones (around 17:17).  These later changes mainly involve refinements to the `kpEmail` handling in `App.svelte` and the addition of an `addressEmail` variable within `AddressInputs.svelte`.  The frequent updates to `App.svelte` suggest iterative development and bug fixing. A recurring pattern across the code is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores for managing application state and the extensive use of asynchronous operations and conditional logic to handle various scenarios.


## 19:21:41
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/tax-settings/otherConfigs.tsx` file.  All revisions pertain to a React component, `OtherConfigs`, which appears to be a settings form for configuring various merchant options within a dashboard.

The key changes across the revisions are minor.  The most significant alteration occurs between the first and second revision (18:22:50 and 18:23:07).  In this change, the variable `enableKwikPass` is modified from `let` to `const`, implying a change in how this variable's mutability is handled within the component.  This is a small change, but it suggests a potential refactor to improve code consistency.

The third revision (18:24:42) adds a `console.log(getUserConfiguration)` statement, likely for debugging purposes. This line is removed in the final revision (18:25:16), suggesting the debugging was complete.

The component itself manages various settings through a form.  These settings include inventory checks, Shopify inventory updates, Shopify refund processing, custom email domains, user OTP verification, freebie value attribution, and KwikPass-related configurations. Each setting is represented as a configurable "field" within the `fields` array, mostly using switch components. The `fields` array shows a consistent structure for defining each setting (type, name, label, description, etc.).  The form utilizes a custom `RenderField` component and the `deepEqualAndDiff` utility to manage and save changes efficiently. The `Save` button is disabled until changes are detected.  The use of `useSelector` and `useMerchantConfigApi` hooks indicates integration with Redux and a custom API for fetching and saving configuration data.

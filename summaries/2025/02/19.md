# Activity Summary for 19/02/2025

## 10:58:31
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file between 10:47:20 and 10:49:21 on February 19, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on the same component related to order editing.  There are no substantive code changes across the revisions.  The code implements a React component for editing orders,  managing line items, discounts, and a UI for adding and removing products.  Key features include:

* **Line Item Management:**  The component uses a table to display line items, allowing users to increase/decrease quantity and delete items.  Deleted items are moved to a "recently deleted" section, allowing for re-addition.

* **Discount Management:**  A significant portion of the code handles discount application.  Users can add discounts with a title and value (fixed amount or percentage), and the UI updates to reflect the discount applied to each line item.  There's logic to handle error conditions (e.g., missing discount title or value).

* **UI Framework:** The code heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements like tables, buttons, modals, and more.

* **State Management:**  The component uses React's `useState` hook extensively to manage various aspects of the UI and data, including line items, modal state, discount information, and error messages.  It also integrates with Redux (`useSelector`) to access user and merchant details.

The multiple commits suggest a debugging or minor enhancement process rather than a large-scale refactoring. The lack of substantial changes across the three commits within a short timeframe points towards iterative development and small bug fixes or UI refinements.

The code defines a React component `OtherConfigs` for managing various merchant settings within a dashboard.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components for its UI elements.  It fetches and saves merchant configuration using a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook.

The core functionality revolves around a form (`Form` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`) containing multiple settings, primarily toggle switches (`Switch` component) for features like inventory checking, Shopify inventory updates, Shopify refund processing, custom email domains, user OTP verification, freebie attribution, and KwikPass multiple account creation.  One setting, "No COD on Variant Title", includes additional fields for selecting a match type and specifying variant titles.

The component uses `deepEqualAndDiff` to track changes and only saves modified settings via the `saveConfig` function.  The form's initial values are set based on the fetched `config` data.  The UI provides informative descriptions and alerts for each setting.  A "Save" button is enabled only when changes are detected.  The timestamp indicates that this version of the code was last modified on February 19th, 2025, at 2:44:41 PM.  The component uses several helper functions and constants from the `@library` and `@gokwik` packages.  Several settings include links ('knowMoreLink') that appear to point to documentation, although many are commented out in this version.  One link navigates internally within the application using `navigateToUrl('/rto/kwikflows')`.

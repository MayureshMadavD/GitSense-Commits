# Activity Summary for 19/02/2025

## 10:58:31
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file between 10:47:20 and 10:49:21 on February 19, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor and iterative, focusing on the same component related to order editing.  There are no substantive code changes across the revisions.  The code implements a React component for editing orders,  managing line items, discounts, and a UI for adding and removing products.  Key features include:

* **Line Item Management:**  The component uses a table to display line items, allowing users to increase/decrease quantity and delete items.  Deleted items are moved to a "recently deleted" section, allowing for re-addition.

* **Discount Management:**  A significant portion of the code handles discount application.  Users can add discounts with a title and value (fixed amount or percentage), and the UI updates to reflect the discount applied to each line item.  There's logic to handle error conditions (e.g., missing discount title or value).

* **UI Framework:** The code heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements like tables, buttons, modals, and more.

* **State Management:**  The component uses React's `useState` hook extensively to manage various aspects of the UI and data, including line items, modal state, discount information, and error messages.  It also integrates with Redux (`useSelector`) to access user and merchant details.

The multiple commits suggest a debugging or minor enhancement process rather than a large-scale refactoring. The lack of substantial changes across the three commits within a short timeframe points towards iterative development and small bug fixes or UI refinements.

# Activity Summary for 17/02/2025

## 12:04:01
The log shows multiple updates to two files on February 17, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was modified three times.  These changes primarily involve alterations to the `api_url` function, which defines base URLs for various environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, and others).  The modifications appear to be adjustments to the URLs used for different environments, including adding or changing URLs for specific environments like 'local', 'qa-rto', 'qaone', 'qatwo', 'dev-core', 'qa-core' and 'sandbox-core'.  In one revision, the local environment's  `api_url` was changed from a localhost URL to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`.  Another noticeable change is the consistent use of conditional logic based on the `env` variable to determine the appropriate API base URL. The `setCart` function, which sets a cart object in a store, remains unchanged across the revisions. The timestamps for these modifications are 11:32:31, 11:53:26, and 11:53:37.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte` was updated once at 11:44:00.  This change involves a significant update to a Svelte component responsible for managing a bottom sheet UI element. The component handles various states related to payment, order status, and user interaction. The code incorporates several stores from `common/stores` for data management and utilizes Svelte actions (`onMount`, `onDestroy`) for lifecycle management. Functions such as `handleBottomSheetClose` and `handleOnpl` manage closing the bottom sheet and handling different payment scenarios, including UPI and card payments.  It also includes logic for handling different order statuses and logging events.  The update also seems to introduce handling for a new "Offer Banner" and updates the UI for handling multiple payment statuses.

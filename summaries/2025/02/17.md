# Activity Summary for 17/02/2025

## 12:04:01
The log shows multiple updates to two files on February 17, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was modified three times.  These changes primarily involve alterations to the `api_url` function, which defines base URLs for various environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, and others).  The modifications appear to be adjustments to the URLs used for different environments, including adding or changing URLs for specific environments like 'local', 'qa-rto', 'qaone', 'qatwo', 'dev-core', 'qa-core' and 'sandbox-core'.  In one revision, the local environment's  `api_url` was changed from a localhost URL to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`.  Another noticeable change is the consistent use of conditional logic based on the `env` variable to determine the appropriate API base URL. The `setCart` function, which sets a cart object in a store, remains unchanged across the revisions. The timestamps for these modifications are 11:32:31, 11:53:26, and 11:53:37.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte` was updated once at 11:44:00.  This change involves a significant update to a Svelte component responsible for managing a bottom sheet UI element. The component handles various states related to payment, order status, and user interaction. The code incorporates several stores from `common/stores` for data management and utilizes Svelte actions (`onMount`, `onDestroy`) for lifecycle management. Functions such as `handleBottomSheetClose` and `handleOnpl` manage closing the bottom sheet and handling different payment scenarios, including UPI and card payments.  It also includes logic for handling different order statuses and logging events.  The update also seems to introduce handling for a new "Offer Banner" and updates the UI for handling multiple payment statuses.


## 13:04:02
The log shows updates to three Svelte components and a service file within a checkout UI project.  Significant changes occurred between 12:04:27 and 12:23:02 on February 17, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` (12:04:27): This file, a Svelte component,  displays an order summary.  The updates focus heavily on dynamic calculations of the total price, incorporating various discounts (coupon, prepaid, partner acquisition, rewards, gift cards), COD charges, GST, and shipping.  The component uses numerous Svelte stores (`store_...`) from the `common/stores` directory to manage application state.  It also includes extensive event tracking using `fireGtmEvent` and `fireAnalyticsGa4` functions.  The component renders a collapsible order summary and handles updates to the cart, displaying a success message upon cart updates.  The code manages the display of various components based on the current page and application state.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/AvailableOffers.svelte` (12:05:02): This Svelte component manages the display and application of available and unavailable discount coupons. It fetches and displays offers, allowing users to manually enter coupon codes or automatically apply payment offers. The component interacts with various stores (`store_...`) to manage application state and the application of discounts.  It uses a `TEMPLATE_VERSIONS` object to handle different template versions based on configuration.  The component also features detailed logging and event tracking using `logEvent`. There is also significant logic to handle different types of offers (payment offers, cashback, etc.) and their application based on the current page and shopping cart state.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Helper.service.ts` (12:13:11, 12:22:52, 12:23:02): This file contains utility functions.  Multiple updates were made to this file, all within a short timeframe, indicating iterative development. The changes primarily involve managing application state through numerous store subscriptions (`store_...`). These subscriptions update variables based on the state of stores related to address, payment, order details, cart, and other aspects of the checkout flow. The functions in this file handle actions like closing popups (`closeBottomSheet`, `closeFullScreenPopUp`), setting addresses (`setAddress`),  handling autofill events (`autofillEvents`), and updating order stores (`setCreateOrderStores`).  The file contains helper functions for formatting numbers (`processNumber`) and retrieving badge titles (`getBadgeTitle`) based on merchant-specific configurations.  The repeated edits suggest debugging or refinement of these utility functions.  There is a pattern of extensive use of Svelte stores for state management.


## 15:03:59
The log shows multiple edits to the `.gitignore` file within a short timeframe (14:41:58 to 14:42:56 on February 17, 2025).  The primary change involves the path to `EnvironmentService.ts`. Initially, it was listed without a `public/src` prefix. This prefix was added incrementally across multiple commits,  finally settling on `/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` in the last commit.  All other entries in the `.gitignore` file remained consistent throughout the edits.  The repeated edits suggest a possible correction or refinement of the path specification for ignoring the `EnvironmentService.ts` file.


## 15:21:22
The `/Users/madav/Documents/kwikPass/kpbeon.js` file contains JavaScript code for onboarding a merchant onto the KwikPass platform.  The code, updated on 17/02/2025 at 14:21:23, uses Axios to interact with multiple APIs.

The key functionality involves several asynchronous functions:

*   **`getGkpMerchantConfig()`:** Retrieves merchant configuration data from `https://prod-platform-config.gokwik.io/graphql`.  It uses a GraphQL query to fetch details like `access_token`, `private_access_token`, and various merchant settings.

*   **`updateGkpMerchantConfig()`:** Updates the merchant's configuration on the same GraphQL endpoint, enabling features like WhatsApp login and OTP.

*   **`postKwikpassConfig()`:** Sends merchant configuration data to `https://prod-kwikpass-be-v3.gokwik.io/kp/api/v1/configurations`, including the `private_access_token` obtained previously and various other settings.  This function uses a `dev_key` for authentication.

*   **`whitelistMerchantUrl()`:** Adds URLs (`websiteUrl` and the Shopify URL) to a whitelist on `https://prod-kwikpass-be-v3.gokwik.io/kp/api/v1/whitelist`, again using the `dev_key`.

*   **`postLoginModalComponents()`:** Posts configuration for the login modal components to `https://prod-kwikpass-be-v3.gokwik.io/kp/api/v1/dashboard/components/merchants`, specifying details like colors, text, and icons. This also utilizes the `dev_key`.

*   **`completeDataPull()`:** Initiates a data pull via a POST request to `https://prod-kwikpass-be-v3.gokwik.io/kp/api/v1/onboarding/complete-onboarding`.

*   **`onboardMerchantOnKwikpass()`:** The main function orchestrating the entire onboarding process, sequentially calling the other functions.

The code includes extensive error handling using `try...catch` blocks for each API call.  A recurring element is the use of `dev_key` for authentication across multiple API endpoints.  The code also uses a specific `merchantId` (`193ws1fi1kqw`) and `themeId` (148633288943) throughout.  The significant change timestamp is 17/02/2025, 14:21:23, representing the last update to the code.

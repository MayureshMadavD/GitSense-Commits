# Activity Summary for 11/02/2025

## 13:04:04
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file on November 2nd, 2025.  All revisions contain essentially identical code.  The differences are extremely minor and likely due to  insignificant whitespace or formatting changes within the Svelte component. The timestamps indicate that the edits were made within a short timeframe (11:46:54, 11:47:43, and 11:49:25). The core functionality of the Discounts component, which heavily relies on numerous Svelte stores for managing discount application, user data, and UI state, remains unchanged across all three revisions.  The component uses various services for fetching and applying discounts, handling gift cards, and interacting with the user interface.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/GA4.ts` file was updated twice on November 2nd, 2025.  Both updates involved the same file and had nearly identical content. The only discernible difference lies within the `gaPurchase` function.  In the second update (13:32:54), a minor change was made to the calculation of the `totalValue` variable within the `gaPurchase` function. In the first version (13:12:49), `totalValue` was calculated as `data.totalValue + data?.commonAnalyticsData?.codCharges`, while in the second it is simplified to `data?.commonAnalyticsData?.codCharges ? parseFloat(totalValue) : parseFloat(data.totalValue)`. This suggests a correction or refinement in how the total value is handled when COD charges are present.

The code implements GA4 event tracking for various checkout steps (begin_checkout, add_shipping_info, add_payment_info, purchase, coupon-related events) and other custom events containing '_gk'.  It uses a conditional structure to determine whether additional data is passed and handles different data structures accordingly based on whether the domain is `snitch.co.in`.  The `createItemsBody` function prepares item data for GA4, handling different data structures based on  the presence of  `additionalData`. The  `createItemsBodyForSnitch` function is specifically designed for `snitch.co.in`, adapting the data format for that platform. The `triggerGAEvent` function dispatches events to either `gtag` or `dataLayer` depending on whether the current URL includes 'snitch.co.in'.  The code extensively uses conditional logic and object destructuring.

The provided code represents a React component (`OrderDetails`) responsible for displaying order details.  Two versions are shown, with timestamps indicating a minor update between 15:16:55 and 15:18:49 on November 2nd, 2025.  The changes between these versions are not apparent from the provided snippets, as both are truncated at the same point.


The component fetches order data via an API call (`makeAPICall`) using  `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` (environment variable which is not shown in the logs) and  `APIEndPoints.getOrderById(id)`.  It processes the refund data to merge repeated refunds, handling different bank statuses (`payment_successful`, `payment_failed`, `pending`, `timeout`).  The component uses `useSelector` from `react-redux` to access user information like merchant status and configuration.

Significant logic exists for calculating and displaying various price breakdowns (discounts, taxes, shipping, gifts, and rewards) based on the fetched order data.  The `keyInformation` variable prepares data for displaying key order attributes, adapting the displayed fields based on whether the user is a merchant and the merchant's platform (e.g., Shopify).  The UI likely utilizes components from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The overall functionality suggests a comprehensive order details page within an e-commerce dashboard.

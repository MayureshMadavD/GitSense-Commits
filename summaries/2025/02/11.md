# Activity Summary for 11/02/2025

## 13:04:04
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file on November 2nd, 2025.  All revisions contain essentially identical code.  The differences are extremely minor and likely due to  insignificant whitespace or formatting changes within the Svelte component. The timestamps indicate that the edits were made within a short timeframe (11:46:54, 11:47:43, and 11:49:25). The core functionality of the Discounts component, which heavily relies on numerous Svelte stores for managing discount application, user data, and UI state, remains unchanged across all three revisions.  The component uses various services for fetching and applying discounts, handling gift cards, and interacting with the user interface.

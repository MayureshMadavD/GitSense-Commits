# Activity Summary for 12/02/2025

## 14:15:35
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/AvailableOffers.svelte` (last updated 12/02/2025, 13:25:34) displays available and unavailable discount offers.  It uses numerous stores from `common/stores` to manage application state, including offers, payment methods, user information, and screen size.

The component fetches and displays offers, differentiating between available and unavailable coupons based on criteria like `viewInListing`, minimum order value, and number of items.  Available offers are categorized (Payment Offer, Special Offer, etc.) and may include auto-apply features.  Payment offers are handled differently, with a separate API call and state management.  The UI dynamically updates based on store subscriptions, including screen size adjustments for Cred offers.  Event logging (`logEvent`) is used to track user interactions with offers.  Error handling is included for discount API calls. The component also handles the display of terms and conditions, expanding and collapsing them based on user interaction.  Extensive conditional rendering ensures the correct display of information based on offer types and statuses.  The user can manually apply coupons via input field and pressing enter.  A significant portion of the code deals with handling various offer types and presentation logic, particularly for payment offers and Cred partnerships.  There is a versioning system (`TEMPLATE_VERSIONS`) suggesting potential UI variations.

# Activity Summary for 12/02/2025

## 14:15:35
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/AvailableOffers.svelte` (last updated 12/02/2025, 13:25:34) displays available and unavailable discount offers.  It uses numerous stores from `common/stores` to manage application state, including offers, payment methods, user information, and screen size.

The component fetches and displays offers, differentiating between available and unavailable coupons based on criteria like `viewInListing`, minimum order value, and number of items.  Available offers are categorized (Payment Offer, Special Offer, etc.) and may include auto-apply features.  Payment offers are handled differently, with a separate API call and state management.  The UI dynamically updates based on store subscriptions, including screen size adjustments for Cred offers.  Event logging (`logEvent`) is used to track user interactions with offers.  Error handling is included for discount API calls. The component also handles the display of terms and conditions, expanding and collapsing them based on user interaction.  Extensive conditional rendering ensures the correct display of information based on offer types and statuses.  The user can manually apply coupons via input field and pressing enter.  A significant portion of the code deals with handling various offer types and presentation logic, particularly for payment offers and Cred partnerships.  There is a versioning system (`TEMPLATE_VERSIONS`) suggesting potential UI variations.


## 16:15:46
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp`  source code between 15:04 and 16:14 on December 2nd, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be on the checkout UI, specifically the OTP input component and the bottom sheet component.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (15:04:32): This file was updated to manage environment-specific base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestion, main API, cred URL, experiment, twidpay, kp, CDN path, and analytics).  The code extensively uses the `env` variable to determine the appropriate URL based on the environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  A `setCart()` function initializes a cart object with sample data, likely for local development.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (15:04:38 & 15:06:12): This file, representing the merchant's HTML page, remained largely unchanged in the two revisions shown. It contains a button triggering the `goKwikCheckout()` function, which sends `merchantInfo` (containing environment, merchant ID, etc.) via a `postMessage` event.  The code also includes cookie management for `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`.  There are commented-out sections related to script loading, suggesting experimentation or previous implementations.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` (15:08:54, 15:09:14, 15:14:57, 15:17:15, 15:47:21, 15:47:49): This Svelte component is the main application file and underwent significant changes across multiple commits.  The core functionality involves handling communication between the main app and an iFrame (likely the Gokwik checkout), processing launch data from the iFrame, and managing various application states.  Notable additions include handling of Shopify carts (`isHydrogen` flag), managing loaders, and extensive error handling.  These changes suggest improvements to the checkout flow and error handling, potentially dealing with various scenarios (abandoned carts, different payment methods, etc.). There is also much activity relating to handling and managing cookies and local storage, showing emphasis on secure data management.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/OtpInput.svelte` (15:21:15, 15:26:29, 15:33:38, 15:37:10, 15:40:56, 16:03:52, 16:05:02, 16:06:23, 16:06:37, 16:10:44, 16:12:21, 16:12:53, 16:14:09): This file, responsible for the OTP input screen, was heavily modified throughout the log.  The most significant changes involve refinements to the user interface, enhanced error handling, and improvements to the OTP verification process, especially integrating the handling of the bottom sheet.  The code shows progressive changes, adding features and fixing issues related to various scenarios and edge cases in the OTP handling process. There are minor UI changes in wording and addition of formatting for phone numbers. Changes relating to the  `disableOtpBottomSheet()`  function were introduced to improve the UI flow.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/utils/TextConstants.ts` (15:48:39): This file contains various constants related to text displayed in the UI, including error messages, button text, and placeholder text. No structural changes were made in this file only some text changes were made.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte` (15:58:17, 15:58:57, 16:00:50): This component, handling the bottom sheet UI element, was revised to add more sophisticated handling of payment statuses (pending, success, failure), improve UI feedback for the user during these states, and enhance visual appearance. The changes added more logging capabilities relating to event tracking, especially relating to the Order Now Pay Later (ONPL) feature and the various states of the bottom sheet such as success, pending and failure states. The  `background-color`  of the container was also changed from  `#039855`  to  `transparent`.


In summary, the code changes focus on improving the user experience and reliability of the Gokwik checkout UI. Several updates involved enhancements to error handling, the addition of more detailed logging, and adjustments to address various payment scenarios and edge cases around OTP verification and bottom sheet management.  The modifications suggest an iterative development process involving bug fixes, UI refinements, and the addition of new features.


## 20:45:36
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src` directory, focusing primarily on Svelte components.  The most significant changes occur between 19:04:10 and 19:16:29,  all affecting the `BottomSheet.svelte` component. These changes involve refinements to the component's styling and functionality, particularly regarding payment status display and handling.  The updates consistently involve adjustments to class names, conditional rendering based on `paymentStatus`,  and the addition of event logging for various payment statuses (PENDING, INITIATE, SUCCESS, FAIL).  The `otp-page` class is also repeatedly adjusted in relation to the `isOtpPage` property in `componentData`.  The styling changes are mainly focused on the visual presentation of the bottom sheet,  adding animations and improving layout based on screen size and payment status.

Prior to these changes, updates to `MobilePhoneInput.svelte` (18:35:57) and `OtpInput.svelte` (18:50:36) introduce substantial Svelte code for handling user login and OTP verification.  Both components heavily rely on various Svelte stores for managing application state, making extensive use of subscriptions and reactive statements (`$:`).  `MobilePhoneInput.svelte` focuses on phone number input validation and API calls to verify user phone numbers, while `OtpInput.svelte` handles OTP submission and subsequent API calls for verification. Both components utilize event tracking and analytics services.

The `App.svelte` file (18:48:59) is updated to incorporate and manage these components. It acts as the main application entry point, handling various aspects of the checkout flow, including messaging from iframes, loading screens, error handling, and the routing logic between the different checkout steps. This component also shows heavy use of store subscriptions to react to state changes across the application.  The update to this file reflects the addition of several new UI components.


## 21:45:37
The log shows multiple revisions to two Svelte components: `BottomSheet.svelte` and `OtpInput.svelte`, and one TypeScript file `OrderStore.ts` and one TypeScript file `CommonStore.ts` between 20:49:39 and 21:42:34 on December 2, 2025.


`BottomSheet.svelte`:  The major changes in `BottomSheet.svelte` involve enhancements to the UI and logic handling payment statuses (INITIATE, PENDING, SUCCESS, FAIL).  Several commits added features like displaying offer banners (pages 11 and 12), showing payment status animations, and improved conditional rendering based on payment type and current page. A final commit added a conditional message  "Address Found {addressCount}" or "Enter Details to begin" to the `address-count` span element on page 2.


`OtpInput.svelte`: This component, dealing with OTP input, underwent revisions primarily focused on OTP verification and error handling.  The `submitOTP` function was modified to handle different OTP types ('login', 'view-addresses', 'cod') and to manage various states after successful or failed verification. This includes setting cookies and local storage values related to Gokwik tokens and user information.  A significant portion of the code involves logging events for analytics purposes.


`OrderStore.ts`: This file contains numerous writable Svelte stores related to order information, including shipping, payment methods, and order status. It appears that several stores were added or modified during this period, and the updates likely reflect an expansion of the application's capabilities.  The main changes appear to be in the management of payment and order information.


`CommonStore.ts`: This file also has numerous writable Svelte stores for common application data, such as cart information, user preferences, and merchant details.  The updates to this file appear to involve modifications to how certain aspects of application state are handled.  The main changes appear to be in the management of user data and application preferences.

The frequent commits suggest iterative development and debugging, with a focus on refining the checkout flow and improving error handling in both the UI and backend interactions.  There's a recurring theme of extensive event logging for analytics and tracking various stages of the user's journey through the checkout process.

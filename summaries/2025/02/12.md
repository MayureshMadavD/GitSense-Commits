# Activity Summary for 12/02/2025

## 14:15:35
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/AvailableOffers.svelte` (last updated 12/02/2025, 13:25:34) displays available and unavailable discount offers.  It uses numerous stores from `common/stores` to manage application state, including offers, payment methods, user information, and screen size.

The component fetches and displays offers, differentiating between available and unavailable coupons based on criteria like `viewInListing`, minimum order value, and number of items.  Available offers are categorized (Payment Offer, Special Offer, etc.) and may include auto-apply features.  Payment offers are handled differently, with a separate API call and state management.  The UI dynamically updates based on store subscriptions, including screen size adjustments for Cred offers.  Event logging (`logEvent`) is used to track user interactions with offers.  Error handling is included for discount API calls. The component also handles the display of terms and conditions, expanding and collapsing them based on user interaction.  Extensive conditional rendering ensures the correct display of information based on offer types and statuses.  The user can manually apply coupons via input field and pressing enter.  A significant portion of the code deals with handling various offer types and presentation logic, particularly for payment offers and Cred partnerships.  There is a versioning system (`TEMPLATE_VERSIONS`) suggesting potential UI variations.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp`  source code between 15:04 and 16:14 on December 2nd, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be on the checkout UI, specifically the OTP input component and the bottom sheet component.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (15:04:32): This file was updated to manage environment-specific base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestion, main API, cred URL, experiment, twidpay, kp, CDN path, and analytics).  The code extensively uses the `env` variable to determine the appropriate URL based on the environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  A `setCart()` function initializes a cart object with sample data, likely for local development.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (15:04:38 & 15:06:12): This file, representing the merchant's HTML page, remained largely unchanged in the two revisions shown. It contains a button triggering the `goKwikCheckout()` function, which sends `merchantInfo` (containing environment, merchant ID, etc.) via a `postMessage` event.  The code also includes cookie management for `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`.  There are commented-out sections related to script loading, suggesting experimentation or previous implementations.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` (15:08:54, 15:09:14, 15:14:57, 15:17:15, 15:47:21, 15:47:49): This Svelte component is the main application file and underwent significant changes across multiple commits.  The core functionality involves handling communication between the main app and an iFrame (likely the Gokwik checkout), processing launch data from the iFrame, and managing various application states.  Notable additions include handling of Shopify carts (`isHydrogen` flag), managing loaders, and extensive error handling.  These changes suggest improvements to the checkout flow and error handling, potentially dealing with various scenarios (abandoned carts, different payment methods, etc.). There is also much activity relating to handling and managing cookies and local storage, showing emphasis on secure data management.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/OtpInput.svelte` (15:21:15, 15:26:29, 15:33:38, 15:37:10, 15:40:56, 16:03:52, 16:05:02, 16:06:23, 16:06:37, 16:10:44, 16:12:21, 16:12:53, 16:14:09): This file, responsible for the OTP input screen, was heavily modified throughout the log.  The most significant changes involve refinements to the user interface, enhanced error handling, and improvements to the OTP verification process, especially integrating the handling of the bottom sheet.  The code shows progressive changes, adding features and fixing issues related to various scenarios and edge cases in the OTP handling process. There are minor UI changes in wording and addition of formatting for phone numbers. Changes relating to the  `disableOtpBottomSheet()`  function were introduced to improve the UI flow.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/utils/TextConstants.ts` (15:48:39): This file contains various constants related to text displayed in the UI, including error messages, button text, and placeholder text. No structural changes were made in this file only some text changes were made.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte` (15:58:17, 15:58:57, 16:00:50): This component, handling the bottom sheet UI element, was revised to add more sophisticated handling of payment statuses (pending, success, failure), improve UI feedback for the user during these states, and enhance visual appearance. The changes added more logging capabilities relating to event tracking, especially relating to the Order Now Pay Later (ONPL) feature and the various states of the bottom sheet such as success, pending and failure states. The  `background-color`  of the container was also changed from  `#039855`  to  `transparent`.


In summary, the code changes focus on improving the user experience and reliability of the Gokwik checkout UI. Several updates involved enhancements to error handling, the addition of more detailed logging, and adjustments to address various payment scenarios and edge cases around OTP verification and bottom sheet management.  The modifications suggest an iterative development process involving bug fixes, UI refinements, and the addition of new features.

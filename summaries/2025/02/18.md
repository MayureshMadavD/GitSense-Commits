The provided code represents a Svelte component (`Discounts.svelte`) responsible for handling discounts and offers within a checkout UI.  Two revisions are shown, separated by a short time interval (25 seconds).  The revisions are virtually identical; no functional changes are apparent in the provided snippets.

The component heavily relies on numerous Svelte stores from `CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, and `OrderStore`, managing various aspects of the checkout process, including cart details, user information, address, payment methods, discount codes, offers, and rewards.  It interacts with multiple services for fetching and applying discounts (`Discounts.service`, `MerchantAPI`, `WalletCredits.service`, `ShippingDiscount.service`, `GiftCard.service`), handling events (`EventService`), and displaying UI feedback (`snackbar_state`).

The code incorporates extensive logic for handling various discount types (including one-click coupons, automatic discounts, and partner acquisition offers), managing their application and removal, and updating the UI accordingly.  Error handling is included for invalid coupon codes.  The component also accounts for different discount stacking configurations and scenarios involving store credits, gift cards, and loyalty programs.  The use of `onMount` and subscriptions to numerous stores indicates a reactive approach to updating the UI based on changes in the application state.  The `showOffersListing` variable dynamically controls the visibility of offers depending on the presence of available and unavailable discounts.

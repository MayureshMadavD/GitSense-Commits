# Activity Summary for 18/02/2025

## 14:03:58
The provided code represents a Svelte component (`Discounts.svelte`) responsible for handling discounts and offers within a checkout UI.  Two revisions are shown, separated by a short time interval (25 seconds).  The revisions are virtually identical; no functional changes are apparent in the provided snippets.

The component heavily relies on numerous Svelte stores from `CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, and `OrderStore`, managing various aspects of the checkout process, including cart details, user information, address, payment methods, discount codes, offers, and rewards.  It interacts with multiple services for fetching and applying discounts (`Discounts.service`, `MerchantAPI`, `WalletCredits.service`, `ShippingDiscount.service`, `GiftCard.service`), handling events (`EventService`), and displaying UI feedback (`snackbar_state`).

The code incorporates extensive logic for handling various discount types (including one-click coupons, automatic discounts, and partner acquisition offers), managing their application and removal, and updating the UI accordingly.  Error handling is included for invalid coupon codes.  The component also accounts for different discount stacking configurations and scenarios involving store credits, gift cards, and loyalty programs.  The use of `onMount` and subscriptions to numerous stores indicates a reactive approach to updating the UI based on changes in the application state.  The `showOffersListing` variable dynamically controls the visibility of offers depending on the presence of available and unavailable discounts.

The log shows multiple updates to two React component files (`index.tsx`) within the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages` directory,  and one EJS template file.  There are no changes to files containing environment variables.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` underwent several revisions between 18:27:28 and 18:58:45 on February 18, 2025.  These changes primarily involved modifications to a React component responsible for editing order details. The component heavily uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and  `@gokwik/utilities` for API calls and other utilities. The updates focus on managing line items, discounts, and UI elements related to adding, deleting, and modifying products within an order.  The `discount` state variable is extensively used, suggesting a significant focus on discount application and management functionality.  Specific changes include updates to how quantity is modified, handling of deleted items, and the UI for discount application.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` was updated twice on February 18, 2025, at 18:41:55 and 18:42:05.  These minor revisions to the order details component likely involved bug fixes or minor UI adjustments as there are no major structural or functional changes mentioned. The component fetches order details via API calls, processes refund data (including merging repeated refunds), and displays key order information and price breakdowns.  The use of `useMemo` and `useCallback` suggests optimization efforts.  A notable change in the later revision was the adjustment of the `setDisableEdit` state in the `setEditTitle` function when GWP discounts are applied, potentially enabling editing in this scenario.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` was updated at 18:28:03 on February 18, 2025. This EJS template file appears to be responsible for configuring the dashboard UI, dynamically loading modules based on the environment (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The updates involve changes to the import map, specifying different URLs for various Gokwik modules depending on the environment.  The production environment also includes Clarity and New Relic monitoring code.  The structure of the import map suggests a microservices architecture.

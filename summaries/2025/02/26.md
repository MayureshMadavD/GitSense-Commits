# Activity Summary for 26/02/2025

## 07:57:16
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingservice.tsx`  between 23:32:29 and 23:58:29 on February 25, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the UI component for shipping settings.

Early changes involved structuring the component using `Form`, `Row`, `Col`, `Drawer`, `Tabs`, and `Upload` components from the `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The code defines fields for configuring shipping prices (name, price, min/max order value),  and adds a drawer for advanced conditions, including external shipping matches, user-type based discounts, and COD charges.  A CSV upload feature is also implemented to allow bulk upload of data.

Between 23:35:07 and 23:37:43, the upload functionality was improved, removing the `action` prop from `Inputs` and adding a `Divider` component to improve visual separation.  Around 23:37:13,  a Form Item was added around the Dragger component in the Drawer, which was further modified to include a label "Upload List of Serviceable PIN Codes" at 23:36:36.

Further modifications (23:38:22 onwards) centered on enhancing the UI: adding `overflow-y-auto` to enable scrolling within the Drawer and Form components for better handling of larger content, and adding `className='p-0 m-0'` to `Divider` to remove default padding and margins. The `colon` prop was set to `false` in Form.Item elements at 23:44:22 to control the display of colons.


Finally, an `Alert` component was added at 23:51:55 to provide instructions on using a sample CSV file, and subsequently enhanced to include a download link for the sample file and a `DownloadOutlined` icon at 23:55:22 and updated to use `InfoCircleOutlined` at 23:56:49. The icon size was adjusted at 23:57:16 and the Alert styling was refined using `className='w-full'`  and `p-0` within the description p tag at 23:58:00 and 23:58:29.  Throughout the edits, there's a consistent use of functional components and the `gokwik-ui-kit` library.


## 13:19:47
The log shows numerous edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingservice.tsx` between 11:19:56 and 13:16:36 on February 26, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the UI component responsible for managing shipping settings.

Specific updates include:

* **Initial Version (11:19:56):**  The initial commit introduces a `ShippingService` component using `gokwik-ui-kit` components to create a form for configuring shipping methods.  It includes sections for basic shipping price configuration, advanced conditions (accessed via a drawer), and an upload functionality for serviceable PIN codes.  A tabbed interface is also present, allowing for different shipping configurations (e.g., Shipping Method, Weight Based Shipping).

* **Drawer Improvements (11:20:43 - 11:26:41):** Several commits iteratively improve the drawer's layout, adding more fields for configuring discounted shipping based on user type and COD charges, controlled by a switch.  The styling and information display within the drawer are also refined using additional UI elements like `Alert` and `Divider` from the `gokwik-ui-kit`. The `Alert` component's styling and content also undergo changes.

* **Information Display Refactoring (11:26:06 - 11:31:57):** A significant change involves refactoring the information display regarding sample file format.  The `Alert` component is replaced with a custom styled `<span>` element containing `InfoCircleOutlined` and  `Download Sample` button. The styling of this custom component undergoes several adjustments. Ultimately, the `Alert` component is removed entirely.

* **Sample File Integration (12:08:06 - 12:08:59):** The sample CSV file (`samplefile`) is imported from `'../../../../public/assets/sample_file.csv'` and its path is linked in the `Download Sample` button's `<a>` tag.  This allows a direct download of the sample file. A `download` attribute is added to the `<a>` tag.

* **Form Field Addition (12:15:08 - 12:17:59):** A new form field and related UI elements are added for managing whether a shipping method is visible on checkout and including a Shopify tag.  A `Switch` component is used for checkout visibility, and a further section is added to add Shopify tags, showing the use of a new `Switch` component and an additional `Input` field.

* **Layout Refinements (12:19:15 - 12:35:53):** The layout of multiple sections, especially in the drawer, is improved using `Row`, `Col`, and flexbox properties (`flex`, `flex-row`, `justify-between`, `align-middle`, `gap`).  Margin and padding are also adjusted. The `Divider` component is styled to improve the visual presentation of the form.

* **Form Field Naming (12:30:15):** The name attribute for the 'Upload List of Serviceable PIN Codes' form element is changed to `'[shipping_prices][pincodes]'`.

* **Final Version (12:38:26 - 13:16:36):** The final changes include adding a `switch` to control shipping visibility by default as true and improving the drawer footer with the addition of a `Discard` button.


The overall pattern is one of iterative refinement:  the initial structure remains consistent, but numerous changes focus on improving usability, aesthetics, and functionality of the UI elements within the `ShippingService` component.  The most significant changes occurred around the implementation of the sample file download link, and the addition of sections related to checkout visibility and Shopify tagging, along with frequent styling and layout adjustments.

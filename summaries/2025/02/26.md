# Activity Summary for 26/02/2025

## 07:57:16
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingservice.tsx`  between 23:32:29 and 23:58:29 on February 25, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the UI component for shipping settings.

Early changes involved structuring the component using `Form`, `Row`, `Col`, `Drawer`, `Tabs`, and `Upload` components from the `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The code defines fields for configuring shipping prices (name, price, min/max order value),  and adds a drawer for advanced conditions, including external shipping matches, user-type based discounts, and COD charges.  A CSV upload feature is also implemented to allow bulk upload of data.

Between 23:35:07 and 23:37:43, the upload functionality was improved, removing the `action` prop from `Inputs` and adding a `Divider` component to improve visual separation.  Around 23:37:13,  a Form Item was added around the Dragger component in the Drawer, which was further modified to include a label "Upload List of Serviceable PIN Codes" at 23:36:36.

Further modifications (23:38:22 onwards) centered on enhancing the UI: adding `overflow-y-auto` to enable scrolling within the Drawer and Form components for better handling of larger content, and adding `className='p-0 m-0'` to `Divider` to remove default padding and margins. The `colon` prop was set to `false` in Form.Item elements at 23:44:22 to control the display of colons.


Finally, an `Alert` component was added at 23:51:55 to provide instructions on using a sample CSV file, and subsequently enhanced to include a download link for the sample file and a `DownloadOutlined` icon at 23:55:22 and updated to use `InfoCircleOutlined` at 23:56:49. The icon size was adjusted at 23:57:16 and the Alert styling was refined using `className='w-full'`  and `p-0` within the description p tag at 23:58:00 and 23:58:29.  Throughout the edits, there's a consistent use of functional components and the `gokwik-ui-kit` library.

# Activity Summary for 23/02/2025

## 16:25:04
The codebase consists of two main files: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/barChart.jsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/dailyreport.jsx`.  `barChart.jsx` contains functions for generating charts, while `dailyreport.jsx` uses these functions to display daily reports.


`barChart.jsx` underwent multiple revisions between 15:30:55 and 15:47:40 on February 23, 2025. The core functionality remained consistent: calculating weekly ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) and the number of merchants per week for SMB (Small and Medium-sized Businesses) and emerging merchants.  The changes primarily involved refinements to error handling and data filtering within the `calculateWeeklyARR` and `calculateMerchantsPerWeek` functions, ensuring robustness and handling edge cases more effectively.  No significant algorithmic changes were made.


`dailyreport.jsx` was modified between 15:32:08 and 15:32:50 on February 23, 2025. The updates focused on improving the UI presentation of the daily report.  Specifically, the changes involved restructuring the layout of the charts (`EmergingMerchantsChart` and `EmergingMerchantsChartForExpress`) within the `Details For Chart` section, using a `span` element with flexbox for better spacing and alignment.  No functional changes to data processing or fetching were made in this file during this time.  The addition of `AB Ratio` column in `live Merchant SMB/ENT` table was added in this file.

# Activity Summary for 23/02/2025

## 16:25:04
The codebase consists of two main files: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/barChart.jsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/dailyreport.jsx`.  `barChart.jsx` contains functions for generating charts, while `dailyreport.jsx` uses these functions to display daily reports.


`barChart.jsx` underwent multiple revisions between 15:30:55 and 15:47:40 on February 23, 2025. The core functionality remained consistent: calculating weekly ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) and the number of merchants per week for SMB (Small and Medium-sized Businesses) and emerging merchants.  The changes primarily involved refinements to error handling and data filtering within the `calculateWeeklyARR` and `calculateMerchantsPerWeek` functions, ensuring robustness and handling edge cases more effectively.  No significant algorithmic changes were made.


`dailyreport.jsx` was modified between 15:32:08 and 15:32:50 on February 23, 2025. The updates focused on improving the UI presentation of the daily report.  Specifically, the changes involved restructuring the layout of the charts (`EmergingMerchantsChart` and `EmergingMerchantsChartForExpress`) within the `Details For Chart` section, using a `span` element with flexbox for better spacing and alignment.  No functional changes to data processing or fetching were made in this file during this time.  The addition of `AB Ratio` column in `live Merchant SMB/ENT` table was added in this file.

The log shows multiple code changes across several files within a Svelte-based checkout UI application.  The most significant updates occur in `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte` between 20:33:18 and 20:53:26.  These changes primarily involve enhancements to the bottom sheet component's UI, particularly in its handling of payment status display (including visual animations and status messages for pending, success, and failure states), and the addition of a map image and address count display for the OTP input page (page 2).

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` (20:31:48) showcases the initial application setup, importing numerous components, stores, and services, indicating a complex checkout flow involving various payment options, address management, user authentication (OTP), and loading screens. The code heavily relies on Svelte stores for state management and numerous API calls to handle different aspects of the checkout process.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/utils/TextConstants.ts` (20:32:34 and 20:32:40) contains almost identical commits, demonstrating a minor, inconsequential change in the code.  This file defines various text constants and error messages used throughout the application, suggesting a focus on user experience and error handling.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/MobilePhoneInput.svelte` (20:46:39) shows the implementation of mobile phone number input and validation. The code handles user input, performs validation, makes API calls for phone number submission and cart updates, and triggers various events and analytics tracking.  It also incorporates logic to handle different user types and scenarios such as partial address pre-filling and the application of loyalty program points.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/OtpInput.svelte` (20:47:53 to 20:50:36)  shows iterative changes to the OTP input component, improving the user interface, adding error handling and analytics, and refining the flow for handling OTP verification, new user registration, address handling, and redirecting the user to the next steps in the checkout process. There are multiple edits focused on improving the UI and functionality related to address pre-filling and the flow.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` (20:58:36) demonstrates the implementation of a discount application component.  The code manages discount code input, API calls for discount application and removal,  handling of various discount types, credit application/removal and interacts with numerous stores to update the checkout state accordingly.  Significant logic is included for managing multiple discount types and offers.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Helper.service.ts` (20:54:41 and 20:54:48) contains almost identical commits, showcasing a minor, inconsequential edit. This file provides utility functions for various tasks such as handling the bottom sheet, address management, and autofill detection, showcasing the helper functions used in the checkout process.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/assets/images/map.svg` (20:42:02) represents a simple image file addition, likely used within the BottomSheet component for visual enhancement, specifically in the address selection section.


The codebase exhibits a consistent pattern of extensive use of Svelte stores for state management, frequent API calls, comprehensive error handling, and detailed event tracking for analytics purposes.  Many changes are focused on enhancing the user experience and improving error handling.

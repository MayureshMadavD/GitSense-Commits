## 11:04:22
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory between 10:39 AM and 10:49 AM on June 2nd, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts`  underwent two revisions.  The first revision at 10:39:23 AM defined numerous TypeScript interfaces, including `InputOption`, `InputConfig`, `SearchFilters`, `FilterCreatorModel`, `ShippingBreakups`, `PriceBreakup`, `StoreCredits`, `storeItems`, `EditOrderLineItems`, `Discount`, `EditOrderPayload`, `Order`, `LineItem`, `Transaction`, `CartItem`, `Refund`, `OrderData`,  `Comment`, `Shipping`, `AbandonedCart`, `ConversionStep`, `ConversionData`, `AnalyticsDate`, `UtmListParams`, `DiscountCodeConfig`, and `Product`. These interfaces seem to represent data structures for a checkout dashboard application, covering aspects like order details, line items, transactions, refunds, carts, and analytics. The second revision at 10:47:57 AM involved a minor change within the `PriceBreakup` interface;  the `postEditOrderShipping` field's type was changed from `number` to `any`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` underwent four revisions between 10:39:45 AM and 10:49:19 AM. This file is a React component responsible for displaying order details. The changes primarily focused on refining the handling and display of order data, particularly price breakdowns (discounts, taxes, shipping).  Specific improvements include:

* **10:39:45 AM:** Initial commit showing the component's structure.
* Subsequent revisions (10:42:14 AM, 10:42:29 AM, 10:43:15 AM, 10:44:40 AM, 10:44:58 AM, 10:45:14 AM, 10:47:42 AM, 10:48:18 AM, and 10:49:19 AM) involved iterative changes to  `fetchOrderDetails` function which fetches and processes order data, handling refund calculations, and updating the component's state.  The `mergeRepeatedRefunds` function was added to consolidate multiple refund attempts.  The `useMemo` hook was extensively used to optimize calculations and data transformations for display. A significant modification involved converting a `postEditOrderShipping` value to a number within `shippingBreakup` useMemo.

A recurring pattern across revisions of `/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` is the continuous refinement of the price breakdown calculations and the way the order data is fetched, processed, and displayed.  The  `priceBreakupValues` object is repeatedly accessed and used to calculate various totals. The repeated modifications suggest debugging and enhancement of the data handling logic and visual representation.


## 12:04:58
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent numerous updates between 11:17:42 and 11:49:31 on June 2nd, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the UI component for editing orders.  Specific modifications include:  handling of line items (adding, deleting, modifying quantities), discount application logic (including different discount types and error handling), and updates to the structure of the `shippingPrice` state (from `amount` and `title` to `shipping_name` and `shipping_fee`).  An `useEffect` hook was added to log changes to `shippingPrice`, suggesting debugging or monitoring of this state.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` file was updated three times on June 2nd, 2025, between 11:21:16 and 11:29:56. The changes revolved around the display and handling of order details.  A significant portion of the updates involves the calculation and display of price breakups, including discounts, taxes, and shipping charges.  The code includes a `mergeRepeatedRefunds` function to consolidate refund data, improving data presentation.  The updates also incorporate improved handling of various order statuses and payment methods (like COD) in the calculation of refundable amounts, and more detailed information of discounts applied to the orders.  There's also a noticeable addition of navigational links for non-merchant users to access order analytics.


## 15:06:15
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`.  The changes span from 12:13 PM to 13:57 PM on June 2nd, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on enhancements to the display and calculation of order details.  Changes included:

* **Refund Logic:**  The `mergeRepeatedRefunds` function was refined to handle refund attempts more accurately, categorizing refund status based on bank status (`payment_successful`, `payment_failed`, `pending`, `timeout`). The calculation of refundable amounts was improved to take into account various transaction statuses.

* **Discount Calculation:**  The calculation of `total_discount` was modified to include additional discount types (`payment_offers_applied`, `discount_total`, `reward_total`), making the discount breakdown more comprehensive.  The `discountBreakup` useMemo function was also adjusted to reflect these changes and now includes a new 'Payment Offer Discount' section.  The `taxBreakup` and `shippingBreakup` functions also include additional fields from price breakup.

* **UI Enhancements:**  The code includes updates related to displaying order information, possibly involving changes to the UI layout and presentation of data (though the specifics are not directly evident).  A new `setDisableEdit` and `setTitle` state variables and functions have been added to disable order updates based on applied discounts or rewards.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`  underwent extensive modifications related to the implementation of order editing features. The changes include:

* **Discount Management:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around managing discounts, including adding, removing, and applying discounts to individual line items.  The `discount` state object manages various aspects of discount application, including types (`fixed_amount`), values, titles, and the list of affected items. The UI for managing discounts is also heavily modified.

* **Line Item Management:** The component now allows for adding, deleting, and modifying the quantity of line items. The UI for handling line items quantity, including using `MinusCircleOutlined` and `PlusCircleOutlined` for quantity adjustments, is implemented.  There's also a mechanism to add products from a search component (`SearchProduct`). Deleted items are stored in `recentlyDeletedItems` state.

* **Product Search:**  The `SearchProduct` component interacts with an API (`/productSearch`) to fetch products for addition to the order. It features debouncing to improve performance and provides visual feedback to the user. The search UI now has a `SearchOutlined` icon.

* **UI Framework:** The `gokwik-ui-kit` is heavily used, indicating a consistent UI framework is in place.

* **Redux Integration:** `useSelector` hooks suggest that the component integrates with a Redux store to manage application state, particularly user details and configuration (`getMerchantDetails`, `isMerchantSelector`, `getUserConfig`).

In summary, the code changes reflect a substantial effort in improving the order details display and implementing a comprehensive order editing functionality, utilizing a consistent UI framework and integrating with a Redux store for state management.  The changes were made in a relatively short timeframe.


## 17:04:16
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` directory between 16:51 and 17:03 on June 2nd, 2025.  Both files are related to discount and shipping functionalities in a checkout UI.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` underwent two revisions.  The key changes appear to be minor bug fixes and adjustments to error handling within the `callShippingDiscountApi` and `processShippingDiscountResponse` functions.  These functions handle API calls related to shipping discounts, processing responses, and updating various store variables reflecting discount application status, shipping options, and total price.  The use of confetti effects upon successful coupon application is also observed.  There is extensive use of observable stores to manage application state.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` shows four revisions. This Svelte component manages the UI for displaying and applying discounts. The most substantial changes are additions and modifications to the `onMount` function, where numerous subscriptions to various stores are added.  These subscriptions react to changes in data like  available offers, discount application status,  and user address selection, updating the UI accordingly. The component includes logic for handling different types of discounts (e.g., one-click coupons, automatic discounts, partner offers, and store credit), using various services for API calls and state management. There's a notable emphasis on managing the display of available discounts, one-click coupon applications, and error handling during discount application or removal.  The component leverages Svelte's reactivity features (`$:`) for efficient state updates.

The provided log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`  between 17:04:55 and 17:06:57 on June 2nd, 2025.  The code itself remained largely unchanged across these revisions. All the changes appear to be inconsequential, likely due to automatic formatting or minor whitespace adjustments during the editing process.  There are no functional differences observable in the code between these revisions.  The file contains TypeScript code for handling shipping discounts, interacting with various stores (CommonStore, OrderStore, LoginStore), making API calls (`discountShippingCall`, `updateCart`), and managing user interface elements (snackbar, loader).  The code extensively uses reactive programming patterns through observable subscriptions (`subscribe`). The functions `callShippingDiscountApi` and `processShippingDiscountResponse` are central to the logic, handling API responses and updating store states based on the outcome of discount and shipping calculations.  Confetti effects are triggered upon successful coupon application.  Error handling and logging are also integrated.


## 18:04:22
The log shows updates to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src` directory, both related to order management within a dashboard UI.  The first file, `order-details/index.tsx`, was updated at 17:24:08 on 06/02/2025. This commit involved significant changes to the `OrderDetails` component, focusing on displaying and manipulating order details.  The code includes functions for fetching, processing, and displaying order information, including refunds, price breakdowns (discounts, taxes, shipping), and order status.  It uses React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`), Redux selectors (`useSelector`), and custom utility functions (`makeAPICall`, etc.).  The component heavily relies on data structuring and manipulation, specifically handling refunds and merging repeated refund attempts.

The second file, `edit-orders/index.tsx`, underwent two updates on 06/02/2025. The first at 17:24:28 and a second, nearly identical update, at 17:26:11.  These commits show substantial changes to a component responsible for editing order details. The component allows modification of line items (adding, removing, changing quantities), applying discounts, and managing the overall order structure.  It uses similar technologies and patterns as `order-details/index.tsx`, including React hooks, component library (`gokwik-ui-kit`), and custom helper functions. The edits demonstrate a focus on managing line items, discounts (both fixed and percentage-based), and displaying data in tables.  The close timing of the second update suggests either a quick correction or iterative development on the discount functionality.  The core functionality of the component remains largely unchanged between the two updates, with only minor differences.

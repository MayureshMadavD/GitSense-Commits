# Activity Summary for 06/02/2025

## 11:04:22
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory between 10:39 AM and 10:49 AM on June 2nd, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts`  underwent two revisions.  The first revision at 10:39:23 AM defined numerous TypeScript interfaces, including `InputOption`, `InputConfig`, `SearchFilters`, `FilterCreatorModel`, `ShippingBreakups`, `PriceBreakup`, `StoreCredits`, `storeItems`, `EditOrderLineItems`, `Discount`, `EditOrderPayload`, `Order`, `LineItem`, `Transaction`, `CartItem`, `Refund`, `OrderData`,  `Comment`, `Shipping`, `AbandonedCart`, `ConversionStep`, `ConversionData`, `AnalyticsDate`, `UtmListParams`, `DiscountCodeConfig`, and `Product`. These interfaces seem to represent data structures for a checkout dashboard application, covering aspects like order details, line items, transactions, refunds, carts, and analytics. The second revision at 10:47:57 AM involved a minor change within the `PriceBreakup` interface;  the `postEditOrderShipping` field's type was changed from `number` to `any`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` underwent four revisions between 10:39:45 AM and 10:49:19 AM. This file is a React component responsible for displaying order details. The changes primarily focused on refining the handling and display of order data, particularly price breakdowns (discounts, taxes, shipping).  Specific improvements include:

* **10:39:45 AM:** Initial commit showing the component's structure.
* Subsequent revisions (10:42:14 AM, 10:42:29 AM, 10:43:15 AM, 10:44:40 AM, 10:44:58 AM, 10:45:14 AM, 10:47:42 AM, 10:48:18 AM, and 10:49:19 AM) involved iterative changes to  `fetchOrderDetails` function which fetches and processes order data, handling refund calculations, and updating the component's state.  The `mergeRepeatedRefunds` function was added to consolidate multiple refund attempts.  The `useMemo` hook was extensively used to optimize calculations and data transformations for display. A significant modification involved converting a `postEditOrderShipping` value to a number within `shippingBreakup` useMemo.

A recurring pattern across revisions of `/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` is the continuous refinement of the price breakdown calculations and the way the order data is fetched, processed, and displayed.  The  `priceBreakupValues` object is repeatedly accessed and used to calculate various totals. The repeated modifications suggest debugging and enhancement of the data handling logic and visual representation.

The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent numerous updates between 11:17:42 and 11:49:31 on June 2nd, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on refining the UI component for editing orders.  Specific modifications include:  handling of line items (adding, deleting, modifying quantities), discount application logic (including different discount types and error handling), and updates to the structure of the `shippingPrice` state (from `amount` and `title` to `shipping_name` and `shipping_fee`).  An `useEffect` hook was added to log changes to `shippingPrice`, suggesting debugging or monitoring of this state.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` file was updated three times on June 2nd, 2025, between 11:21:16 and 11:29:56. The changes revolved around the display and handling of order details.  A significant portion of the updates involves the calculation and display of price breakups, including discounts, taxes, and shipping charges.  The code includes a `mergeRepeatedRefunds` function to consolidate refund data, improving data presentation.  The updates also incorporate improved handling of various order statuses and payment methods (like COD) in the calculation of refundable amounts, and more detailed information of discounts applied to the orders.  There's also a noticeable addition of navigational links for non-merchant users to access order analytics.


## 15:06:15
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`.  The changes span from 12:13 PM to 13:57 PM on June 2nd, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on enhancements to the display and calculation of order details.  Changes included:

* **Refund Logic:**  The `mergeRepeatedRefunds` function was refined to handle refund attempts more accurately, categorizing refund status based on bank status (`payment_successful`, `payment_failed`, `pending`, `timeout`). The calculation of refundable amounts was improved to take into account various transaction statuses.

* **Discount Calculation:**  The calculation of `total_discount` was modified to include additional discount types (`payment_offers_applied`, `discount_total`, `reward_total`), making the discount breakdown more comprehensive.  The `discountBreakup` useMemo function was also adjusted to reflect these changes and now includes a new 'Payment Offer Discount' section.  The `taxBreakup` and `shippingBreakup` functions also include additional fields from price breakup.

* **UI Enhancements:**  The code includes updates related to displaying order information, possibly involving changes to the UI layout and presentation of data (though the specifics are not directly evident).  A new `setDisableEdit` and `setTitle` state variables and functions have been added to disable order updates based on applied discounts or rewards.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`  underwent extensive modifications related to the implementation of order editing features. The changes include:

* **Discount Management:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around managing discounts, including adding, removing, and applying discounts to individual line items.  The `discount` state object manages various aspects of discount application, including types (`fixed_amount`), values, titles, and the list of affected items. The UI for managing discounts is also heavily modified.

* **Line Item Management:** The component now allows for adding, deleting, and modifying the quantity of line items. The UI for handling line items quantity, including using `MinusCircleOutlined` and `PlusCircleOutlined` for quantity adjustments, is implemented.  There's also a mechanism to add products from a search component (`SearchProduct`). Deleted items are stored in `recentlyDeletedItems` state.

* **Product Search:**  The `SearchProduct` component interacts with an API (`/productSearch`) to fetch products for addition to the order. It features debouncing to improve performance and provides visual feedback to the user. The search UI now has a `SearchOutlined` icon.

* **UI Framework:** The `gokwik-ui-kit` is heavily used, indicating a consistent UI framework is in place.

* **Redux Integration:** `useSelector` hooks suggest that the component integrates with a Redux store to manage application state, particularly user details and configuration (`getMerchantDetails`, `isMerchantSelector`, `getUserConfig`).

In summary, the code changes reflect a substantial effort in improving the order details display and implementing a comprehensive order editing functionality, utilizing a consistent UI framework and integrating with a Redux store for state management.  The changes were made in a relatively short timeframe.

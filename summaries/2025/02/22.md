# Activity Summary for 22/02/2025

## 00:14:10
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressListing.svelte` file between 23:16:11 and 00:09:02 on February 21st and 22nd, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions:  retrieving and displaying a list of addresses, allowing users to select an address, and handling address validation and error messages.  The changes primarily involve refinements to address validation logic, error handling, and event tracking (GTM and analytics).

No significant structural changes to the component are observed.  The code consistently uses Svelte stores (`store_*`) for managing application state, making extensive use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for API calls.


Specific changes across revisions include:

* **Address Validation:** The `addressValidate` function undergoes minor modifications in several revisions, likely to improve its accuracy and robustness.  These modifications might include adjustments to regular expressions for name and address validation or more precise handling of edge cases.

* **Error Handling:**  The display of error messages is tweaked.  There are adjustments in the `snackbar_state` settings (timeout values) and minor changes within conditional logic determining what error message to show.

* **Event Tracking:** The code includes consistent use of `fireGtmEvent` and `logEvent` functions to track user interactions and page loads.  Some revisions may add or modify details within these events, likely for improved analytics data.

* **Import Statements:** The import of `fade` from `svelte/transition` is added around 00:07:52, suggesting a visual transition effect was implemented for UI elements.

The consistent nature of the changes and the lack of major structural alterations imply iterative debugging and improvement rather than a complete rewrite of the component. The timestamps indicate a period of active development and refinement.

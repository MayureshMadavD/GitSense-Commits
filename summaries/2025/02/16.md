The provided code represents Svelte components for managing discounts and gift cards within a checkout UI.  Significant changes occurred on February 16th, 2025, between 14:16 and 14:17.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/gift-card/GiftCardsArray.svelte` (14:16:46): This component displays a list of applied gift cards.  It uses a Svelte store (`store_giftCard`) to manage the gift card array,  renders each card, showing the amount used and last digits of the card code.  A close button allows removal via `removeGiftCard` service function.  The styling uses SCSS to create a visually appealing card display with a custom scrollbar.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` (14:17:24): This is a more complex component handling various discount mechanisms. It heavily relies on numerous Svelte stores from `../../../common/stores/CommonStore` and `../../../common/stores/LoginStore` and `../../../common/stores/OrderStore`, managing state for cart ID, payment methods, addresses, discounts, coupons, loyalty programs, gift cards, and other checkout-related data. The component interacts with several services (`Discounts.service`, `EventService`, `ApiService`, `MerchantAPI`, `WalletCredits.service`, `ShippingDiscount.service`, `GiftCard.service`) to apply, remove, and manage discounts. It features a substantial amount of logic for handling different discount types (automatic, manual, one-click coupons, stacked discounts), credit application, and various UI states.  Error handling and analytics tracking (`fireGtmEvent`, `stabilityEvent`, `logEvent`) are integrated.  The component also renders sub-components like `WalletCredits`, `AvailableOffers`, `GiftCardInput`, `ButtonWithTooltip`, `CredPayApplied`, and `Ribbon`.  A significant portion of the code handles the complexities of discount stacking and interactions between different discount types and loyalty programs. The component's logic accounts for various edge cases and scenarios related to discount application, removal, and UI updates.

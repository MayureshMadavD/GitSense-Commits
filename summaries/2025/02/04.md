# Activity Summary for 04/02/2025

## 12:34:48
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`.

The `apiEndpoints.ts` file was modified three times on April 2nd, 2025.  The most significant change between the first and second versions was the correction of the `getAddressByCustomerId` endpoint URL to include `/api/dashboard/` prefix, changing it from `/address?customer_id=${id}` to `/api/dashboard/address?customer_id=${id}`. The subsequent changes to this file appear to be minor and did not alter the content of the API endpoints.

The `index.tsx` file was modified twice on April 2nd, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the `useEffect` hook responsible for fetching address data.  The second version added a `.catch` block to handle potential errors during the API call, improving error handling. The third version removed the dependency of the useEffect hook from `addressList`, possibly to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  The component uses a substantial amount of UI elements from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and includes extensive logic for handling order line items, discounts, and UI updates based on those interactions.  The code manages a complex state for discount application, including recently deleted items and discount types.

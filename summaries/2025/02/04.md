# Activity Summary for 04/02/2025

## 12:34:48
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`.

The `apiEndpoints.ts` file was modified three times on April 2nd, 2025.  The most significant change between the first and second versions was the correction of the `getAddressByCustomerId` endpoint URL to include `/api/dashboard/` prefix, changing it from `/address?customer_id=${id}` to `/api/dashboard/address?customer_id=${id}`. The subsequent changes to this file appear to be minor and did not alter the content of the API endpoints.

The `index.tsx` file was modified twice on April 2nd, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the `useEffect` hook responsible for fetching address data.  The second version added a `.catch` block to handle potential errors during the API call, improving error handling. The third version removed the dependency of the useEffect hook from `addressList`, possibly to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  The component uses a substantial amount of UI elements from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and includes extensive logic for handling order line items, discounts, and UI updates based on those interactions.  The code manages a complex state for discount application, including recently deleted items and discount types.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` and one revision to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx`.

The `login.tsx` file was updated at 12:41:04 on 04/02/2025.  This update involved adding a login customization section to a settings page, using components like `RichTextEditor`, `ColorPicketComponent`, and form elements from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The component handles saving configuration data using `useMerchantConfigApi` and provides UI for customizing banner content, button text, consent text, and background/text colors.  The component uses a series of controlled inputs and switches to allow the user to select different customization options.

The `richtexteditor.tsx` component underwent several revisions between 12:36:53 and 12:47:25 on 04/02/2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: a rich text editor with bold, italic, underline, and link functionalities,  limiting input to 64 characters.  Key changes across the revisions include:

* **12:36:53:** Initial version of the rich text editor.  It featured basic formatting options and link insertion via a modal.  The component extracts formatted text and plain text from the editor's HTML content.

* **12:42:02:** An `useEffect` hook was added to update the editor's content (`selectedValue`) when the prop changes. This ensures initial content loads correctly.

* **12:43:29:** The `useEffect` hook added in the previous revision was commented out.

* **12:43:50:** The `useEffect` hook was reinstated but changed to only run once after the component mounts (`[]` dependency array). This fixes the prop update problem and improves efficiency.

* **12:45:11:** The `useEffect` hook was removed completely, suggesting the initial content rendering was resolved in a different way.

* **12:47:25:**  The final revision uses `useRef` to manage the `selectedValue` prop, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.  This is a performance optimization.

In summary, the `richtexteditor.tsx` file underwent several iterations to improve its performance and initial content rendering, while the `login.tsx` file added a fully functional login customization section leveraging the rich text editor.  The pattern of iterative improvements on `richtexteditor.tsx` highlights a focus on optimizing the component's behavior and responsiveness.


## 14:34:48
The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` file was updated on 04/02/2025 at 14:02:57.  This update involved a comprehensive revision of API endpoints.  The changes primarily consist of adding or modifying numerous endpoint URLs for various functionalities.  These functionalities cover a wide range of features, including:

* **Order Management:** Retrieving orders by ID, fetching all orders, managing abandoned carts, and editing orders.
* **Merchant Management:** Retrieving merchant lists, managing pincodes (including upload, download, and enabling), and updating merchant information.
* **Analytics:**  A significant portion of the update focuses on adding many endpoints for various analytics dashboards, covering checkout funnels, order metrics, social metrics, marketing metrics, payment metrics, product performance, customer retention, discount usage, and more.  These are grouped under the `checkoutAnalytics` object.  Further analytics endpoints are also available for marketing campaigns and order analytics.
* **Discount Management:**  Extensive endpoints are added for creating, managing, and retrieving discounts, including generating discount codes, managing discount files (uploads and downloads), and searching for products and customers related to discounts. This is broken down into `discountConfig` and `diyDiscounts` objects.
* **Shopify Integration:** Several endpoints related to Shopify integration are included, covering customer fetching, customer segment retrieval, collection fetching, and merchant configurations.
* **Utility Functions:** Endpoints for downloading logos and generating pre-signed URLs for file uploads are present.
* **Health and Status:** Endpoints for checking merchant and global system health are included.
* **Column Preferences:** Endpoints to manage column preferences are added.


The update shows a pattern of organizing endpoints logically into nested objects based on their functionality. The use of functions for dynamic endpoint generation (e.g., `getOrderById`, `getDiscount`) is also observed.  The sheer volume of added endpoints suggests a significant expansion or restructuring of the application's API interaction capabilities.


## 15:34:56
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx`  between 15:28:12 and 15:34:31 on 04/02/2025.  The primary changes involve the UI component for customizing the login screen.

The initial version (15:28:12) included functionality for a banner, primary button text, and consent section, all with associated visibility toggles and settings.  The code used `useMerchantConfigApi` to fetch and save configuration data.

Subsequent revisions (15:29:32, 15:30:09, 15:31:00) primarily focused on refining the `handleVisibilityChange` function. Initially, this function only updated the `visibility` state. Later versions were modified to also update the `loginData` state accordingly, ensuring consistency between UI state and the data to be saved.  A `console.log` statement was added to `handleFormSubmit` in one revision and later removed.

A notable change in the revision at 15:32:28 replaces the `isInputCheck` key in the `visibility` state with `isBannerEnabled`. This modifies how the banner's visibility is managed.

The final revision (15:34:31) replaces `isInputCheck` with `isContinueButtonVisible`, further restructuring how the primary button's text input is shown/hidden.  The `handleInputChange` function is also adjusted to reflect this change.  Throughout the revisions, the core functionality remains consistent, but the state management related to visibility toggles is iteratively improved for better consistency and clarity.  The `handleVisibilityChange` function now updates both the `visibility` and `loginData` states.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` shows a single entry at 15:20:49 on 04/02/2025. This file contains a React component for editing orders. The component uses a table to display order line items, with functionality for adding, removing, and modifying quantities. It also includes features for managing discounts and a modal for confirming item deletion.  The component interacts with an API (`makeAPICall`) and utilizes Redux (`useSelector`) for state management.  A significant portion of the code deals with calculating totals and applying discounts, taking into account various discount types and recently deleted items.


## 16:34:50
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/payments.tsx` file between 15:37 and 15:40 on 04/02/2025.  These changes primarily involve minor adjustments and additions to the code, focusing on the `handleVisibilityChange` function. Specifically, the updates ensure that  `paymentData` is also updated when visibility changes are made. A `console.log(paymentData)` statement was added to the `handleFormSubmit` function at 15:39:27.  The final version of this file at 15:40:00 remains largely unchanged from the previous iteration at 15:39:27.


A  `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` file was updated at 15:38:56 on 04/02/2025. This file introduces a UI component for login customization, featuring functionality for banner display, button text input, consent section management, and color customization using a `ColorPicketComponent` and `RichTextEditor`. The component uses `useMerchantConfigApi` for configuration management.


The  `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` file was updated at 15:43:02 on 04/02/2025. This update adds or modifies numerous API endpoints, suggesting expansion of the application's functionality related to orders, addresses, merchants, pincodes, refunds, discounts, and analytics.  Many endpoints seem to relate to Shopify integration ("shopify" is frequently present in the endpoint path).


Finally, the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file was updated at 16:05:51 on 04/02/2025. This file is a React component for editing orders, it uses  `gokwik-ui-kit` components extensively and interacts with APIs (using `makeAPICall`) to fetch and update order details. It includes features for managing line items (adding, deleting, modifying quantity), discounts (fixed amount and percentage), and displaying order information in a table.  The component interacts with a Redux store (`useSelector`) for merchant details and makes API calls to the endpoints defined in `apiEndpoints.ts`.  The code suggests significant functionality and complexity related to handling and updating order details.


## 19:35:00
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`, a React component likely responsible for editing order details in a dashboard.  The changes span from 18:35:14 to 19:20:05 on April 2nd, 2025.

The most significant changes revolve around the management of discounts and line items in an order.  Initially, there was a commented-out `useEffect` hook fetching address data using an API call. This call was later uncommented in a subsequent commit.  The code extensively uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.  A `discount` state variable manages various aspects of discounts, including:

*   `recentlyDeletedItems`:  An array tracking recently deleted items.
*   `isModalVisible`: A boolean for discount modal visibility.
*   `discountType`:  Specifies whether the discount is a fixed amount or a percentage.
*   `discountValue`: The numerical value of the discount.
*   `discountTitle`: The title of the discount.
*   `discountApplied`:  A flag indicating whether a discount has been applied.
*   Other fields: `discountButtonLabel`, `discountVisible`, `addProductModal`, `preAppliedDiscount`, `fetchedItems`, `discountedItems`, `itemToDelete`, and `itemDiscount` that manage the discount feature's state and flow.

The component features a table displaying order line items, with functionality to modify quantities, delete items (moving them to `recentlyDeletedItems`), and re-add previously deleted items.  The total calculation dynamically adjusts based on applied discounts.  There are functions like `modifyQty`, `deleteItem`, `handleReAddItem`, `handleRemoveDiscounts`, and `handleOk` for managing line items and discounts.  Error handling is implemented using the `message.error` function from `gokwik-ui-kit`.

Around 18:42:53, a minor change was made to the `isQuantityModified` function, possibly refining its logic for checking quantity changes. Subsequent changes between 18:43:39 and 18:46:53 involved further minor adjustments to  `shouldHideUI` function,likely related to UI updates based on discount status and data consistency checks.  Finally, a notable change occurred at 18:58:53 where the initial state of `selectedOption` was changed from 1 to 0, indicating a potential change in the default selected option within the component.  The very last change at 19:20:05 appears to be only cosmetic, with no significant code alterations.  The overall pattern suggests iterative development and refinement of the discount and line item management functionality within the order editing component.

# Activity Summary for 04/02/2025

The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`.

The `apiEndpoints.ts` file was modified three times on April 2nd, 2025.  The most significant change between the first and second versions was the correction of the `getAddressByCustomerId` endpoint URL to include `/api/dashboard/` prefix, changing it from `/address?customer_id=${id}` to `/api/dashboard/address?customer_id=${id}`. The subsequent changes to this file appear to be minor and did not alter the content of the API endpoints.

The `index.tsx` file was modified twice on April 2nd, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the `useEffect` hook responsible for fetching address data.  The second version added a `.catch` block to handle potential errors during the API call, improving error handling. The third version removed the dependency of the useEffect hook from `addressList`, possibly to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  The component uses a substantial amount of UI elements from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and includes extensive logic for handling order line items, discounts, and UI updates based on those interactions.  The code manages a complex state for discount application, including recently deleted items and discount types.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` and one revision to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx`.

The `login.tsx` file was updated at 12:41:04 on 04/02/2025.  This update involved adding a login customization section to a settings page, using components like `RichTextEditor`, `ColorPicketComponent`, and form elements from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The component handles saving configuration data using `useMerchantConfigApi` and provides UI for customizing banner content, button text, consent text, and background/text colors.  The component uses a series of controlled inputs and switches to allow the user to select different customization options.

The `richtexteditor.tsx` component underwent several revisions between 12:36:53 and 12:47:25 on 04/02/2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: a rich text editor with bold, italic, underline, and link functionalities,  limiting input to 64 characters.  Key changes across the revisions include:

* **12:36:53:** Initial version of the rich text editor.  It featured basic formatting options and link insertion via a modal.  The component extracts formatted text and plain text from the editor's HTML content.

* **12:42:02:** An `useEffect` hook was added to update the editor's content (`selectedValue`) when the prop changes. This ensures initial content loads correctly.

* **12:43:29:** The `useEffect` hook added in the previous revision was commented out.

* **12:43:50:** The `useEffect` hook was reinstated but changed to only run once after the component mounts (`[]` dependency array). This fixes the prop update problem and improves efficiency.

* **12:45:11:** The `useEffect` hook was removed completely, suggesting the initial content rendering was resolved in a different way.

* **12:47:25:**  The final revision uses `useRef` to manage the `selectedValue` prop, avoiding unnecessary re-renders.  This is a performance optimization.

In summary, the `richtexteditor.tsx` file underwent several iterations to improve its performance and initial content rendering, while the `login.tsx` file added a fully functional login customization section leveraging the rich text editor.  The pattern of iterative improvements on `richtexteditor.tsx` highlights a focus on optimizing the component's behavior and responsiveness.

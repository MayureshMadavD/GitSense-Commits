# Activity Summary for 03/02/2025

## 11:03:52
The log shows modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 20:52:19 and 21:08:32 on January 31, 2025.  These revisions appear to be incremental changes, with no substantial structural alterations to the code. The changes primarily focus on refining the component's handling of discount application and line item management, particularly involving functions like `modifyQty`, `deleteItem`, and `handleReAddItem`.  The core functionality of managing order details remains consistent throughout the revisions.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx` file was modified between 10:22:42 and 11:32:50 on February 2, 2025.  These changes involved improvements to the UI rendering based on the `couponsData` prop.  Initially, there was a hardcoded array of discounts. This was later updated to dynamically render a discount section, showing coupon codes and descriptions from the `couponsData?.couponList` prop. A significant change was incorporating error handling: if `couponsData?.couponList` was empty or contained fewer than 5 items, it displayed skeleton loaders instead of rendering empty columns.  The conditional rendering based on `couponScreen` and `activeTab` state suggests a tabbed interface for UI customization.  The file uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library extensively.


## 12:03:49
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`, a React component for a rich text editor.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions:  providing buttons for bold, italic, underline, and link functionalities, along with a character counter (limiting input to 64 characters).

The most significant changes occur between the first and second revisions (11:28:26 and 11:29:40).  The second revision adds `{selectedValue}` to the `<div id='editor'>` element, likely to pre-populate the editor with existing text.

Subsequent revisions (11:30:35, 11:30:56, and 11:32:46)  remove this pre-populated text `{selectedValue}` from the `<div id='editor'>` element,  returning it to an empty state, suggesting an iterative process of adding and then removing this feature. There are no other functional changes in subsequent commits.  The code remains largely unchanged apart from this modification.  The overall structure, event handlers (`handleFormatting`, `handleInputChange`, `handleLinkSubmit`, `handleCancel`), and internal state management remain identical across all versions.


## 13:03:57
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`, both occurring on March 2nd, 2025.  The changes between the two revisions are minimal.  Both revisions contain a significant amount of JavaScript code responsible for integrating a "Gokwik" payment system. This code handles initialization, payment processing via `window.postMessage`, event management, and cookie manipulation for tracking landing pages and referrer URLs.

The `merchantInfo` object contains numerous commented-out `mid` values, suggesting testing across various environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  The active `mid` value is 'gh0yshvkmca4pw4'.  The code also includes commented-out code for loading a gokwik script and loads an analytics script that listens for a custom event ("dog").  There's also a button with the id `gokwik-button`, which is the primary trigger for the checkout process.  The file also contains code for a Privy widget, a marketing tool which is unrelated to the Gokwik integration.

The timestamp difference between the two revisions is only 23 seconds, indicating a very minor and likely inconsequential edit.  The nature of the edit is not apparent from the provided diffs, as the content appears identical except for possibly some whitespace changes.

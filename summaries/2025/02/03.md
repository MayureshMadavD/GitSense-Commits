The log shows modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 20:52:19 and 21:08:32 on January 31, 2025.  These revisions appear to be incremental changes, with no substantial structural alterations to the code. The changes primarily focus on refining the component's handling of discount application and line item management, particularly involving functions like `modifyQty`, `deleteItem`, and `handleReAddItem`.  The core functionality of managing order details remains consistent throughout the revisions.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx` file was modified between 10:22:42 and 11:32:50 on February 2, 2025.  These changes involved improvements to the UI rendering based on the `couponsData` prop.  Initially, there was a hardcoded array of discounts. This was later updated to dynamically render a discount section, showing coupon codes and descriptions from the `couponsData?.couponList` prop. A significant change was incorporating error handling: if `couponsData?.couponList` was empty or contained fewer than 5 items, it displayed skeleton loaders instead of rendering empty columns.  The conditional rendering based on `couponScreen` and `activeTab` state suggests a tabbed interface for UI customization.  The file uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library extensively.

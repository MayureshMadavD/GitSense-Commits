The log shows modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 20:52:19 and 21:08:32 on January 31, 2025.  These revisions appear to be incremental changes, with no substantial structural alterations to the code. The changes primarily focus on refining the component's handling of discount application and line item management, particularly involving functions like `modifyQty`, `deleteItem`, and `handleReAddItem`.  The core functionality of managing order details remains consistent throughout the revisions.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx` file was modified between 10:22:42 and 11:32:50 on February 2, 2025.  These changes involved improvements to the UI rendering based on the `couponsData` prop.  Initially, there was a hardcoded array of discounts. This was later updated to dynamically render a discount section, showing coupon codes and descriptions from the `couponsData?.couponList` prop. A significant change was incorporating error handling: if `couponsData?.couponList` was empty or contained fewer than 5 items, it displayed skeleton loaders instead of rendering empty columns.  The conditional rendering based on `couponScreen` and `activeTab` state suggests a tabbed interface for UI customization.  The file uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library extensively.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`, a React component for a rich text editor.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions:  providing buttons for bold, italic, underline, and link functionalities, along with a character counter (limiting input to 64 characters).

The most significant changes occur between the first and second revisions (11:28:26 and 11:29:40).  The second revision adds `{selectedValue}` to the `<div id='editor'>` element, likely to pre-populate the editor with existing text.

Subsequent revisions (11:30:35, 11:30:56, and 11:32:46)  remove this pre-populated text `{selectedValue}` from the `<div id='editor'>` element,  returning it to an empty state, suggesting an iterative process of adding and then removing this feature. There are no other functional changes in subsequent commits.  The code remains largely unchanged apart from this modification.  The overall structure, event handlers (`handleFormatting`, `handleInputChange`, `handleLinkSubmit`, `handleCancel`), and internal state management remain identical across all versions.

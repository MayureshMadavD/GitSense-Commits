# Activity Summary for 20/02/2025

## 12:43:52
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**  undergoes several revisions between 22:30:18 and 23:13:40.  These revisions primarily involve the `window.merchantInfo` object within the `<script>` tags. This object is used to pass merchant information (like `mid`, `environment`, `storeId`, and `fbpixel`) which seems to change across different revisions suggesting the testing of various configurations for different environments (qa, sandbox, production etc.).  The  commented-out sections remain unchanged throughout the revisions.  There is no significant change in the HTML structure across these revisions.  The commented-out analytics script remains consistently commented out.  Cookie handling functions (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) are added and remain the same across all revisions to store landing page and referrer information.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`** is modified at 22:30:35, 22:30:47, 23:13:59.  The file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API, Cred, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, analytics) based on the environment (`env`). The `env` variable is obtained from a store (`store_environment`)  and the logic to determine the appropriate URL for each service based on the environment remains consistent across all revisions.  The most notable change across revisions is within the `setCart()` function.  The `store_cartjsObject` is updated with different cart data (token, items, prices etc.) in each revision. This strongly suggests that the changes involve testing with different cart details or orders in different environments.  There appears to be a change from a commented-out section from `setCart()` to the final, updated function across these revisions.  The use of `https://api.gokwik.co` as the default `api_url` for the `local` environment is the major structural change in the last revision of this file.

# Activity Summary for 21/02/2025

## 10:35:51
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file.  All revisions at different timestamps show almost identical code. The code implements a React component for editing order details.  It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and interacts with Redux for state management. The component includes features for managing line items (adding, deleting, modifying quantities), applying discounts (with validation for title and value), and handling a "recently deleted" list of items.  The code extensively uses functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`), and the `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Table`, `Button`, `Modal`, etc., to create the user interface.  There's no significant functional change across all the timestamps, only minor, likely inconsequential differences in whitespace or formatting. The timestamps indicate that multiple edits were made within a short period between 10:18:36 and 10:33:56 AM on February 21, 2025.


## 11:34:30
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` between 11:31:23 and 11:32:06 on 21/02/2025.  The changes across all revisions appear to be minor and inconsequential, with no substantive alterations to the code's functionality.  The code implements a React component for editing orders, featuring a table for line items, discount management (including adding, removing, and applying discounts), and functionality to delete and re-add items.  The component uses various UI components from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and interacts with Redux for state management.  The repeated code snippets suggest that no functional changes were introduced in the multiple commits within this timeframe.


## 12:34:29
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` was updated on 21/02/2025 at 12:30:34.  This React component handles editing order details.  Significant changes include the addition of extensive state management for order line items, discounts (including fixed amount and percentage discounts,  the ability to add, remove and re-add items, and tracking recently deleted items), and address information. The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and integrates with Redux for state management and API calls via `makeAPICall`.  The code implements features such as:

* **Line Item Management:**  Adding, removing, and modifying quantities of line items in an order.  The UI includes buttons to increment/decrement quantities and delete items.  Deleted items are moved to a "recently deleted" section allowing for re-addition.

* **Discount Management:** Applying fixed amount or percentage discounts to the order. A modal handles discount input and application. The UI updates dynamically to reflect applied discounts and their impact on the total.

* **UI Interactions:** The component includes a table to display order items, modals for confirmations (like item deletion), and a drawer (indicated by `isDrawerOpen` state).

* **Data Handling:** Uses multiple `useState` hooks to manage various aspects of the order editing process, including error handling (`editError`, `errorItems`).  The component fetches data, likely order details, from an API (`APIEndPoints`) and updates the breadcrumbs (`updateBreadcrumbs`).

The code heavily uses functional components, hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useState`), and various UI components from the `gokwik-ui-kit`. The `calculateGrandTotal` function calculates the final price after applying discounts.  The `handleReAddItem` function handles re-adding items from the recently deleted items list.  The logic is complex, involving numerous state variables and conditional rendering to manage various states (e.g., enabling/disabling buttons based on input validity, handling discount application, and displaying appropriate UI elements).


## 14:27:38
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` between 13:27:30 and 14:16:02 on February 21, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` file also underwent numerous revisions during this period (13:44:38 to 14:27:19).

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`:** This file, the main application file, primarily receives updates related to handling incoming messages (`window.addEventListener('message'`) and processing launch data.  These updates consistently focus on setting various store values based on the received data. The cart object handling, specifically how it's received and validated, is modified in multiple commits.  There are no major structural changes, only incremental modifications to the event handling and data processing logic.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`:** This file defines functions that retrieve base URLs for different services based on the environment (`env`). The most significant change here is the addition of various environment-specific URLs for  `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path` and `analytics_api`, indicating the addition of new environments or services.  There's also a consistent pattern of using `if` statements to handle various environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, and local). A `setCart()` function is also added and appears to handle setting a pre-populated cart object based on the environment.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`:**  This component handling address inputs undergoes significant evolution.  The major changes involve the conditional rendering and modification of input fields (`addressInputs`) based on different address layouts (`$store_newAddressLayout`, `$store_additionalAddress`), specifically handling the inclusion or exclusion of recipient phone numbers and apartment names. The logic for handling Kwikpass login email also changes significantly in multiple commits.  The `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties of email inputs are adjusted in multiple commits based on whether the `store_kpEmail` is populated and a `isKpEmailEditConfig` flag.  The changes demonstrate a refactoring effort to improve the flexibility and adaptability of the address input form.  The addition of `useKiwkpassLogin` reactive declaration simplifies the code.

In summary, the codebase is experiencing iterative development focused on enhancing its handling of various environments, refining the user interface (particularly for address input), improving event handling mechanisms and data processing for the checkout process. The frequent updates to `App.svelte` suggest a focus on integrating and managing data flow from the merchantâ€™s website into the Gokwik checkout system.


## 15:31:06
The log shows significant updates to two Svelte components: `AddressInputs.svelte` and `App.svelte`, both on February 21st, 2025.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` (14:28:15):** This file underwent a major revision, primarily focusing on address input management.  The code introduces three variations of address input fields (`oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, `suggestedAddressInputs`), each tailored for different address entry flows (existing address, new address, and suggested address). The conditional logic dynamically adds a "Recipient Phone Number" field based on `$store_enableRecipientPhone` and an "Apartment, Suite, etc" field based on `addressMMIFlow`. The component uses numerous stores from `LoginStore` and `CommonStore` to manage state and interact with other parts of the application.  It also utilizes helper functions for tasks like phone number validation and analytics events firing.  The `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` lifecycle hooks are used to manage the rendering of the address input fields based on store values.  The reactive declaration `$: useKiwkpassLogin = !!$store_kpEmail && isKpEmailEditConfig;` shows dynamic updates based on Kwikpass email.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` (14:29:27):** This file, the main application component, shows updates related to checkout flow management.  It imports and utilizes a vast number of stores, indicating a complex application state.  The `onMount` lifecycle hook handles various initialization tasks, including setting up browser history event listeners to manage back button behavior and receiving message events (`gokwikEvent`) that seem to contain important initialization data (including merchant information, cart details, and environment specifics). The component incorporates many different Svelte components, suggesting a modular design for the checkout process (address input, payment options, snackbars, etc).  The component handles multiple checkout scenarios, including handling of abandoned carts and different payment methods, with extensive error handling and logging of events for analytics purposes.  The code demonstrates robust error handling (`APIErrorHandling`) and many integration points with external services and APIs.  The component determines the view properties (mobile or desktop) based on the `parentWidth`.  The conditional logic with `isAbandonCart` suggests that this component manages the handling of abandoned shopping carts.

The overall pattern in both files reveals a complex checkout flow heavily reliant on reactive state management using Svelte stores and numerous helper functions and services.  The close proximity of the timestamps suggests these changes are related to a coordinated update to the checkout UI.


## 16:33:02
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` between 16:05:50 and 16:30:26 on February 21, 2025.  The file is a Svelte component dealing with address inputs in a checkout UI.  The primary changes revolve around handling Kwikpass email login configuration.  Initially, the component had a `useKiwkpassLogin` variable controlled by `$store_kpEmail` and `isKpEmailEditConfig`.  Later revisions simplified this logic, directly using `!$store_kpEmail` to control email input's `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties, effectively enabling or disabling email editing based on Kwikpass login status.  There were also minor adjustments made throughout these edits, but the core modification remained consistent across multiple commits within this timeframe.  The `oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, and `suggestedAddressInputs` arrays are consistently updated to reflect the changes in email field editability.  The addition of recipient phone number and apartment fields are also consistently applied across all three arrays whenever `$store_enableRecipientPhone` or `addressMMIFlow` is true.


## 16:34:30
This commit on `21/02/2025, 15:52:23` modifies `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`.  The change involves a significant update to a React component responsible for editing order details.  The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements and interacts with an API (`makeAPICall`) and Redux store (`useSelector`).

Key updates include:

* **Enhanced Order Item Management:** The component now allows adding, removing, and modifying quantities of order items.  This is facilitated through a table with actions for adding/subtracting quantities and deleting items.  A feature to restore recently deleted items is also present.

* **Discount Functionality:**  A robust discount system is implemented, allowing users to apply fixed amount or percentage discounts with a title.  The UI updates to reflect discounts applied and provides feedback to the user.  The system handles cases where discounts exceed item totals.

* **State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` hooks manages the component's state, including line items, modal states, error handling, discount information (type, value, applied status), and address data.  A custom `updateState` function simplifies updating the discount-related state.

* **Data Handling:** The code processes order data, calculates grand totals considering discounts, and renders the data in a table format.  It handles various scenarios, including empty line items and identical item comparisons.  Data is fetched, likely from an API,  and presented via columns with features like image rendering and formatted amounts.

* **Error Handling:** The component includes error handling mechanisms, showing messages to the user upon errors like missing discount information or already existing products.

* **Navigation:**  The component utilizes `useLocation` and `useNavigate` (or `navigateToUrl` from `single-spa`) for routing.

In summary, this commit implements a complex React component for editing orders with comprehensive features for managing line items, applying discounts, and handling various edge cases. The code is well-structured but potentially could benefit from further refactoring for improved readability and maintainability, particularly in the discount logic.


## 17:31:11
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` between 16:34:58 and 17:27:44 on February 21, 2025.  The core functionality of the component, which handles address input fields in a checkout UI, remains consistent throughout.  The primary changes revolve around the handling of email address fields based on whether the user is logged in with KwikPass.


The initial versions (16:34:58 - 16:38:03) define three sets of address input fields (`oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, `suggestedAddressInputs`) and conditionally renders them based on various store values like `$store_newAddressLayout` and `$store_additionalAddress`.  The `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties of the email field are initially determined by `$store_kpEmail`.

Between 16:38:47 and 16:53:30, the logic for determining email field accessibility is refined.  The `isKwikPassLogin` variable is introduced, computed from `$store_kpEmail` and `isKpEmailEditConfig`.  The `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties of the email field are modified based on the value of `isKwikPassLogin`.  Several `console.log` statements are added for debugging purposes.

At 17:00:57, the code is cleaned up, with the computation of `isKwikPassLogin` moved into the reactive declaration (`$:`), and `emailDisabled` is set based on `isKwikPassLogin`.  Also `addressFields['email']` is set to `$store_kpEmail`.

Subsequent changes (17:03:07 - 17:17:54) primarily focus on refining the conditional logic governing the `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties of the email field.  The condition is changed to `!(store_kpEmail && isKpEmailEditConfig)`, using the `store_kpEmail` directly instead of `isKwikPassLogin`. The `readOnly` property is consistently updated to `!!$store_kpEmail && isKpEmailEditConfig`.

Finally, at 17:27:44, `isKpEmailEditConfig` is dynamically determined based on the presence of `"kp_email_update_config"` within the `$store_requestIdObject?.custom_config` object. This final revision suggests a more flexible and data-driven approach to configuring the email field's behavior.  The overall pattern is one of iterative refinement of the conditional logic for managing email address input based on KwikPass login status, reflecting a process of debugging and enhancement.


## 18:31:15
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` file between 17:43:37 and 18:11:37 on February 21, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout: managing address input fields within a Svelte component.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the handling of email field read-only and `changeAllowed` properties based on a `KwikPassLogin` flag.

The initial revisions (17:43:37 - 17:46:30) focus on conditional rendering of address input fields based on various store values (`$store_enableRecipientPhone`, `addressMMIFlow`, `$store_additionalAddress`, `$store_newAddressLayout`).  There are three distinct address input layouts: `oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, and `suggestedAddressInputs`.  The `isKwikPassLogin` variable controls the email input's read-only state.  The initial implementation of this flag is flawed.

Between 17:48:51 and 18:11:37, the code undergoes significant restructuring, simplifying the logic for determining the `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties of the email field. The `isKwikPassLogin` flag's calculation is improved. The original conditional logic involving `isKwikPassLogin` in multiple locations is replaced by directly using `!$store_kpEmail` for controlling the email field.  This greatly reduces code redundancy.

Debugging statements (`console.log`) were added and removed multiple times during the process, reflecting the iterative debugging approach taken by the developer. The final version uses a more concise reactive declaration (`$:`) to manage `isKwikPassLogin`, making the code cleaner and more readable.  The logic to determine `isKwikPassLogin` is refactored to be clearer.  Finally, the `readOnly` property for the email input consistently reflects the `!!$store_kpEmail` value, correcting a previous inconsistency.


## 20:12:44
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` file between 18:32 and 19:13 on February 21, 2025, and  `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file at 19:13 on February 21, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` file underwent numerous revisions focusing primarily on refining the logic for handling address input fields, specifically concerning email address behavior based on `$store_kpEmail` and a configuration flag (`$store_requestIdObject?.custom_config?.kp_email_update_config`).  The `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties of the email input field are repeatedly adjusted across these revisions.  The changes made between 18:51 and 18:59 consistently tweaked the conditional logic governing email input field behavior, based on different combinations of these variables. There are several `console.log` statements added and removed throughout the edits for debugging purposes.  Finally, a final, cleaner version of the conditional logic was committed at 19:13. The App.svelte file shows changes related to handling of various events and data from the checkout flow.  There are many stores used for managing various states such as cart, payment options and user data.  The changes made here seem to be related to optimizing the data handling and workflow in the application.


## 21:12:42
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` file and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` file between 20:16:39 and 20:35:29 on February 21, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the address input component and the merchant integration component's logic.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`:

Multiple revisions were made to this Svelte component, mostly involving adjustments to the handling of KwikPass logins (`$store_kpEmail`), conditional rendering of address fields (based on `$store_newAddressLayout` and `$store_additionalAddress`), and updates to how email field read-only status is determined based on KwikPass login configuration (`isKpEmailEditConfig`).  The `isKwikPassLogin` variable was repeatedly refined, with its calculation becoming more concise throughout the revisions.  The logic for handling recipient phone numbers and apartment information also underwent several iterations.  A significant change around 20:20:39 removed the `iskpEmailConfig` and `kpEmailConfig` variables, simplifying the configuration handling.  Further changes simplified the condition for `isKpEmailEditConfig` and refined logging statements.  By 20:35:29, the code stabilizes with a cleaner approach to determining `isKwikPassLogin`.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`:

This file, related to merchant integration, was updated once at 20:38:22. This revision involves setting up and handling various analytics integrations (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, Customer Labs, and Shopify Analytics).  It also includes logic for handling different environments (development, production, etc.), cookie management, and checking merchant health (`checkMerchantHealth`). The component manages KwikPass login information (`kpEmail`, `kpPhoneNumber`), and handles various query parameters.  The code also demonstrates prefetch tag management and error handling.


Recurring patterns observed across the AddressInputs.svelte file revisions include the repeated modification and refinement of conditional logic related to the display and behavior of address fields, specifically for the email address based on KwikPass configuration and conditional rendering of address fields based on different layout types.  The modifications suggest an iterative debugging and improvement process.

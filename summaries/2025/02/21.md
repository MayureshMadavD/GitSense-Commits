# Activity Summary for 21/02/2025

## 10:35:51
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file.  All revisions at different timestamps show almost identical code. The code implements a React component for editing order details.  It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and interacts with Redux for state management. The component includes features for managing line items (adding, deleting, modifying quantities), applying discounts (with validation for title and value), and handling a "recently deleted" list of items.  The code extensively uses functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`), and the `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Table`, `Button`, `Modal`, etc., to create the user interface.  There's no significant functional change across all the timestamps, only minor, likely inconsequential differences in whitespace or formatting. The timestamps indicate that multiple edits were made within a short period between 10:18:36 and 10:33:56 AM on February 21, 2025.


## 11:34:30
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` between 11:31:23 and 11:32:06 on 21/02/2025.  The changes across all revisions appear to be minor and inconsequential, with no substantive alterations to the code's functionality.  The code implements a React component for editing orders, featuring a table for line items, discount management (including adding, removing, and applying discounts), and functionality to delete and re-add items.  The component uses various UI components from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and interacts with Redux for state management.  The repeated code snippets suggest that no functional changes were introduced in the multiple commits within this timeframe.


## 12:34:29
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` was updated on 21/02/2025 at 12:30:34.  This React component handles editing order details.  Significant changes include the addition of extensive state management for order line items, discounts (including fixed amount and percentage discounts,  the ability to add, remove and re-add items, and tracking recently deleted items), and address information. The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and integrates with Redux for state management and API calls via `makeAPICall`.  The code implements features such as:

* **Line Item Management:**  Adding, removing, and modifying quantities of line items in an order.  The UI includes buttons to increment/decrement quantities and delete items.  Deleted items are moved to a "recently deleted" section allowing for re-addition.

* **Discount Management:** Applying fixed amount or percentage discounts to the order. A modal handles discount input and application. The UI updates dynamically to reflect applied discounts and their impact on the total.

* **UI Interactions:** The component includes a table to display order items, modals for confirmations (like item deletion), and a drawer (indicated by `isDrawerOpen` state).

* **Data Handling:** Uses multiple `useState` hooks to manage various aspects of the order editing process, including error handling (`editError`, `errorItems`).  The component fetches data, likely order details, from an API (`APIEndPoints`) and updates the breadcrumbs (`updateBreadcrumbs`).

The code heavily uses functional components, hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useState`), and various UI components from the `gokwik-ui-kit`. The `calculateGrandTotal` function calculates the final price after applying discounts.  The `handleReAddItem` function handles re-adding items from the recently deleted items list.  The logic is complex, involving numerous state variables and conditional rendering to manage various states (e.g., enabling/disabling buttons based on input validity, handling discount application, and displaying appropriate UI elements).


## 14:27:38
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` between 13:27:30 and 14:16:02 on February 21, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` file also underwent numerous revisions during this period (13:44:38 to 14:27:19).

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`:** This file, the main application file, primarily receives updates related to handling incoming messages (`window.addEventListener('message'`) and processing launch data.  These updates consistently focus on setting various store values based on the received data. The cart object handling, specifically how it's received and validated, is modified in multiple commits.  There are no major structural changes, only incremental modifications to the event handling and data processing logic.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`:** This file defines functions that retrieve base URLs for different services based on the environment (`env`). The most significant change here is the addition of various environment-specific URLs for  `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path` and `analytics_api`, indicating the addition of new environments or services.  There's also a consistent pattern of using `if` statements to handle various environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, and local). A `setCart()` function is also added and appears to handle setting a pre-populated cart object based on the environment.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`:**  This component handling address inputs undergoes significant evolution.  The major changes involve the conditional rendering and modification of input fields (`addressInputs`) based on different address layouts (`$store_newAddressLayout`, `$store_additionalAddress`), specifically handling the inclusion or exclusion of recipient phone numbers and apartment names. The logic for handling Kwikpass login email also changes significantly in multiple commits.  The `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties of email inputs are adjusted in multiple commits based on whether the `store_kpEmail` is populated and a `isKpEmailEditConfig` flag.  The changes demonstrate a refactoring effort to improve the flexibility and adaptability of the address input form.  The addition of `useKiwkpassLogin` reactive declaration simplifies the code.

In summary, the codebase is experiencing iterative development focused on enhancing its handling of various environments, refining the user interface (particularly for address input), improving event handling mechanisms and data processing for the checkout process. The frequent updates to `App.svelte` suggest a focus on integrating and managing data flow from the merchantâ€™s website into the Gokwik checkout system.


## 15:31:06
The log shows significant updates to two Svelte components: `AddressInputs.svelte` and `App.svelte`, both on February 21st, 2025.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` (14:28:15):** This file underwent a major revision, primarily focusing on address input management.  The code introduces three variations of address input fields (`oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, `suggestedAddressInputs`), each tailored for different address entry flows (existing address, new address, and suggested address). The conditional logic dynamically adds a "Recipient Phone Number" field based on `$store_enableRecipientPhone` and an "Apartment, Suite, etc" field based on `addressMMIFlow`. The component uses numerous stores from `LoginStore` and `CommonStore` to manage state and interact with other parts of the application.  It also utilizes helper functions for tasks like phone number validation and analytics events firing.  The `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` lifecycle hooks are used to manage the rendering of the address input fields based on store values.  The reactive declaration `$: useKiwkpassLogin = !!$store_kpEmail && isKpEmailEditConfig;` shows dynamic updates based on Kwikpass email.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` (14:29:27):** This file, the main application component, shows updates related to checkout flow management.  It imports and utilizes a vast number of stores, indicating a complex application state.  The `onMount` lifecycle hook handles various initialization tasks, including setting up browser history event listeners to manage back button behavior and receiving message events (`gokwikEvent`) that seem to contain important initialization data (including merchant information, cart details, and environment specifics). The component incorporates many different Svelte components, suggesting a modular design for the checkout process (address input, payment options, snackbars, etc).  The component handles multiple checkout scenarios, including handling of abandoned carts and different payment methods, with extensive error handling and logging of events for analytics purposes.  The code demonstrates robust error handling (`APIErrorHandling`) and many integration points with external services and APIs.  The component determines the view properties (mobile or desktop) based on the `parentWidth`.  The conditional logic with `isAbandonCart` suggests that this component manages the handling of abandoned shopping carts.

The overall pattern in both files reveals a complex checkout flow heavily reliant on reactive state management using Svelte stores and numerous helper functions and services.  The close proximity of the timestamps suggests these changes are related to a coordinated update to the checkout UI.


## 16:33:02
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` between 16:05:50 and 16:30:26 on February 21, 2025.  The file is a Svelte component dealing with address inputs in a checkout UI.  The primary changes revolve around handling Kwikpass email login configuration.  Initially, the component had a `useKiwkpassLogin` variable controlled by `$store_kpEmail` and `isKpEmailEditConfig`.  Later revisions simplified this logic, directly using `!$store_kpEmail` to control email input's `changeAllowed` and `readOnly` properties, effectively enabling or disabling email editing based on Kwikpass login status.  There were also minor adjustments made throughout these edits, but the core modification remained consistent across multiple commits within this timeframe.  The `oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, and `suggestedAddressInputs` arrays are consistently updated to reflect the changes in email field editability.  The addition of recipient phone number and apartment fields are also consistently applied across all three arrays whenever `$store_enableRecipientPhone` or `addressMMIFlow` is true.

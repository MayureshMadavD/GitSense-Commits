# Activity Summary for 21/02/2025

## 10:35:51
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file.  All revisions at different timestamps show almost identical code. The code implements a React component for editing order details.  It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and interacts with Redux for state management. The component includes features for managing line items (adding, deleting, modifying quantities), applying discounts (with validation for title and value), and handling a "recently deleted" list of items.  The code extensively uses functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`), and the `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Table`, `Button`, `Modal`, etc., to create the user interface.  There's no significant functional change across all the timestamps, only minor, likely inconsequential differences in whitespace or formatting. The timestamps indicate that multiple edits were made within a short period between 10:18:36 and 10:33:56 AM on February 21, 2025.

# Activity Summary for 24/02/2025

The provided log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`.  Both files were heavily modified between 23/02/2025, 23:44:47 and 24/02/2025, 00:09:09.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` primarily handles the checkout UI logic.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative development and debugging. The code heavily relies on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state, indicating a reactive architecture.  These stores manage data related to user login, addresses, order details, payment options, and various flags for UI elements and features (e.g., discount banners, loading screens). There's substantial interaction with various services (e.g., `MerchantAPI`, `EventService`, `Experiment.service`), showcasing integration with backend systems for data fetching and event tracking. The code includes handling of messages from iframes (`window.addEventListener('message'`) which suggests a complex integration workflow.  The frequent changes in this file point to ongoing development and refinement of checkout processes and features.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` manages environment-specific configurations.  The file was repeatedly updated,  primarily altering the URLs used for different environments (development, QA, sandbox, production).  The `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `analytics_api`, and other functions define different endpoints based on the `env` variable, which is obtained from the `LoginStore`. Multiple API endpoints for various services are defined and selected based on the current environment.  The repeated revisions indicate adjustments to API endpoints across multiple environments, potentially due to deployment changes or API updates. The changes in `setCart()` function within this file show the cart object being updated multiple times with varying numbers of items (22, 12, 5) and total prices (972800, 970800, 404500), suggesting testing or development of different scenarios. The consistent use of `'https://qa-core-api.dev.gokwik.in'` in the `local` environment setting within `api_url` might be a bug or a temporary setup for local testing.

# Activity Summary for 24/02/2025

## 02:10:47
The provided log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`.  Both files were heavily modified between 23/02/2025, 23:44:47 and 24/02/2025, 00:09:09.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` primarily handles the checkout UI logic.  The numerous revisions suggest iterative development and debugging. The code heavily relies on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state, indicating a reactive architecture.  These stores manage data related to user login, addresses, order details, payment options, and various flags for UI elements and features (e.g., discount banners, loading screens). There's substantial interaction with various services (e.g., `MerchantAPI`, `EventService`, `Experiment.service`), showcasing integration with backend systems for data fetching and event tracking. The code includes handling of messages from iframes (`window.addEventListener('message'`) which suggests a complex integration workflow.  The frequent changes in this file point to ongoing development and refinement of checkout processes and features.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` manages environment-specific configurations.  The file was repeatedly updated,  primarily altering the URLs used for different environments (development, QA, sandbox, production).  The `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `analytics_api`, and other functions define different endpoints based on the `env` variable, which is obtained from the `LoginStore`. Multiple API endpoints for various services are defined and selected based on the current environment.  The repeated revisions indicate adjustments to API endpoints across multiple environments, potentially due to deployment changes or API updates. The changes in `setCart()` function within this file show the cart object being updated multiple times with varying numbers of items (22, 12, 5) and total prices (972800, 970800, 404500), suggesting testing or development of different scenarios. The consistent use of `'https://qa-core-api.dev.gokwik.in'` in the `local` environment setting within `api_url` might be a bug or a temporary setup for local testing.


## 11:11:37
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file was updated on 24/02/2025 at 10:49:39.  This update significantly revised the Svelte component's logic, primarily focusing on checkout functionality.

The changes involve extensive use of numerous Svelte stores (`store_...`) from `./common/stores/LoginStore` and `./common/stores/CommonStore` and `./common/stores/OrderStore`, managing various aspects of the checkout process, including user information, address, payment options, order details, and discounts.  The component imports numerous other Svelte components for UI elements like address input, snackbars, headers, and various payment options screens.


The `onMount` lifecycle hook handles browser history management, preventing accidental navigation away from the checkout flow.  It also listens for `message` events, presumably from an iframe, to receive launch data containing crucial information like:

* **Merchant Information:**  `store_merchantInfo`, `store_mid`, `store_merchanturl`.
* **User Data:**  `store_isAbandonCart`, `store_phoneNo`, potentially others.
* **Payment Information:** `store_paymentLink`, `store_upiPaymentOptionsAvailable`.
* **Cart Information:** `store_cartjsObject`, `store_cartId`.
* **Environment Details:** `store_environment`, `store_isGlanceEnvironment`, `store_gaCookies`.
* **Token information:** `store_soToken`, `store_kwikpassToken`, `XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`.

This launch data is then used to populate the various stores and initialize the checkout process.  Error handling (`APIErrorHandling`) is implemented to manage potential issues, and various services are called (`fetchShopifyCart`, `getRequestId`, `getAbandonCart`) to fetch necessary data from the backend.

The code includes logic to handle different payment methods (UPI, net banking, card payments, BNPL), various discount calculations and applications, and interactions with different third-party services, including Webengage and potentially Shopify, as evidenced by the presence of functions like `initTracking` and calls to a Shopify API.  There's significant logic to handle cart validation, including checks for empty carts,  and managing the state of the checkout process across various screens (`store_page`).  The code also includes significant experiment tracking using stores like `store_userExperiments`.  Finally, numerous helper functions (`setViewProperties`, `setCookie`, `getCookie`, `insertGtmScript`, `getSearchParams`) are used for various tasks.


## 12:11:47
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` files between 11:16:06 and 12:06:47 on February 24, 2025.  The `EnvironmentService.ts` file primarily manages API base URLs and tokens based on the environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  Several `api_url` variations exist, suggesting a complex API routing strategy. The `local` environment is initially set to use a sandbox URL for `api_url`, indicating a possible default fallback.  There are several minor updates throughout the file's log entries which appear to be code cleanup and formatting changes that do not significantly alter functionality.

The `merchant.html` file defines a `gokwikSdk` object that handles communication with the Gokwik SDK and includes merchant information (mid, appid, appsecret) hardcoded which should be handled securely in a different way.  It also incorporates cookie management for tracking landing page and referrer data.  The `window.merchantInfo` object contains various merchant identifiers (mids) commented out, possibly for testing different merchant configurations.  The commented-out analytics script suggests a potential shift to a different analytics platform.  No functional changes are visible in the log entries for this file beyond the initial log entry.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentButton.svelte` file undergoes several revisions between 11:25:20 and 11:28:37 on February 24, 2025.  These changes appear focused on refining the logic for handling payment button visibility and functionality, particularly concerning A/B testing variations for Snapmint and Bharatx button display.  The `shouldHideBnpl` function incorporates multiple experimental variants, impacting visibility based on risk level and UPI availability. A `console.log` statement is added at the end of one revision, possibly for debugging purposes.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/UpiCollect/UpiCollect.svelte` file is updated at 11:32:22. This file manages UPI collection payment flows and shows minor updates to the code functionality.

Finally, `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/OrderStore.ts` is updated at 11:53:57 and the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file is updated multiple times between 11:54:30 and 12:10:26 on February 24, 2025. These files contain extensive updates to the state management and event handling within the application. The `App.svelte` file handles the main application logic, including initialization, communication with the Gokwik SDK, and routing based on the application's state.  The updates in both files show extensive changes relating to various features,  including handling of different payment methods, order statuses, and discount application logic.  The `onMount` function in `App.svelte` demonstrates a significant portion of the applicationâ€™s setup, including handling of cart data, API calls for request IDs, discount application and other crucial initialization steps.  The addition and updates to store subscriptions indicate a highly reactive application architecture.  Several commented-out code sections and changes related to A/B testing are evident in this file's numerous revisions. The `Helper.service.ts` file receives updates at 12:04:24 and 12:06:47, focusing on utility functions for address management, bottom sheet handling, and other helper functionalities.  The `MobilePhoneInput.svelte` file is also updated at 12:06:57, managing the mobile phone input field and associated actions.

In summary, the changes show an iterative development process focusing on improving the checkout flow, enhancing its responsiveness to different environments and conditions, and refining data handling and store management. The updates are primarily focused on enhancing the user experience and the stability of the application.


## 14:11:44
The code changes span across several Svelte components and service files within a checkout UI application.  The primary focus appears to be on payment options and related UI elements.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Helper.service.ts` (24/02/2025, 13:11:55): This file contains various utility functions.  Significant changes include:  The addition of functions `setAddress`, `autofillEvents`, `closeBottomSheet`, `closeIframe`, `closeFullScreenPopUp`, `setCreateOrderStores`, `getBadgeTitle`, `resetAdoncPopoup`, `processNumber`, `setPartialAddress`, and `addPartialAddress`.  These functions manage state using Svelte stores, handle various UI interactions, make API calls (e.g., `addAddress`, `editAddress`, `getEddTime`, `updateCart`), and perform logging. The use of numerous imports from various store files suggests a complex state management system.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` (24/02/2025, 13:14:03 & 24/02/2025, 13:14:12): This file is the main application component.  It imports and uses many components, suggesting a modular design. The component heavily relies on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state.  The `onMount` lifecycle hook handles browser history management, event listeners for messages from an iframe, and initialization logic that includes fetching data based on `isAbandonCart` and performing various actions based on the `gokwikEvent`. This shows that the application interacts with iframes and uses various stores in its initialization.  There are repeated updates to many different stores, demonstrating intensive state management.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte` (24/02/2025, 13:15:36, 24/02/2025, 13:16:59, 24/02/2025, 13:17:36): This component implements a bottom sheet UI element.  The updates primarily involve enhancements to the UI rendering, particularly around payment status indicators (INITIATE, PENDING, SUCCESS, FAIL)  and the handling of different payment methods. There is also added handling for an offer banner and address count display.  The component uses subscriptions to multiple stores for managing its state and behavior. The changes across the multiple timestamps appear to be minor refinements and bug fixes related to UI presentation and handling various payment states. A notable change in the last update is simplification of the `type` variable comparison in the `class` attribute.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentButton.svelte` (24/02/2025, 13:19:37, 24/02/2025, 13:19:44, 24/02/2025, 13:20:37, 24/02/2025, 13:21:17, 24/02/2025, 13:22:01):  This component renders payment method buttons.  The multiple updates progressively refine the buttonâ€™s behavior and styling, notably adding handling for  two-step COD confirmation, freebies,  and  different UI states based on payment method types and screen sizes.  The use of `IntersectionObserver` for logging payment button impressions shows optimization for analytics tracking. The repeated updates show iterative improvements on conditional rendering based on multiple experiment flags and risk assessments.  The `shouldHideBnpl()` function is updated across the timestamps to include handling for various experiment variants.


## 15:11:36
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` was updated on 24/02/2025 at 14:47:33.  The update extensively modifies the order summary display, incorporating features like:

* **Dynamic Pricing Calculations:** The code heavily relies on numerous Svelte stores (`store_discountAmount`, `store_prepaidDiscount`, `store_codCharges`, etc.) to calculate the `totalPrice` dynamically. This calculation accounts for discounts (coupon, prepaid, reward-based), COD charges, shipping, GST, and gift cards,  handling various edge cases based on the current page and application state (e.g., `$store_page`, `customClass`).

* **Conditional Rendering:**  The UI adapts based on different states, including the `$store_isPPCOD` flag, the current page (`currentPage`), and the presence of free gifts (`giftAdded`). This leads to conditional rendering of elements like `PrepaidCodSteps`, various discount information displays, and shipping details.

* **Cart Item Display:**  The component iterates through `cartItems` to display individual product details, including price (with strikethrough for discounted items and MRP if applicable), quantity, and additional properties.  It also handles free products and applies styling based on conditions (`item?.is_product_free`).

* **Event Handling and Analytics:**  The component uses `onMount` and `onDestroy` lifecycle methods to manage subscriptions to various stores.  It also includes functions to fire Google Tag Manager and GA4 events (`fireGtmEvent`, `fireAnalyticsGa4`, `logEvent`) for tracking user interactions.

* **Store Management:**  A significant portion of the code manages subscriptions to numerous stores using `subscribe` and handles unsubscribing in `onDestroy`.  This suggests a reactive architecture using Svelte stores for data management.

* **UI Enhancements:**  Visual elements are updated based on the state of various stores. For example, the cart update message is shown conditionally (`isCartUpdated`).

The overall change represents a substantial update to the order summary component, enhancing its functionality, dynamic behavior, and integration with analytics and data management systems.  The extensive use of conditional rendering and reactive data updates indicates a complex and robust component designed to handle various checkout scenarios.


## 16:11:34
The log shows two edits to the `.gitignore` file within one minute (16:03:51 and 16:04:05 on 24/02/2025).  The changes are minimal. The second revision removes a forward slash before `src/main.css` in the list of project-specific files to ignore.  The rest of the `.gitignore` file content remains identical across both revisions, specifying which files and directories should be excluded from version control.  This includes log files, build artifacts, dependency directories (node_modules, bower_components), cache files, editor-specific files, and more.


## 17:11:41
The log shows a series of code changes to the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx` file and a new file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingerror.tsx`  and  `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file.

The `index.tsx` file underwent significant revisions between 16:17:34 and 16:41:16.  Initially, it contained a React component rendering a UI for managing shipping settings, including features like drag-and-drop reordering, adding/editing/deleting shipping methods, and displaying shipping method details.  The component fetched configuration data via an API call (`makeAPICall`) to an endpoint (`process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL + APIEndPoints.merchantConfigs`).  The UI utilized the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library. At 16:20:00 the entire UI was removed, leaving only the component definition. Between 16:25:04 and 16:34:39, it was simplified to a minimal `<div>` rendering "index" before being completely replaced multiple times. Finally, at 16:41:16, the component was rewritten to use a custom hook (`useMerchantConfigApi`) for fetching and saving merchant configuration, simplifying the data management.

The `shippingerror.tsx` file was created at 16:48:14, containing a simple component to display an error message. This suggests the addition of error handling within the shipping settings page.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was modified at 17:02:39, 17:04:29, 17:10:02 and 17:10:11. These changes involve updates to the import map, specifying the URLs for various Gokwik modules ("@gokwik/*") based on the environment (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  The production environment (`deployedEnv==='production'`) includes integration with Clarity.ms for analytics and New Relic for application performance monitoring, demonstrating a production-ready setup.  The `dev` environment URLs changed multiple times indicating changes in the deployment target for the different modules.


In summary, the log indicates iterative development of the shipping settings UI component (`index.tsx`), addition of error handling (`shippingerror.tsx`), and configuration of the dashboard's module loading and monitoring based on the environment (`index.ejs`).  There's a clear progression from a fully featured UI component to a simplified version and finally to a version that uses a custom hook for API interactions. The frequent changes to the `index.ejs` file's import map suggest ongoing adjustments to the deployment infrastructure.


## 18:11:41
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingerror.tsx` file between 17:14:42 and 17:37:21 on 24/02/2025.  These changes involved enhancing the UI component `NoShippingAvailableMesage`.

Initially, the component was simple, displaying only a `NoDataIcon`.  Subsequent edits added:

* **17:27:21:** A message "No Shipping Rules Are Setup Yet" was added below the icon.
* **17:29:21 - 17:29:35:** The structure was refactored to use two separate `Row` components for better layout.  `justify='center'` was consistently applied.
* **17:30:51 - 17:32:45:** A "Add New Shipping" button was introduced, with additional styling using `className='gap-y-3'` to control vertical spacing.
* **17:35:44:** The button's variant was set to `'primary'`.
* **17:36:36 - 17:37:21:**  The component was wrapped in a `<span>` and then a `<Card>` element to further improve the visual presentation.  There was some back and forth between `<span>` and `<Card>` wrapping.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx` file was updated at 17:15:03, incorporating the newly created `NoShippingAvailableMesage` component.  This suggests the creation of `shippingerror.tsx` was to handle the case of no shipping rules being configured.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file underwent multiple changes between 17:22:10 and 17:23:17.  These modifications involved updating the import map to specify different URLs for various modules (@gokwik/* packages) based on the `deployedEnv` variable (dev, qa, sandbox, production). This suggests a build process that dynamically adjusts module locations for different environments.  The inclusion of `clarityKey` conditional for production environment further confirms this.  The  `NREUM` (New Relic) related code suggests integration with New Relic application performance monitoring tools.  The code shows changes between 17:22:10 and 17:23:17 and then again between 17:22:30 and 17:23:17 implying that the file was edited twice within this short time period.  The exact nature of the changes is not clear without a detailed diff.


## 19:11:36
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentButton.svelte`.  The `EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated twice within a minute (18:59:18 and 18:59:39), indicating a quick iterative fix or configuration change. The changes appear to be related to URL configurations for different environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.). The `local` environment URL for `api_url` was changed from `'https://sandbox.gokwik.co'` to `'https://qa-core-api.dev.gokwik.in'` in the second update.  The file defines functions to dynamically determine API base URLs, CDN paths, and other URLs based on the current environment.  There is also logic to set up a sample cart object for local environments.

The `PaymentButton.svelte` file was updated twice, with a slightly longer gap between changes (19:02:34 and 19:03:38). This Svelte component manages the rendering and behavior of payment method buttons.  Significant changes involve the addition of A/B testing logic for Snapmint and Bharatx button visibility (controlled by `store_showSnapmintBasedOnRisk` and `store_showSnapmintBasedOnUPI`). The component also handles different scenarios for COD payments (including two-step verification and a slider), and includes comprehensive logging of button impressions and clicks using an `IntersectionObserver` or a manual scroll event listener. There are numerous stores used to manage the state of the payment options and UI, and the code extensively uses conditional rendering based on various store values and environment variables.  The updates seem to focus on refining the payment button behavior,  A/B test implementation, and error handling. No functional changes were observed in the two updates to this file.

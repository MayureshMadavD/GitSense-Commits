# Activity Summary for 13/02/2025

## 10:03:10
The log shows multiple updates to two Svelte components: `MobilePhoneInput.svelte` and `BottomSheet.svelte`.  The updates span from 22:34:01 to 23:21:26 on December 2nd, 2025, and continue on February 13th, 2025 at 01:44:10.  `EnvironmentService.ts` was also updated on February 13th, 2025 at 01:38:22.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/MobilePhoneInput.svelte`**: This file underwent a single major update on December 2nd, 2025.  The update involved significant changes to the `onMount` and `callPhoneAPI` functions.  These changes focus on handling phone number validation, submitting phone numbers via an API (`submitPhoneNumber`), updating cart information (`updateCart`), and managing various application states using Svelte stores (e.g., `store_phoneNo`, `store_disableContinueButton`, `store_GSTBilling`).  The code also includes extensive error handling and logging, as well as integration with analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, webengage).  There's substantial logic around handling different scenarios based on user input, and various stores are used to manage states such as discounts and payment methods.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte`**: This file experienced multiple updates between December 2nd, 2025 at 22:54:39 and December 2nd, 2025 at 23:21:26.  The modifications primarily focused on enhancing the visual presentation and functionality of a bottom sheet component used for displaying payment information, offer banners, and address count.  Specific changes include styling additions via SCSS (`<style lang="scss">`), refining the handling of payment statuses (INITIATE, PENDING, SUCCESS, FAIL) with animations, adding a shine effect to a map image, and handling the display of offer banners and address counts.  These updates improve the user experience during payment flow by providing clearer visual feedback and a more polished look.  The code also utilizes numerous Svelte stores (`store_bottomSheetState`, `store_paymentOfferBanner`, `store_addressCount` etc.) and functions for interacting with the payment gateway, displaying UI elements, and logging events.  A recurring theme is the use of conditional rendering based on payment status and current page, enhancing the dynamic nature of the bottom sheet's presentation.  The final updates improve the shine animation and map image presentation.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**:  This file, updated on February 13th, 2025, contains functions to determine base URLs for different services based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production).  It uses the `store_environment` to determine which URLs to use.  The code highlights different API endpoints for different environments and shows a pattern of using a prefix and suffix for dev and sandbox environments while having dedicated endpoints for production.  It also defines functions for getting Gokwik and Kwikpass tokens based on the environment.  The `setCart` function shows sample hardcoded cart data.


## 12:03:03
The provided log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` on February 13th, 2025.  All revisions involve updates to a Svelte component handling discounts in a checkout process. The core functionality remains consistent across all versions, focusing on managing discounts, coupons, and store credits.

The changes primarily involve additions to the `onMount` function within the `<script>` tag.  Specifically, the component subscribes to various stores (`store_requestIdObject`, `store_reapplyEr`, `store_discountBasedRewards`, `store_partnerAcquisitionOffer`, `store_offers`, `store_cartAutoDiscount`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, `store_discountAmount`, `store_recommendedCouponCode`, `store_discountResponse`, and `store_selectedAddress`) to manage and update the UI based on changes in these data sources.

Between 11:54:46 and 11:56:57, there are no observable changes in the code.  A significant change occurs between 11:56:57 and 12:02:09, with the addition of `hide_discount_on_login_step` to the `store_requestIdObject` subscription within the `onMount` function. This suggests a new feature to conditionally hide discounts depending on the login status.  The overall structure and core logic of the component remain largely the same throughout all revisions.  The component extensively uses asynchronous operations (`await`) for fetching and applying discounts, suggesting a reliance on external services. The code also incorporates extensive error handling and logging mechanisms via `snackbar_state` and `stabilityEvent`.


## 13:03:02
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated on 13/02/2025, 12:10:14.  This file defines functions that return URLs based on the current environment (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The code extensively uses conditional logic to determine the appropriate URL for various APIs (health service, address suggestion, general API calls, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, analytics, etc.) and CDN paths.  Different environments have distinct URLs, suggesting a multi-environment setup for development, testing, and production.  The `env` variable, sourced from the `LoginStore`, plays a central role in this logic.  The file also includes functions to retrieve merchant URLs and specific tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which also vary based on the environment. Notably, a `setCart` function is present, which sets a cart object into a store; this object contains detailed product information including images and pricing, suggesting a shopping cart context.  The `local` environment often uses different URLs, such as `http://localhost:8080` for the CDN path and `http://localhost:3000` (commented out, but potentially previous default) for the api_url, indicating local development capabilities.  There's a significant amount of hardcoded URLs, which might be a candidate for improvement through configuration management.


## 15:12:57
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` on February 13, 2025.  The key changes revolve around refining the handling of shipping discounts and related API calls.

The initial version at 14:43:05 and subsequent versions at 14:44:40 and 14:44:48, all within a short timeframe, indicate iterative debugging or refinement.  The core functionality—a `callShippingDiscountApi` function making API calls to fetch and process shipping discounts—remains consistent. However, there are minor adjustments in error handling and conditional logic within `setShippingOptions`. Specifically, the check for an empty array in `setShippingOptions` is improved from `shippingOptionsRecieved.length === 0 || shippingOptionsRecieved?.error` to `!shippingOptionsRecieved?.length` for better clarity and handling of potential errors.

The code heavily uses a MobX-like observable store pattern (`store_...` variables) to manage application state.  Many functions update various stores based on API responses, reflecting a reactive programming approach.  The code also includes various logging mechanisms (`logEvent`, `stabilityEvent`), analytics tracking (`couponAppliedSuccess`, `shopifyAnalyticsCouponAppliedSuccess`), and UI feedback (e.g., snackbar messages and confetti effects) based on the success or failure of discount application.  The logic manages different environments ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.), suggesting a system designed for various stages of development and deployment.  The numerous environment-specific URLs highlight a complex setup.  Finally, there are functions which handle gift cards, loyalty points, and other reward systems.


## 15:13:03
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders` directory, focusing on order details and order editing functionalities.

The changes between `14:12:58` and `15:10:53` primarily involve the `index.tsx` file within the `order-details` and `edit-orders` subdirectories.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/priceBreakups.tsx` (13/02/2025, 14:12:58): This file was updated to create React components (`DiscountBreakupsData`, `TaxBreakupData`, `ShippingBreakupData`, `GiftBreakupData`) for displaying order price breakups using a Popover component from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The components handle displaying discount, tax, shipping, and gift details in a tabular format.  An additional function, `findOrderFailureReason`, maps order failure reasons from various internal codes to user-friendly messages.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` (13/02/2025, 14:52:46):  This file underwent a significant update. It incorporates the newly created `priceBreakups` components.  The major changes revolve around fetching order details using `makeAPICall`, merging and processing refund data (`mergeRepeatedRefunds`), and displaying comprehensive order information, including status, price breakups, refunds, and customer details. The `keyInformation` memo uses the fetched data to create an array of key-value pairs of order information.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` (13/02/2025, 14:52:59 - 15:10:53):  This file experienced multiple revisions between  14:52:59 and 15:10:53. These revisions focused on enhancing the UI for editing order details.  The component now includes features for adding, deleting, and modifying line items in an order, along with a discount mechanism supporting both fixed amounts and percentage-based discounts.  The UI is built using the `gokwik-ui-kit` and incorporates multiple state variables to manage the various aspects of order editing, including line items, discounts, and addresses.  The `columns` variable dynamically generates columns for the line item table.  A substantial amount of the code handles the discount logic, including adding, removing, and applying discounts to individual items.  The addition of a `TextArea` component in later commits suggests an improvement to the order editing form.


A recurring pattern in the code is the consistent use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI components and  `makeAPICall` for API interactions. The repeated structure of the price breakup components suggests a design pattern of reusability and maintainability.  The multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` indicate iterative development and refinement of the order editing functionality.


## 16:12:56
The log shows code changes primarily focused on `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/ResendOtp.svelte`.

On February 13th, 2025, the `EnvironmentService.ts` file underwent a significant update at 15:14:20. This update involved adding numerous functions to determine base URLs for various APIs (health service, address suggestion, general API, credentials, experiments, Twidpay, KP API, CDN, and analytics) based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The logic extensively uses conditional statements to select the appropriate URL for each environment.  The code also includes functions to set up a cart and request ID for the 'local' environment, and to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that vary depending on the environment.  The update also includes functions to handle merchant URLs and analytics API v2.

The `ResendOtp.svelte` file was modified three times between 15:23:41 and 15:24:57. These minor updates were primarily related to the rendering of a Whatsapp OTP component within the UI and involved minor changes to the conditional rendering of elements in the user interface based on the `resendFlag` and `store_whatsappOTP` variables.  The core functionality of the component (handling OTP resend requests and displaying a countdown timer) remained unchanged across the three commits.  The updates made seem to be related to minor UI adjustments and code restructuring.  No significant functional changes were introduced.


## 16:12:58
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file between 15:42:33 and 16:12:09 on February 13, 2025.  The changes appear to be iterative refinements to a React component responsible for editing order details.  The code consistently involves managing a state for `lineItems` (order items), `discount` (discount application logic), and other order-related data.  There are no substantial structural changes; the modifications primarily concern the handling of discounts and the user interface elements for displaying and managing order line items, including adding, removing, and updating quantities.  The `shouldHideUI` function suggests conditional rendering based on discount application and existing line items.  The repeated timestamps indicate that the developer was making frequent, small changes to the component.  The core functionality related to displaying and manipulating order items remains unchanged throughout the revision history.


## 17:12:59
The log shows numerous updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` between 16:13:27 and 17:10:28 on February 13, 2025.  These updates appear to be iterative refinements of a React component responsible for editing order details. The component heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements and `@gokwik/utilities` for API calls and other helper functions.

The core functionality involves managing a table of `lineItems`, allowing users to modify quantities (with a delete/re-add mechanism), apply discounts, and handle potential errors.  The `discount` state variable is complex, managing various aspects of discount application, including recently deleted items and the type and value of the discount.  The code repeatedly updates the `discount` state using the `updateState` function.


No significant structural changes are observed across the commits; instead, the modifications seem focused on improving the logic for discount calculation and error handling within the existing structure.  The numerous commits suggest a debugging or iterative development process.  The final commit at 17:10:28 likely represents a stable version after a period of refinement.  There are no discernible patterns or recurring elements beyond the consistent use of the `gokwik` libraries and the focus on discount and quantity management.

# Activity Summary for 13/02/2025

## 10:03:10
The log shows multiple updates to two Svelte components: `MobilePhoneInput.svelte` and `BottomSheet.svelte`.  The updates span from 22:34:01 to 23:21:26 on December 2nd, 2025, and continue on February 13th, 2025 at 01:44:10.  `EnvironmentService.ts` was also updated on February 13th, 2025 at 01:38:22.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/MobilePhoneInput.svelte`**: This file underwent a single major update on December 2nd, 2025.  The update involved significant changes to the `onMount` and `callPhoneAPI` functions.  These changes focus on handling phone number validation, submitting phone numbers via an API (`submitPhoneNumber`), updating cart information (`updateCart`), and managing various application states using Svelte stores (e.g., `store_phoneNo`, `store_disableContinueButton`, `store_GSTBilling`).  The code also includes extensive error handling and logging, as well as integration with analytics services (e.g., Google Analytics, webengage).  There's substantial logic around handling different scenarios based on user input, and various stores are used to manage states such as discounts and payment methods.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte`**: This file experienced multiple updates between December 2nd, 2025 at 22:54:39 and December 2nd, 2025 at 23:21:26.  The modifications primarily focused on enhancing the visual presentation and functionality of a bottom sheet component used for displaying payment information, offer banners, and address count.  Specific changes include styling additions via SCSS (`<style lang="scss">`), refining the handling of payment statuses (INITIATE, PENDING, SUCCESS, FAIL) with animations, adding a shine effect to a map image, and handling the display of offer banners and address counts.  These updates improve the user experience during payment flow by providing clearer visual feedback and a more polished look.  The code also utilizes numerous Svelte stores (`store_bottomSheetState`, `store_paymentOfferBanner`, `store_addressCount` etc.) and functions for interacting with the payment gateway, displaying UI elements, and logging events.  A recurring theme is the use of conditional rendering based on payment status and current page, enhancing the dynamic nature of the bottom sheet's presentation.  The final updates improve the shine animation and map image presentation.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**:  This file, updated on February 13th, 2025, contains functions to determine base URLs for different services based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production).  It uses the `store_environment` to determine which URLs to use.  The code highlights different API endpoints for different environments and shows a pattern of using a prefix and suffix for dev and sandbox environments while having dedicated endpoints for production.  It also defines functions for getting Gokwik and Kwikpass tokens based on the environment.  The `setCart` function shows sample hardcoded cart data.

The provided log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` on February 13th, 2025.  All revisions involve updates to a Svelte component handling discounts in a checkout process. The core functionality remains consistent across all versions, focusing on managing discounts, coupons, and store credits.

The changes primarily involve additions to the `onMount` function within the `<script>` tag.  Specifically, the component subscribes to various stores (`store_requestIdObject`, `store_reapplyEr`, `store_discountBasedRewards`, `store_partnerAcquisitionOffer`, `store_offers`, `store_cartAutoDiscount`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, `store_discountAmount`, `store_recommendedCouponCode`, `store_discountResponse`, and `store_selectedAddress`) to manage and update the UI based on changes in these data sources.

Between 11:54:46 and 11:56:57, there are no observable changes in the code.  A significant change occurs between 11:56:57 and 12:02:09, with the addition of `hide_discount_on_login_step` to the `store_requestIdObject` subscription within the `onMount` function. This suggests a new feature to conditionally hide discounts depending on the login status.  The overall structure and core logic of the component remain largely the same throughout all revisions.  The component extensively uses asynchronous operations (`await`) for fetching and applying discounts, suggesting a reliance on external services. The code also incorporates extensive error handling and logging mechanisms via `snackbar_state` and `stabilityEvent`.


## 13:03:02
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated on 13/02/2025, 12:10:14.  This file defines functions that return URLs based on the current environment (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The code extensively uses conditional logic to determine the appropriate URL for various APIs (health service, address suggestion, general API calls, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, analytics, etc.) and CDN paths.  Different environments have distinct URLs, suggesting a multi-environment setup for development, testing, and production.  The `env` variable, sourced from the `LoginStore`, plays a central role in this logic.  The file also includes functions to retrieve merchant URLs and specific tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which also vary based on the environment. Notably, a `setCart` function is present, which sets a cart object into a store; this object contains detailed product information including images and pricing, suggesting a shopping cart context.  The `local` environment often uses different URLs, such as `http://localhost:8080` for the CDN path and `http://localhost:3000` (commented out, but potentially previous default) for the api_url, indicating local development capabilities.  There's a significant amount of hardcoded URLs, which might be a candidate for improvement through configuration management.


## 15:12:57
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` on February 13, 2025.  The key changes revolve around refining the handling of shipping discounts and related API calls.

The initial version at 14:43:05 and subsequent versions at 14:44:40 and 14:44:48, all within a short timeframe, indicate iterative debugging or refinement.  The core functionality—a `callShippingDiscountApi` function making API calls to fetch and process shipping discounts—remains consistent. However, there are minor adjustments in error handling and conditional logic within `setShippingOptions`. Specifically, the check for an empty array in `setShippingOptions` is improved from `shippingOptionsRecieved.length === 0 || shippingOptionsRecieved?.error` to `!shippingOptionsRecieved?.length` for better clarity and handling of potential errors.

The code heavily uses a MobX-like observable store pattern (`store_...` variables) to manage application state.  Many functions update various stores based on API responses, reflecting a reactive programming approach.  The code also includes various logging mechanisms (`logEvent`, `stabilityEvent`), analytics tracking (`couponAppliedSuccess`, `shopifyAnalyticsCouponAppliedSuccess`), and UI feedback (e.g., snackbar messages and confetti effects) based on the success or failure of discount application.  The logic manages different environments ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.), suggesting a system designed for various stages of development and deployment.  The numerous environment-specific URLs highlight a complex setup.  Finally, there are functions which handle gift cards, loyalty points, and other reward systems.

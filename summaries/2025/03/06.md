# Activity Summary for 06/03/2025

The code changes on June 3rd, 2025, involved updates to two files: `apiEndpoints.ts` and `interface.ts`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` file, updated at 15:41:01, contains a comprehensive list of API endpoints categorized by functionality.  These endpoints cover various operations, including order management (retrieval, creation, updates, and edits), address management (customer and agent orders), customer management, pincode management (retrieval, upload, download, and pre-signed URLs), merchant management, discount management (creation, retrieval, deletion, and updates), Shopify integration (customer, collection, and segment fetching), refund initiation, analytics (checkout funnel, order metrics, marketing metrics), and more.  The structure is largely organized around resources (e.g., `/api/dashboard/order`, `/api/dashboard/merchant`). Noteworthy is the extensive use of nested objects to categorize related endpoints, such as within `checkoutAnalytics` and `discountConfig`.  There's also significant usage of parameterized endpoints taking IDs or other identifiers.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` file, updated at 15:41:18, defines numerous TypeScript interfaces.  These interfaces appear to model various data structures used within the application,  including order details (`Order`), line items (`LineItem`), transactions (`Transaction`), carts (`CartItem`), discounts (`Discount`), refunds (`Refund`), and configurations for filters (`SearchFilters`, `InputConfig`). The interfaces are extensive and detailed, suggesting a complex data model. Notable is the inclusion of interfaces for handling different aspects of the order lifecycle (creation, editing, and refund) and for managing related data like shipping breakups (`ShippingBreakups`) and price breakups (`PriceBreakup`). The `Order` interface is particularly comprehensive, encapsulating a wide array of order-related attributes.  The interfaces also reflect integration with third-party services like Shopify (indicated through names like `ShopifyAppDiscountOffersSortKeyEnum`).

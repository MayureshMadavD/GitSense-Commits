# Activity Summary for 12/03/2025

## 00:24:02
The log shows several code changes across multiple files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project, primarily focused on analytics and environment configurations.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file (last updated 11/03/2025, 23:43:17) manages environment-specific URLs for various APIs and services (health, address suggestion, etc.).  It uses an `env` variable to determine the appropriate URL based on the environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.), exhibiting a clear pattern of conditional logic based on environment values.  The file also defines functions to retrieve merchant URLs and tokens,  again with conditional logic for different environments.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object in the local environment.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file (last updated 11/03/2025, 23:44:25) is a merchant landing page. It initializes a `gokwikSdk` which seems to handle communication with the Gokwik checkout system via postMessage.  The page includes a button triggering the checkout and  some commented-out analytics code.  It sets cookies `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` to track user navigation.  The `merchantInfo` object contains hardcoded merchant information including a `mid` (merchant ID), potentially overridden based on environment.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/GA4.ts` file undergoes multiple revisions (11/03/2025, 23:47:00, 23:47:39, 12/03/2025, 00:14:57, 00:15:31, 00:17:19).  These revisions primarily involve minor adjustments and the addition of `console.log` statements for debugging.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout the updates:  it defines functions to track various events (`begin_checkout`, `add_shipping_info`, `add_payment_info`, `purchase`, coupon related events) using Google Analytics 4 (GA4).  The code handles different data structures and conditional logic based on whether additional data is passed and the merchant ID.  A special handling is present for `snitch.co.in` domain, suggesting a separate analytics implementation for this particular client.  The file uses a `triggerGAEvent` function to dispatch events through `window.gtag` or `window.dataLayer` based on the domain.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` file (last updated 12/03/2025, 00:14:47) is the main merchant component. It initializes various analytics integrations (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics). It handles merchant information, cart data, and various environment-specific configurations. The code manages cookies and local storage for tracking user sessions and preferences.  It also includes logic for handling different checkout flows (potentially through the `abcRequestId` parameter).  A significant amount of conditional logic is seen to adapt to different environments, merchant IDs, and user agents.  The file interacts extensively with the `EnvironmentService` for URL configurations.

The pattern across all files is a strong emphasis on environment-specific configuration and extensive use of analytics tracking.  The multiple revisions in `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/GA4.ts` suggest iterative development and debugging of the GA4 integration.  The `Merchant.svelte` file highlights a comprehensive approach to integrating with multiple analytics platforms and adapting the checkout flow based on the environment and user context.

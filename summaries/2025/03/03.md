# Activity Summary for 03/03/2025

## 13:57:28
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightbasedshipping.tsx` between 12:00:25 and 12:35:11 on March 3, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on adjustments to the UI layout of buttons within a form. Specifically, the `span` prop values for the "Add Shipping" and "Save" buttons are modified across several commits, changing their relative sizes and positions within the form.  There are also minor code formatting changes, including spacing and the removal of unnecessary commas. The core functionality of adding and saving weight-based shipping rates remains consistent.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` underwent several revisions between 13:17:41 and 13:56:20 on March 3, 2025.  These changes center around implementing discount functionality.  The `discount` state object is extensively used and modified across multiple commits, adding features for managing discounts (type, value, title), applying discounts to line items, handling re-adding deleted items, and updating the UI to reflect discount application. The `calculateGrandTotal` function was revised multiple times to accurately reflect discount calculations, showing iterative debugging and refinement of the discount logic.  Additional logging statements were added for debugging purposes within `calculateGrandTotal`.  The overall goal appears to be creating a robust and accurate discount system within the order editing component.

The log shows a React component (`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`) undergoing significant development related to order editing and discount application.  The file was modified multiple times between 13:58 and 14:43 on March 3rd, 2025.

The primary focus of the changes appears to be refining the discount calculation and display within an order editing interface.  Initially, the `calculateGrandTotal` function contained commented-out code related to discount application and had a logic error in its summation. This was iteratively corrected across several commits, with the final version accurately calculating discounts based on whether it's a fixed amount or percentage, ensuring the discount doesn't exceed the item total.  Extensive logging statements were also added to `calculateGrandTotal` to help debug the discount calculation.

Another notable change is the un-commenting and implementation of the `render` function within the `columns` array for the 'Total' column in the Table component. This makes the total price of each item visible.

The `shouldHideUI` function was added at the end to conditionally hide or show UI elements based on whether discounts are pre-applied and whether quantities have been modified. This improves the user interface.  The `handleReAddItem` function manages re-adding recently deleted items to the order, preventing duplicates.  The `handleOk` and `handleRemoveDiscounts` functions handle discount application and removal, respectively.  There's consistent use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library throughout the code.


## 15:56:43
The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent several revisions on March 3rd, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be refining the discount calculation and display within an order editing component.

The initial revision (15:21:49) established the component's structure, including state variables for line items, modal display, submit button enablement, order details, error handling, and discount information.  The discount state is complex, managing recently deleted items, modal visibility, discount type and value, application status, and more.  The component uses a table to display order line items, offering functionality to modify quantities and delete items.

Subsequent revisions (15:32:29, 15:33:28, 15:33:35) show iterative changes to the `calculateGrandTotal` and the 'Total' column's `render` function within the table.  These changes reflect debugging and refinement of the discount calculation logic.  Specifically, the code added logging statements (`console.log`) for debugging purposes and attempted to correctly handle the grand total calculation within the discount application process. The `grandTotal` variable's handling changed significantly across these revisions.  The changes at 15:33:28 and 15:33:35 show attempts to extract the numerical value from `calculateGrandTotal()`, addressing potential issues with string parsing.

The final revision (15:37:20) made a substantial change to the discount calculation within the 'Total' column renderer. The `itemDiscount` calculation was significantly altered, potentially to better account for proportional discounts based on the grand total.  This suggests that the previous attempts to handle the grand total calculation were unsuccessful, and a new approach was implemented.  The modifications aim for a more precise calculation of discounts applied to individual line items based on their price relative to the overall order total.  Despite the changes, a substantial portion of the `shouldHideUI` function remains truncated in the provided log.

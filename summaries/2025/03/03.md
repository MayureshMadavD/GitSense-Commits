The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightbasedshipping.tsx` between 12:00:25 and 12:35:11 on March 3, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on adjustments to the UI layout of buttons within a form. Specifically, the `span` prop values for the "Add Shipping" and "Save" buttons are modified across several commits, changing their relative sizes and positions within the form.  There are also minor code formatting changes, including spacing and the removal of unnecessary commas. The core functionality of adding and saving weight-based shipping rates remains consistent.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` underwent several revisions between 13:17:41 and 13:56:20 on March 3, 2025.  These changes center around implementing discount functionality.  The `discount` state object is extensively used and modified across multiple commits, adding features for managing discounts (type, value, title), applying discounts to line items, handling re-adding deleted items, and updating the UI to reflect discount application. The `calculateGrandTotal` function was revised multiple times to accurately reflect discount calculations, showing iterative debugging and refinement of the discount logic.  Additional logging statements were added for debugging purposes within `calculateGrandTotal`.  The overall goal appears to be creating a robust and accurate discount system within the order editing component.

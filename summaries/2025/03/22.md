# Activity Summary for 22/03/2025

## 01:11:24
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx` files between March 21st, 23:19 and March 22nd, 01:10.  The changes primarily involve modifications to React component code related to shipping settings in an e-commerce dashboard.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`:  The majority of changes in this file center around the `additionShippingFields` array.  This array defines form fields for advanced shipping configuration, including payment options ('all', 'upi', 'cod'), user types ('new', 'repeat'), discounted prices, and total shipping prices.  There are also several minor edits throughout the file, primarily correcting typos and refining the user interface elements, like changing the label "Shipping Visbility" to "Shipping Visibility."  A `defaultValue` of `null` was added to the `user_type` select option at 22/03/2025, 01:06:01, suggesting the addition of a "Select a User" option was removed. The most significant change occurred around 23:43, when a `Modal` component from `gokwik-ui-kit` was added to the imports.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx`: This file underwent changes related to the handling of saving configurations.  Initially, the `handleShippingSave`, `handleWeightSave`, and `handleDiscountSave` functions all included refetch calls to update other related configurations after a save. Later revisions (starting around 00:22) removed these unnecessary refetch calls from `handleShippingSave`, resulting in a more efficient update mechanism. A `console.log("called")` statement was added to the `handleTabChange` function at 00:20:05 and remains throughout the rest of the changes, potentially for debugging purposes.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx`: This file saw considerable evolution.  The main focus was on improving the handling of form submission and data validation.  The `getValesFromForm` function, responsible for processing form data, was significantly revised multiple times to accommodate updates for editing existing entries and adding new ones. This involved more robust error handling and validation checks (especially for unique shipping names and weight ranges) and refining the update logic.   The most significant changes happened between 00:26 and 00:59 where there was addition of `isModalVisible` state, and significant restructuring of the `getValesFromForm` function to handle unique name validation.  The addition of `Modal` to imports at 00:42 suggests a visual update related to error handling and form management.

Overall, the changes reflect an iterative process of development and refinement, focusing on improving the functionality and user experience of the shipping settings components within the e-commerce dashboard.  The frequent small changes suggest continuous debugging and refinement of the code.

The code consists of two React components: `DiscountBaseShipping` and `ShippingService`.  Both were updated on March 22nd, 2025.

`DiscountBaseShipping.tsx` (01:19:33): This component handles discount-based shipping settings. It uses a form (`gokwik-ui-kit` components) to manage discount codes, match types, and shipping charges.  Key features include:

*   A table displaying existing discount configurations with edit and delete functionality.
*   Form validation to prevent duplicate discount codes.
*   A drawer for editing existing discount entries.
*   Uses `useForm` from `Form` for managing form state.
*   Leverages several helper functions and UI components from a `gokwik-ui-kit` library and internal libraries (`@library`).
*   Significant updates include adding comprehensive form validation, edit/delete functionality for discount entries, and a more robust state management system using `useState` hooks.  The use of `useEffect` ensures that the component state updates when `discountConfigObject` changes.


`ShippingService.tsx` (01:20:47): This component provides a tabbed interface for managing various shipping settings. It uses `Tabs` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  It renders three tabs:

*   "Shipping Method": Uses `ShippingMethodConfig` component.
*   "Weight Based Shipping": Uses `WeightBaseShippingMethods` component.
*   "Discount Based Shipping": Uses `DiscountBaseShipping` component.

The component uses a custom hook `useMerchantConfigApi` to interact with a merchant configuration API (`APIEndPoints`).  It manages saving configurations for each tab separately using individual `refetch` functions and separate `saveConfig` handlers for each tab (`handleShippingSave`, `handleWeightSave`, `handleDiscountSave`). If no shipping price object exists, only the Shipping Method tab is shown.  The conditional rendering based on `shippingPriceObject?.length` is a significant aspect of the component's logic.

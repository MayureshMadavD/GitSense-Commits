# Activity Summary for 20/03/2025

## 13:43:09
The log shows modifications to the `checkout-dashboard-ui` project, primarily focusing on shipping settings components.  The most significant changes are in `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/discountShipping.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` was updated on 20/03/2025, 13:28:56. This file is an HTML template that dynamically loads different JavaScript modules (`@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, etc.) based on the environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The production environment includes Clarity and New Relic scripts.  The changes likely involve updating the URLs for these modules to reflect different deployment environments or versions.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/discountShipping.tsx` underwent multiple revisions between 13:31:16 and 13:42:46. These changes refine the UI component for managing discount-based shipping settings.  The core functionality remains consistent:  a form to manage discount codes, match types, and shipping charges, along with a table displaying configured discounts.  The edits primarily focused on improving form validation (preventing duplicate discount codes), and error handling, and renaming the prop `discontConfig` to `discountConfigObject`.  A `console.log` statement was added and later removed within the `useEffect` hook.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx` was modified several times between 13:32:41 and 13:42:21. This component manages a tabbed interface for different shipping configurations.  The changes include:
*   Adding `console.log` statements to debug the `discountBasedConfig` object. These were later removed or modified.
*   Refactoring how the `Tabs` component filters, potentially for conditional rendering based on the existence of shipping prices.  
*   Correcting a prop name in `DiscountBaseShipping` from `discountConfig` to `discountConfigObject`.

The changes demonstrate iterative development, debugging, and refinement of the UI for managing shipping settings within a dashboard application. The frequent updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx`  suggest that this file was the primary focus of the development effort.  A recurring pattern is the use of `refetch` functions to update data after saving configurations, ensuring consistency across different shipping settings tabs.

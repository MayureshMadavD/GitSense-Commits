# Activity Summary for 20/03/2025

## 13:43:09
The log shows modifications to the `checkout-dashboard-ui` project, primarily focusing on shipping settings components.  The most significant changes are in `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/discountShipping.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` was updated on 20/03/2025, 13:28:56. This file is an HTML template that dynamically loads different JavaScript modules (`@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, etc.) based on the environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The production environment includes Clarity and New Relic scripts.  The changes likely involve updating the URLs for these modules to reflect different deployment environments or versions.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/discountShipping.tsx` underwent multiple revisions between 13:31:16 and 13:42:46. These changes refine the UI component for managing discount-based shipping settings.  The core functionality remains consistent:  a form to manage discount codes, match types, and shipping charges, along with a table displaying configured discounts.  The edits primarily focused on improving form validation (preventing duplicate discount codes), and error handling, and renaming the prop `discontConfig` to `discountConfigObject`.  A `console.log` statement was added and later removed within the `useEffect` hook.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx` was modified several times between 13:32:41 and 13:42:21. This component manages a tabbed interface for different shipping configurations.  The changes include:
*   Adding `console.log` statements to debug the `discountBasedConfig` object. These were later removed or modified.
*   Refactoring how the `Tabs` component filters, potentially for conditional rendering based on the existence of shipping prices.  
*   Correcting a prop name in `DiscountBaseShipping` from `discountConfig` to `discountConfigObject`.

The changes demonstrate iterative development, debugging, and refinement of the UI for managing shipping settings within a dashboard application. The frequent updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx`  suggest that this file was the primary focus of the development effort.  A recurring pattern is the use of `refetch` functions to update data after saving configurations, ensuring consistency across different shipping settings tabs.


## 18:43:04
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/` directory, focusing on  charting and reporting functionalities.

The `barChart.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 18:26:39 and 18:29:32 on March 20, 2025. These revisions likely involved bug fixes or minor improvements, as the core functionality of calculating and displaying weekly ARR (Average Recurring Revenue) and merchant counts remained unchanged across the commits.  The functions `calculateWeeks`, `calculateWeeklyARR`, and `calculateMerchantsPerWeek`  handle data processing, focusing on filtering, summing, and formatting data for charting.  They use the `date-fns` library extensively for date manipulation and calculations.  The chart displays Shopify data for SMB and ENT merchants, showing target vs. actual go-live data.


The `weeklyreport.jsx` file was updated at 18:35:05 on March 20, 2025. This component renders weekly reports using data processed by functions in `reportfunctions.js`.  It displays tables summarizing pending and live merchants, broken down by SMB, ENT, and emerging categories, both for Shopify and non-Shopify platforms.  The component uses `useCallback` and `useMemo` hooks for performance optimization.  The `renderTable` and related functions dynamically generate tables based on the data received and highlight whether targets are met ("On Track" or "Off Track"). The calculations for "On Track"/"Off Track" seem to be based on a weekly average target derived from the total target divided by 13 weeks.  For non-Shopify data, a different target of 18 is used.  The code extensively uses helper functions from `reportfunctions.js` for data manipulation and calculation (e.g., `uniqueDataHandlerArry`, `sumOfCountForParticularArrayField`, `filterMerchantByGolive`, `calculateWeeklyARRForWeek`, `calculateMerchantsPerWeek`).


## 23:07:18
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file between 22:24:42 and 22:30:36 on 20/03/2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and do not affect the overall structure or functionality of the component.  The code defines a React component (`ShippingMethodConfig`) that handles shipping method configuration, including input fields for shipping price, minimum and maximum order values, and advanced conditions.  A key feature is the CSV file upload functionality which validates pincodes.  There are no substantive code changes across the revisions; rather, the timestamps suggest iterative development with minor adjustments possibly related to formatting or very small bug fixes. The component utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements and performs validation on user inputs.

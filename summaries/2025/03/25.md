# Activity Summary for 25/03/2025

## 12:01:15
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file on March 25th, 2025.  The changes appear to be incremental refinements to a React component responsible for configuring shipping methods.  There are no substantial structural changes across the revisions; instead, the modifications focus on the component's internal state and UI elements.

The core of the component involves a form (`Form.useForm()`)  for managing shipping settings. This form utilizes an array named `fields` to define input fields, including:  shipping name, price, minimum and maximum order value.  A CSV file upload is also implemented using the `Upload` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`, validating the input for 6-digit pincodes.  Error handling is incorporated using `message.error()` for invalid file formats and input data.

The `additionShippingFields` array defines additional settings like shipping visibility (select), payment options (select), user type (select for new or repeat users), discounted price (number), total shipping price (number), and COD charges (number).  The `tableHeader` array suggests a table is used for displaying shipping configurations.


The timestamps indicate a period of focused development between 11:24 and 11:30 AM, with multiple iterations likely related to debugging or minor UI adjustments.  No significant functional changes are evident between the revisions; the primary modifications appear to be related to the handling of form validation and error messages.

The provided code logs show modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project, specifically focusing on environment service configuration and discount functionalities.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated twice within a short time frame (12:29:31 and 12:29:40 on March 25, 2025).  These updates did not change the functionality of the code, but rather only changed the order of the imports.  The file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs based on the current environment ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.).  Numerous URLs are hardcoded, indicating a comprehensive setup for different deployment stages.  The `env` variable, sourced from `store_environment`, dictates the URL returned by these functions.  Additionally, functions to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) are defined, returning different values based on the environment.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with specific data, including item details and a token.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file (updated at 12:32:38 on March 25, 2025) is an HTML file representing a merchant page. It includes JavaScript code that interacts with a `gokwikSdk`. This SDK appears to manage payment processing through postMessage interactions with a parent window. The script also includes code to manage cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), suggesting tracking of user navigation. Notably, it contains hardcoded merchant and application IDs and secrets, which are sensitive and should not be directly included within this type of file.  The file also contains an embedded gokwik button.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file (updated at 12:49:29 on March 25, 2025) is a Svelte component responsible for handling discounts during the checkout process. It interacts with numerous stores (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_discountCode`, `store_offers`)  to manage discount codes, offers, and related logic.  The code is extensive, indicating a complex discount system with features such as:  handling multiple coupon types, applying automatic and manual discounts, stacking discounts subject to configuration, managing loyalty programs and gift cards, integration with various payment gateways (CRED, TwidPay), and providing feedback via snackbars. The component uses several helper functions and services to interact with backend APIs, managing the display of available offers and applying discounts based on various conditions and business rules. The component also appears to handle various edge cases, and error scenarios.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/Login.service.ts` contains the source code for user login and authentication services.  The code was last updated on 25/03/2025 at 15:56:41.

The `Login.service.ts` file heavily uses MobX stores (`store_...`) for managing application state, including user information, address details, cart information, and various flags for different login flows (Truecaller, SSO, BPoc).  The code interacts extensively with several services: `MerchantAPI` (for login verification, cart updates), `EventService` (for logging events and analytics), `Helper.service.js` (for cookie and address handling),  `Discounts.service` (for offer retrieval), and potentially an `EnvironmentService` (based on the import).

The `verifyUser` function is central to the login process, handling various scenarios including Truecaller integration, SSO, and error conditions.  It updates multiple MobX stores based on the API response, including user type, addresses, cart information, and various flags.  It also logs events and fires analytics using `fireAnalytics`, `fireAnalyticsGa4`, and `facebookEvents`.

The `getTruecallerUserData` function manages the interaction with the Truecaller API, polling for user data and handling different response statuses.  Upon successful verification, it calls `verifyUser` to complete the login process.

The `triggerBpocLogin` function handles a specific login flow (likely Business-to-Person/Business-to-Consumer).

The code extensively uses error handling and logging (`stabilityEvent`, `logEvent`).  Recurring patterns include the use of asynchronous operations (`async/await`), the extensive use of MobX stores for state management, and consistent logging of events for monitoring and analytics.  The code also includes mechanisms to handle different user types ('new', 'existing'), and different address sources ('shopify_merchant_webhook', 'truecaller', etc.). The code shows careful consideration for handling various error scenarios and ensuring data consistency across different parts of the application.

The log shows modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/ss/ssss/index.html`.  The file is an HTML document that dynamically creates and appends an iframe to the page. The iframe's source is consistently set to  `https://www.duroflexworld.com/checkouts/cn/Z2NwLWFzaWEtc291dGhlYXN0MTowMUpQUzRINFRQU01CN0JXQzZOVjhSOURGVg`.

The initial two entries (20:13:45 and 20:14:24) are nearly identical, differing only by a one minute interval. The significant change occurs at 20:25:35, where the `iframe` element has the attribute `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` added.  This addition likely enhances the security of the iframe by controlling the scripts it can execute.  The styling of the iframe (position, size, z-index) remains consistent across all revisions.

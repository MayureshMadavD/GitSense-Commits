# Activity Summary for 25/03/2025

## 12:01:15
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file on March 25th, 2025.  The changes appear to be incremental refinements to a React component responsible for configuring shipping methods.  There are no substantial structural changes across the revisions; instead, the modifications focus on the component's internal state and UI elements.

The core of the component involves a form (`Form.useForm()`)  for managing shipping settings. This form utilizes an array named `fields` to define input fields, including:  shipping name, price, minimum and maximum order value.  A CSV file upload is also implemented using the `Upload` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`, validating the input for 6-digit pincodes.  Error handling is incorporated using `message.error()` for invalid file formats and input data.

The `additionShippingFields` array defines additional settings like shipping visibility (select), payment options (select), user type (select for new or repeat users), discounted price (number), total shipping price (number), and COD charges (number).  The `tableHeader` array suggests a table is used for displaying shipping configurations.


The timestamps indicate a period of focused development between 11:24 and 11:30 AM, with multiple iterations likely related to debugging or minor UI adjustments.  No significant functional changes are evident between the revisions; the primary modifications appear to be related to the handling of form validation and error messages.

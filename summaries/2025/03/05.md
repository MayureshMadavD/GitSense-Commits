# Activity Summary for 05/03/2025

## 23:57:35
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte` file, last modified on 05/03/2025 at 23:42:57, is a Svelte component representing a bottom sheet.  The component manages various states related to payment processing, including order status (INITIATE, PENDING, SUCCESS, FAIL), payment methods (UPI, CARD), and offers.  It interacts with several stores, including `CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, and `OrderStore`, to access and update application state.

Key updates include extensive use of reactive declarations (`onMount`, `onDestroy`, store subscriptions) to manage component state and handle events.  The component dynamically renders content based on various flags (`showPopup`, `paymentStatus`, `currentPage`, etc.), including payment status indicators, offer banners, and different content based on the current page.  Error handling is implemented within the `handleOnpl` function, gracefully handling potential exceptions.  Event logging (`logEvent`) is integrated to track payment-related actions.  The component also incorporates transitions (`fly`) for smooth UI updates and utilizes custom styling using SCSS.  The logic for handling UPI payments and fallback flows is complex and extensively uses conditional statements.  The component also shows an address count if the current page is 2 and the type is `otp_input_page`.

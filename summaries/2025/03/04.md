The code represents a React component `DiscountBaseShipping` for managing discount-based shipping settings.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and includes a form for configuring discount codes, match types, and shipping charges.  A table displays existing configurations, allowing for editing and deletion via a dropdown menu.

The April 3rd, 2025, 11:04:47 commit significantly updates the component's functionality. Key changes include:

* **Enhanced UI:**  The component incorporates a `Drawer` for editing shipping configurations, improving the user experience.  This drawer provides 'Apply Shipping' and 'Discard' buttons for managing edits.  Error handling for duplicate discount codes is added.
* **Data Handling:** The component now manages its state using `useState` for various aspects like form data (`discountConfig`, `prevFormState`), edit mode (`isEditEnabled`), and button visibility (`saveButtonVisibility`, `button`).  A `saveConfig` prop suggests integration with a backend to persist changes.  The `getValesFromForm` function is declared but not implemented.
* **Form Validation:** Input validation is implemented using Form.Item rules, including a custom validator to prevent duplicate discount codes.  Validation for positive numbers in shipping charges is also present.
* **Table Functionality:** A table displays existing discount configurations with actions (Edit, Delete) provided via a dropdown menu in each row.  The table uses the `formatAmount` helper function to format the shipping charges.


The code uses nested arrays for managing form fields, leading to slightly complex structure.  Conditional rendering based on enable/disable states and edit mode adds to the complexity.  The `fields` array defines the form layout and elements.  The component extensively uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for styling and UI components.  The overall structure suggests a well-designed component for managing complex shipping configurations in a user-friendly interface.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` on April 3rd, 2025.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the import map within `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` tags.  These tags dynamically load different versions of the Gokwik Dashboard components (`@gokwik/*`) based on the environment (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).

Initially (17:25:57), the `index.ejs` file contained import map entries pointing to various localhost and `dev-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` URLs for different Gokwik modules.  Subsequent revisions (17:33:03, 17:33:14, 17:35:08, 17:35:39)  adjusted the URLs for `@gokwik/dashboard` and `@gokwik/utilities`, shifting some from `dev-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`  to `sandbox.gokwik.in` and `sandbox-dashboard.gokwik.in`, indicating a change in deployment strategy for these specific modules across different environments. The final revision (17:36:03) appears to be a minor adjustment, reverting `@gokwik/utilities`  back to `sandbox-dashboard.gokwik.in` while keeping the other changes from earlier revisions. The production environment (`deployedEnv==='production'`) always includes New Relic and Clarity tracking scripts, with the Clarity key conditionally rendered.  There's no discernible pattern beyond environment-specific URL adjustments for the Gokwik modules in the `index.ejs` file.  The frequent updates suggest ongoing development and deployment activities.

The provided log shows modifications to two React component files: `discountShipping.tsx` and `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`.  The changes span from 22:12 to 23:03 on March 21, 2025.

`discountShipping.tsx` underwent several revisions within a short timeframe (22:12:56 to 22:15:34). These changes primarily focused on refining the form validation and handling of discount code entries.  A key modification was adding a check to prevent duplicate discount codes.  Another notable change involved handling potential `null` values in `formatAmount` to prevent errors.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and includes features like a form for adding/editing discount configurations, a table to display existing configurations, and a drawer for editing individual entries.


`shippingBasedMethods.tsx` shows a longer series of edits (22:22:40 to 23:03:47), indicating iterative development.  The main focus of these changes appears to be on improving the handling of CSV file uploads for pincodes, enhancing error messages and adding a 'Select a User' option to the user type selection. The component also uses `gokwik-ui-kit` and handles shipping method configuration, including input validation. The `beforeUpload` function validates the format and content of uploaded CSV files containing pincodes.  Throughout the changes, validation rules are repeatedly refined for input fields, ensuring data integrity.  The addition of the null value in the User Type select is a significant change to avoid errors.

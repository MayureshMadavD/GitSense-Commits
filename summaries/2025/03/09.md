# Activity Summary for 09/03/2025

## 22:44:41
The codebase focuses on generating weekly reports, differentiating between Shopify and non-Shopify merchants.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/weeklyreport/weeklyreport.jsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 20:09 and 20:18 on September 3rd, 2025. These revisions primarily involved minor formatting changes (like adding `fontWeight: "700"` for bold text) within the JSX code rendering tables.  The core logic and functionality remained unchanged during this period.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/dashboard/weeklyreport/page.jsx` file was modified multiple times between 20:14 and 20:24 on September 3rd, 2025. The changes center around refining the logic for identifying and separating non-Shopify merchants. The initial filter (`data?.platform.toLowerCase().trim() !== "shopify"`) was iteratively adjusted, with several attempts to precisely define what constitutes a non-Shopify merchant based on the `platform` field's value (handling empty strings and null values). The final version at 20:24 uses `data?.platform.toLowerCase().trim() === "" || data?.platform.toLowerCase().trim() !== 'shopify'`.  This suggests an ongoing effort to improve data handling and filtering accuracy.  The file consistently fetches data using functions like `getAllDetails`, `getTodaySummaryReports`, `getGoLiveMerchantsByDateRange`, and `filterAllTheMerchant` from the backend (`/backend/query` and `/backend/backendservice`).

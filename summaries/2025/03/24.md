The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file, modified on 24/03/2025 at 10:45:55, is a React component for configuring shipping methods.  It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements like forms, tables, modals, and alerts.

The component features a form for adding shipping prices with fields for name, price, minimum and maximum order values.  It includes validation rules to ensure data integrity (e.g., positive numbers only).  Advanced conditions can be set via a modal.  A CSV file upload feature allows for bulk input of pincodes, with validation to ensure 6-digit format.  The component also has fields for setting shipping visibility, payment options (all, UPI, COD), user type (new or repeat), discounted prices, and COD charges.  A table displays existing shipping configurations.  The code utilizes several custom hooks like `useState` and `useMemo`, as well as custom helper functions such as `formatAmount`.  The component incorporates error handling and informative tooltips.  The `shippingConfig` prop likely contains the current shipping configuration data.  The `saveConfig` prop likely handles saving the updated configuration.  The `weightConfig` propâ€™s purpose is unclear from the provided snippet.  The code extensively uses functional components and JSX.

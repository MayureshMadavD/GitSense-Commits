# Activity Summary for 24/03/2025

## 11:38:23
The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file, modified on 24/03/2025 at 10:45:55, is a React component for configuring shipping methods.  It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements like forms, tables, modals, and alerts.

The component features a form for adding shipping prices with fields for name, price, minimum and maximum order values.  It includes validation rules to ensure data integrity (e.g., positive numbers only).  Advanced conditions can be set via a modal.  A CSV file upload feature allows for bulk input of pincodes, with validation to ensure 6-digit format.  The component also has fields for setting shipping visibility, payment options (all, UPI, COD), user type (new or repeat), discounted prices, and COD charges.  A table displays existing shipping configurations.  The code utilizes several custom hooks like `useState` and `useMemo`, as well as custom helper functions such as `formatAmount`.  The component incorporates error handling and informative tooltips.  The `shippingConfig` prop likely contains the current shipping configuration data.  The `saveConfig` prop likely handles saving the updated configuration.  The `weightConfig` propâ€™s purpose is unclear from the provided snippet.  The code extensively uses functional components and JSX.

The timestamps indicate that these commits happened within a short time frame (12:12:08, 12:17:28, and 12:18:08).  The code itself is a React component responsible for configuring shipping methods.  The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements and handles form input for shipping price, minimum/maximum order values, and advanced conditions.  There's also functionality for uploading a CSV file containing pincodes, which is validated to ensure that all entries are 6-digit numbers.  The component includes fields for setting shipping visibility, payment options (UPI, COD, or all), user type for discounts, and discounted/total shipping prices.  The code remains largely unchanged across the three commits, suggesting minor edits or potential accidental repeated commits rather than substantial functional changes.

# Activity Summary for 07/03/2025

## 00:40:36
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/discountShipping.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file underwent multiple revisions between 17:42:58 and 17:45:33.  These changes primarily involved conditional rendering of `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` blocks based on environment variables (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  Each block defines import maps for various @gokwik modules, switching between localhost URLs for local development and different domain URLs (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`) for different deployment environments.  The production environment also includes conditional rendering of Clarity and New Relic tracking scripts, based on a `clarityKey` variable.  The core structure of the HTML remained consistent throughout these revisions.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/discountShipping.tsx` file was modified twice, at 17:57:44 and then again at 18:04:35 and 18:04:56.  The changes focus on a React component for managing discount-based shipping settings.  The component uses a form with various input types (`switch`, `input`, `select`, `button`) rendered using a custom `RenderField` component.  The form handles adding and editing discount shipping configurations, including validation to prevent duplicate discount codes. A table displays the existing discount configurations, with options to edit or delete entries.  The most significant change between the revisions was an update to the span value of a button from 2 to 3 in the `fields` array at 18:04:56.  The functionality of adding/editing discount codes and their corresponding shipping charges remains consistent throughout the edits, with improvements in validation and error handling.


## 11:36:26
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx`  between 10:40:58 and 11:04:43 on July 3rd, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing weight-based shipping settings.

Key changes across the revisions include:

* **UI refinements:**  Several commits focus on minor UI adjustments, primarily involving styling and layout changes to the form elements.  For example, the "Save" button's margin is adjusted (`ml-7` added), and the `colon` prop is added and set to `false` in several form fields.  The "Add Shipping" button's `span` is changed from 2 to 3 in one revision.

* **Form field updates:** The `label` for the `shipping_name` field is changed from 'Weight Based Shipping Name' back and forth between that and simply 'Shipping Name'.  This suggests iterative refinement of the user interface.

* **No functional changes detected:** While there are multiple commits, there are no apparent significant changes to the core functionality of the component. The validation logic and data handling remain consistent throughout the revisions. The changes seem mostly related to style and layout improvements and possibly addressing minor bugs.  All changes affect the layout or styling of the weight-based shipping settings component.

The iterative nature of the commits, with frequent small changes, suggests a process of incremental improvement and testing rather than a large-scale refactoring.

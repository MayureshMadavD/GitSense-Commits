# Activity Summary for 07/03/2025

The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/discountShipping.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file underwent multiple revisions between 17:42:58 and 17:45:33.  These changes primarily involved conditional rendering of `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` blocks based on environment variables (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  Each block defines import maps for various @gokwik modules, switching between localhost URLs for local development and different domain URLs (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`) for different deployment environments.  The production environment also includes conditional rendering of Clarity and New Relic tracking scripts, based on a `clarityKey` variable.  The core structure of the HTML remained consistent throughout these revisions.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/discountShipping.tsx` file was modified twice, at 17:57:44 and then again at 18:04:35 and 18:04:56.  The changes focus on a React component for managing discount-based shipping settings.  The component uses a form with various input types (`switch`, `input`, `select`, `button`) rendered using a custom `RenderField` component.  The form handles adding and editing discount shipping configurations, including validation to prevent duplicate discount codes. A table displays the existing discount configurations, with options to edit or delete entries.  The most significant change between the revisions was an update to the span value of a button from 2 to 3 in the `fields` array at 18:04:56.  The functionality of adding/editing discount codes and their corresponding shipping charges remains consistent throughout the edits, with improvements in validation and error handling.

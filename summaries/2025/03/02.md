# Activity Summary for 02/03/2025

## 18:00:13
The log shows significant updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/` project, focusing on weekly and daily reports.  The most significant changes occurred between 17:00:06 and 17:59:17 on 02/03/2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/barChart.jsx`: This file contains code for a bar chart visualizing SMB merchant data.  It includes functions `calculateWeeks` and `calculateWeeklyARR` to process and aggregate data for weekly ARR (Average Recurring Revenue) calculations.  The `calculateMerchantsPerWeek` function handles calculations for emerging merchants.  The code uses `date-fns` for date manipulation and `react-chartjs-2` for chart rendering.  A `helperFunctionForGettingRemainingData` (defined elsewhere) is utilized to account for data from the last incomplete week.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/dashboard/weeklyreport/page.jsx`: This component fetches data from a backend using functions like `getAllDetails`, `getTodaySummaryReports`, `getMerchantDataByDateRangeOnMultipleField`, and `filterAllTheMerchant`.  It then passes the processed data (Shopify and non-Shopify merchants) to the `WeeklyReport` component.  There were numerous revisions to this file, primarily changing how the backend data was fetched and the specific data being fetched and passed to the `WeeklyReport` component.  The final version uses `getGoLiveMerchantsByDateRange` which indicates a shift to retrieving go-live data from the backend.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/weeklyreport/weeklyreport.jsx`: This file, heavily modified throughout the log, renders a weekly report using React.  It uses several helper functions from `reportfunctions.js` for data processing and table rendering.  The component displays tables for Shopify and non-Shopify merchants, categorizing data by SMB, ENT, and Emerging merchants.  Significant changes involve refining the rendering logic for tables displaying pending, live, and target data for each merchant category.  Initial versions included tables for each merchant category (SMB, ENT, Emerging) showing pending and live data.  Later versions consolidated the SMB and ENT target data into a single table.  Finally, nearly all table data rendering was commented out at the end of the log.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/reportfunctions.js`: This file contains helper functions used by the report components.  The functions include `uniqueDataHandlerArry` for data aggregation, `sumOfCountForParticularArrayField` for summing specific fields,  `filterMerchantByGolive` and `filterMerchantByPending` for filtering merchants by go-live status, and `calculateWeeklyARRForWeek` and `calculateMerchantsPerWeek` for calculating weekly ARR and merchant counts.  A `getCurrentWeekRange` function provides the start and end dates of the current week, and a `helperFunctionForGettingRemainingData` (implementation not shown) adds expected ARR for remaining days in the week.  The  `filterDataByDate` function is also included but appears to be commented out in the final version.

Recurring patterns include consistent use of `date-fns` for date handling, a focus on SMB, ENT, and Emerging merchant categories, and extensive use of helper functions for data manipulation and aggregation.  The prevalent use of `useCallback` and `useMemo` in the React components indicates optimization strategies aimed at improving performance.  The final version of `weeklyreport.jsx` significantly reduces the number of tables displayed, suggesting a simplification of the UI.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` file, last updated on `15/10/2025, 18:18:57`, is a core component for managing merchant data within a dashboard application.

This file leverages Ant Design extensively for its user interface, importing a wide array of components such as `Table`, `Form`, `Select`, `DatePicker`, `Modal`, and `Button`. It integrates several custom utility functions from `extraFunctionForMerchant.js` for data manipulation, filtering, and export (e.g., `createOptionsListForFilter`, `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`, `exportDataToCsv`), as well as a `FormRenderer` component for dynamic form generation. Backend interactions are handled through `createNewMerchant`, `deletEntryForMerchant`, and `updateMerchantByID` queries.

Key features and updates in this component include:

*   **Comprehensive Form Definition:** A detailed `formFeilds` array defines numerous input fields for merchant details, covering various types (input, select, textarea, date, number), validation rules, placeholder texts, and Ant Design grid spans. This allows for flexible creation and editing of merchant profiles. Notable fields include `cename`, `merchantname`, `kickoff`, `targetgolive`, `livedate`, `expectedarr`, `bookedarr`, `mintcomment`, and `opscomment`. Conditional rendering for fields like `cename` based on `currentUser?.isAdmin` indicates role-based access control.
*   **Robust Table Configuration:** The `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` defines a rich table structure with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities. It includes filters for text (`cename`, `merchantname`), boolean (`mqm`), numeric ranges (`expectedarr`, `bookedarr` using `getNumericFilterDropdown`), and date ranges (`kickoff`, `targetgolive` using `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`). Date columns also feature custom rendering using `date-fns` for formatting.
*   **Merchant Lifecycle Management:** The component supports the full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) cycle for merchant entries. A `showDeleteConfirm` function with Ant Design's `Modal.confirm` provides user confirmation before deletion, displaying success or error messages from backend operations.
*   **Modular Design:** The use of dedicated components like `MerchantStatusBar` and `FormRenderer`, along with separate utility functions, indicates a structured and modular approach to development.
*   **Data Handling:** Extensive use of `date-fns` for date manipulation and formatting is evident, particularly in table rendering and filter logic.
*   **State Management:** Utilizes React's `useState` for managing UI visibility, page size, modal states, and column configurations, and `useRef` for maintaining references like `previousMintComment`.

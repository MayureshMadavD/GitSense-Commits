# Activity Summary for 29/10/2025

## 11:09:20
The provided log details entries for a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The content of this Dockerfile remains absolutely consistent across all three recorded timestamps. There were no actual code modifications observed within the log entries.

The Dockerfile outlines a standard build process for a Node.js 20 application within an Alpine Linux environment. Key steps include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` via `apk add --no-cache`.
*   Copying `package*.json` first for efficient Docker layer caching.
*   Installing dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application using `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port 3000.
*   Defining `npm start` as the command to run the application.

The file's state was logged at three distinct, closely spaced timestamps: 28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; and 28/10/2025, 12:29:42. These timestamps suggest multiple saves or checks of the same unchanged Dockerfile content within a short timeframe of just over two minutes.

The primary pattern observed is the complete repetition of the Dockerfile's content, indicating that the file's configuration was stable and unchanged across all log entries.

## 11:09:52
The code changes primarily focus on refining API interactions related to abandoned carts, product/collection fetching, and merchant configurations, with a notable emphasis on GST data handling.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:17:** Introduced core API functions: `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (for searching and filtering active products/collections, including variant mapping), `updateMerchantData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` (for fetching product variant or collection details), and an initial `validateGstData` function.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:08:31 - 18:08:46:** Minor refactoring of `validateGstData` to import `message` from `gokwik-ui-kit` and return a success message on successful validation.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:12:15:** The `validateGstData` function was significantly updated. It was refactored to first call a `validateGstData` endpoint and, if successful, then proceed to call a new `setGstData` endpoint. The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was removed.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:36:58:** The `validateGstData` function was simplified again, removing the initial `validateGstData` API call and directly calling `APIEndPoints.setGstData`.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:37:08 - 19:49:29:** Minor adjustments to error handling in `validateGstData` (returning `null` instead of `false` on catch) and how the response data is returned (`response?.data` vs `response`).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:40:** Defined `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` API endpoints, along with a comprehensive list of other dashboard and agent-order related endpoints, including analytics for checkout, website, and discounts.
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:55:43:** Added a new endpoint: `setGstData: '/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set'`. Concurrently, `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` endpoints were removed, indicating a potential change in data fetching strategy or their relocation.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:17:26:** Configured UI elements for checkout customization, including settings for one-click checkout, discount application (showing confetti, disabling discounts), exit popouts (standard vs. capture reasons), and order summary display (showing MRP with strikethrough). It also included functionality for merchant logo uploads with validation.
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:21:00:** No functional code changes were observed, suggesting a minor save or formatting adjustment.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:58:38:** Initial implementation for editing abandoned carts, featuring extensive state management for customer details, addresses, line items, and payment methods. Functions for customer and address creation/fetching (`fetchCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `fetchCustomerAddressess`, `fetchAddress`) and order creation (`createOrder`) were present.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:44:01:** Added `merchant_id` to component scope by using the `getMerchantDetails` selector.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:04:58:** An image import was changed from `sparkle.svg` to `bookinfo.svg` (this change might be a typo in the log path, as `sparkle.svg` was originally in `checkoutElementPage.tsx`). Assuming the log is correct, `BookDownload` was imported.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:21:29:** Additional image imports for `Map` and `BreifCase` were added.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:35:58:** The component's local state (`state`) was extended to include `gstDetails: null`, preparing for GST-related information storage.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:37:00:** The `gokwik-ui-kit` import for `DeleteOutlined` was updated to also include `DeleteFilled`, indicating a possible UI icon change.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:50:59:** The imported image `BookDownload` had its path updated from `bookinfo.svg` to `gstBook.svg`, further supporting the new focus on GST.
    *   Multiple identical timestamps (e.g., between 17:59:26 and 18:07:26, and numerous later entries) for this file suggest frequent saves or minor, non-functional edits (like formatting) not captured in the diff.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **API Centric Development:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around modifying API endpoints and their corresponding utility functions. This suggests an active development phase involving backend integration and data handling.
*   **GST Data Integration:** A clear pattern emerges with the introduction and refinement of `validateGstData` and `setGstData` endpoints and their usage in the `api.ts` utility and the `editAbcCart.tsx` component (by adding `gstDetails` to its state and updating a related image asset). This indicates a new feature or enhancement for handling Goods and Services Tax information.
*   **UI Customization and Configuration:** `checkoutElementPage.tsx` shows continuous efforts in allowing merchants to customize their checkout experience through various toggles and options, including visual elements like logos.
*   **Abandoned Cart Management:** `editAbcCart.tsx` demonstrates ongoing work on the abandoned cart feature, with detailed state management and customer interaction logic.
*   **Frequent Saves/Minor Edits:** The high number of identical or nearly identical code changes across consecutive timestamps for `editAbcCart.tsx` and `checkoutElementPage.tsx` suggests developers are frequently saving their work, possibly using an auto-save feature or making small, iterative changes.
*   **Dependency on `@gokwik/utilities` and `gokwik-ui-kit`:** Both utility and UI components are consistently imported and used, indicating a standardized approach to development within the Gokwik ecosystem.

## 11:10:01
The code changes primarily revolve around the GoKwik checkout UI, focusing on environment configuration, analytics integration, and merchant-side interaction. Significant modifications were made across two main files and two new files were introduced, all occurring between October 27th and October 29th, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**:
    *   **Recurring Endpoint Changes**: The `api_url` for the `local` environment was frequently toggled between `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` and `https://api.gokwik.co` on October 27th, October 28th, and October 29th. This indicates active development and testing across different API environments.
    *   **Cart Data Updates**: The `setCart` function, used for populating hardcoded cart data in local environments, underwent two significant updates.
        *   On October 28th at 13:29:25, the cart `token`, `note`, `attributes` (adding `LUID`, `SESSION_ID`, `WE_DATA`, `Gokwik`), `total_price`, `item_count`, and product details were completely changed from a single "5 Pocket Jean" to a different item.
        *   Again on October 29th at 11:01:39, the `setCart` function was updated with a new cart `token`, additional `attributes` (`platform_source`, `gb_values`, `client_id`, `ga_session_id`), and new product details for "Lazy Days Brown Oversized Printed Exclusive Shirt" including discount information.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**:
    *   This file, a central point for integrating external analytics, saw several iterative changes focused on debugging and logging.
    *   **Debugging Local Storage Token**: On October 28th, there were multiple additions and removals of a `console.log` statement within the `store_localStorageObject.subscribe` block to display the "Token Is Visible". This suggests active debugging of token retrieval.
    *   **Temporary Skip OTP Logging**: Briefly on October 28th, an import for `store_isSkipOtp` was added along with a `console.log` for its value, which was subsequently removed. This indicates temporary debugging of a "skip OTP" feature.
    *   **Page State Tracking**: `store_page` was imported and a `pageNumber` variable was introduced on October 28th to track the current page, with a `console.log` added to the `store_phoneNo.subscribe` block to correlate phone number events with the current page.
    *   **Final Debugging Removal**: By October 28th at 16:12:33, the `store_isSkipOtp` import and the `store_localStorageObject.subscribe` block were removed, leaving only the `pageNumber` logging in relation to phone number events.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**:
    *   **New File (October 28th, 14:44:14)**: This Svelte component was introduced to manage the merchant-side integration of the GoKwik checkout. Key aspects include:
        *   Loading the GoKwik checkout JavaScript.
        *   Extensive cookie (e.g., `_shopify_s`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`) and URL parameter parsing to gather session and marketing data.
        *   Handling interactions with an embedded iframe, including launching the checkout.
        *   `truecallerConfig` with environment-specific values.
        *   A hardcoded `window.merchantInfo` object for local testing, including merchant ID, environment (`local`), store ID, and Facebook Pixel ID.
        *   Logic for checking available UPI apps and "cash to prepaid" flows.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts`**:
    *   **New File (October 28th, 15:44:07)**: This file was added to specifically handle event tracking and user identification for CleverTap.
        *   It defines a mapping of data keys and functions to construct event payloads for various checkout stages (e.g., `Mobile_Added_GK`, `PIN_Code_Added_GK`, `Payment_Method_Selected_GK`, `GK_Charged`, `User_Address_Added_GK`).
        *   Includes specialized logic for handling "Charged" events with different data structures based on configuration flags and merchant origin (e.g., "levi").

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**:
    *   **New File (October 29th, 11:02:27)**: This HTML file was introduced as a local testing page for the merchant checkout.
        *   It contains a custom JavaScript `gokwikSdk` to initialize and interact with the checkout.
        *   Includes a simple UI form for developers to manually input merchant ID and cart JSON, and select an environment, saving this data to cookies for testing.
        *   Features a hardcoded `window.merchantInfo` object for local development, mirroring the one in `Merchant.svelte`.
        *   Manages setting and retrieving essential cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to simulate user journey data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Local Development Focus**: A strong pattern of local debugging and testing is evident through frequently changed hardcoded cart data, environment URLs, and temporary console logs.
*   **Comprehensive Analytics**: The addition of dedicated analytics files (`ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `CleverTap.ts`) and numerous imports related to various platforms indicate a robust strategy for tracking user behavior and checkout events across multiple services.
*   **Cookie and URL Parameter Dependency**: The system heavily relies on cookies and URL query parameters to propagate crucial information like session IDs, UTM sources, and specific analytics identifiers across different parts of the checkout flow.
*   **Checkout Flow Integration**: The changes highlight a consistent effort to configure, integrate, and debug the GoKwik checkout UI, including environment setup, event tracking, and merchant-side interaction points.

## 12:09:19
The log details changes exclusively for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The Dockerfile is consistently configured to:
*   Utilize `node:20-alpine` as its base image.
*   Set the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
*   Install `openssl` as an essential build tool.
*   Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first for efficient caching of dependencies.
*   Install project dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copy the entire application source code.
*   Generate the Prisma schema via `npx prisma generate`.
*   Build the application using `npm run build`.
*   Expose port `3000`.
*   Start the application with the command `npm start`.

Significant timestamps for this file are 28/10/2025 at 12:27:10, 12:27:41, and 12:29:42. A prominent pattern observed is that the content of the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` remained identical across all three recorded timestamps, indicating no functional changes were introduced to the Dockerfile within these log entries. The timestamps likely represent successive saves or logs of the same Dockerfile configuration.

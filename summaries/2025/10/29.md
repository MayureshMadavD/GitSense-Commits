# Activity Summary for 29/10/2025

## 11:09:20
The provided log details entries for a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The content of this Dockerfile remains absolutely consistent across all three recorded timestamps. There were no actual code modifications observed within the log entries.

The Dockerfile outlines a standard build process for a Node.js 20 application within an Alpine Linux environment. Key steps include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` via `apk add --no-cache`.
*   Copying `package*.json` first for efficient Docker layer caching.
*   Installing dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application using `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port 3000.
*   Defining `npm start` as the command to run the application.

The file's state was logged at three distinct, closely spaced timestamps: 28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; and 28/10/2025, 12:29:42. These timestamps suggest multiple saves or checks of the same unchanged Dockerfile content within a short timeframe of just over two minutes.

The primary pattern observed is the complete repetition of the Dockerfile's content, indicating that the file's configuration was stable and unchanged across all log entries.

The code changes primarily focus on refining API interactions related to abandoned carts, product/collection fetching, and merchant configurations, with a notable emphasis on GST data handling.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:17:** Introduced core API functions: `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (for searching and filtering active products/collections, including variant mapping), `updateMerchantData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` (for fetching product variant or collection details), and an initial `validateGstData` function.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:08:31 - 18:08:46:** Minor refactoring of `validateGstData` to import `message` from `gokwik-ui-kit` and return a success message on successful validation.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:12:15:** The `validateGstData` function was significantly updated. It was refactored to first call a `validateGstData` endpoint and, if successful, then proceed to call a new `setGstData` endpoint. The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was removed.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:36:58:** The `validateGstData` function was simplified again, removing the initial `validateGstData` API call and directly calling `APIEndPoints.setGstData`.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:37:08 - 19:49:29:** Minor adjustments to error handling in `validateGstData` (returning `null` instead of `false` on catch) and how the response data is returned (`response?.data` vs `response`).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:40:** Defined `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` API endpoints, along with a comprehensive list of other dashboard and agent-order related endpoints, including analytics for checkout, website, and discounts.
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:55:43:** Added a new endpoint: `setGstData: '/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set'`. Concurrently, `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` endpoints were removed, indicating a potential change in data fetching strategy or their relocation.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:17:26:** Configured UI elements for checkout customization, including settings for one-click checkout, discount application (showing confetti, disabling discounts), exit popouts (standard vs. capture reasons), and order summary display (showing MRP with strikethrough). It also included functionality for merchant logo uploads with validation.
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:21:00:** No functional code changes were observed, suggesting a minor save or formatting adjustment.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:58:38:** Initial implementation for editing abandoned carts, featuring extensive state management for customer details, addresses, line items, and payment methods. Functions for customer and address creation/fetching (`fetchCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `fetchCustomerAddressess`, `fetchAddress`) and order creation (`createOrder`) were present.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:44:01:** Added `merchant_id` to component scope by using the `getMerchantDetails` selector.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:04:58:** An image import was changed from `sparkle.svg` to `bookinfo.svg` (this change might be a typo in the log path, as `sparkle.svg` was originally in `checkoutElementPage.tsx`). Assuming the log is correct, `BookDownload` was imported.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:21:29:** Additional image imports for `Map` and `BreifCase` were added.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:35:58:** The component's local state (`state`) was extended to include `gstDetails: null`, preparing for GST-related information storage.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:37:00:** The `gokwik-ui-kit` import for `DeleteOutlined` was updated to also include `DeleteFilled`, indicating a possible UI icon change.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:50:59:** The imported image `BookDownload` had its path updated from `bookinfo.svg` to `gstBook.svg`, further supporting the new focus on GST.
    *   Multiple identical timestamps (e.g., between 17:59:26 and 18:07:26, and numerous later entries) for this file suggest frequent saves or minor, non-functional edits (like formatting) not captured in the diff.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **API Centric Development:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around modifying API endpoints and their corresponding utility functions. This suggests an active development phase involving backend integration and data handling.
*   **GST Data Integration:** A clear pattern emerges with the introduction and refinement of `validateGstData` and `setGstData` endpoints and their usage in the `api.ts` utility and the `editAbcCart.tsx` component (by adding `gstDetails` to its state and updating a related image asset). This indicates a new feature or enhancement for handling Goods and Services Tax information.
*   **UI Customization and Configuration:** `checkoutElementPage.tsx` shows continuous efforts in allowing merchants to customize their checkout experience through various toggles and options, including visual elements like logos.
*   **Abandoned Cart Management:** `editAbcCart.tsx` demonstrates ongoing work on the abandoned cart feature, with detailed state management and customer interaction logic.
*   **Frequent Saves/Minor Edits:** The high number of identical or nearly identical code changes across consecutive timestamps for `editAbcCart.tsx` and `checkoutElementPage.tsx` suggests developers are frequently saving their work, possibly using an auto-save feature or making small, iterative changes.
*   **Dependency on `@gokwik/utilities` and `gokwik-ui-kit`:** Both utility and UI components are consistently imported and used, indicating a standardized approach to development within the Gokwik ecosystem.

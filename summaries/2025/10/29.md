# Activity Summary for 29/10/2025

## 11:09:20
The provided log details entries for a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The content of this Dockerfile remains absolutely consistent across all three recorded timestamps. There were no actual code modifications observed within the log entries.

The Dockerfile outlines a standard build process for a Node.js 20 application within an Alpine Linux environment. Key steps include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` via `apk add --no-cache`.
*   Copying `package*.json` first for efficient Docker layer caching.
*   Installing dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application using `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port 3000.
*   Defining `npm start` as the command to run the application.

The file's state was logged at three distinct, closely spaced timestamps: 28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; and 28/10/2025, 12:29:42. These timestamps suggest multiple saves or checks of the same unchanged Dockerfile content within a short timeframe of just over two minutes.

The primary pattern observed is the complete repetition of the Dockerfile's content, indicating that the file's configuration was stable and unchanged across all log entries.

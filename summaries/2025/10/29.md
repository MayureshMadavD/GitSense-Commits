# Activity Summary for 29/10/2025

## 11:09:20
The provided log details entries for a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The content of this Dockerfile remains absolutely consistent across all three recorded timestamps. There were no actual code modifications observed within the log entries.

The Dockerfile outlines a standard build process for a Node.js 20 application within an Alpine Linux environment. Key steps include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` via `apk add --no-cache`.
*   Copying `package*.json` first for efficient Docker layer caching.
*   Installing dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application using `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port 3000.
*   Defining `npm start` as the command to run the application.

The file's state was logged at three distinct, closely spaced timestamps: 28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; and 28/10/2025, 12:29:42. These timestamps suggest multiple saves or checks of the same unchanged Dockerfile content within a short timeframe of just over two minutes.

The primary pattern observed is the complete repetition of the Dockerfile's content, indicating that the file's configuration was stable and unchanged across all log entries.

## 11:09:52
The code changes primarily focus on refining API interactions related to abandoned carts, product/collection fetching, and merchant configurations, with a notable emphasis on GST data handling.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:17:** Introduced core API functions: `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (for searching and filtering active products/collections, including variant mapping), `updateMerchantData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` (for fetching product variant or collection details), and an initial `validateGstData` function.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:08:31 - 18:08:46:** Minor refactoring of `validateGstData` to import `message` from `gokwik-ui-kit` and return a success message on successful validation.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:12:15:** The `validateGstData` function was significantly updated. It was refactored to first call a `validateGstData` endpoint and, if successful, then proceed to call a new `setGstData` endpoint. The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was removed.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:36:58:** The `validateGstData` function was simplified again, removing the initial `validateGstData` API call and directly calling `APIEndPoints.setGstData`.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:37:08 - 19:49:29:** Minor adjustments to error handling in `validateGstData` (returning `null` instead of `false` on catch) and how the response data is returned (`response?.data` vs `response`).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:40:** Defined `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` API endpoints, along with a comprehensive list of other dashboard and agent-order related endpoints, including analytics for checkout, website, and discounts.
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:55:43:** Added a new endpoint: `setGstData: '/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set'`. Concurrently, `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` endpoints were removed, indicating a potential change in data fetching strategy or their relocation.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:17:26:** Configured UI elements for checkout customization, including settings for one-click checkout, discount application (showing confetti, disabling discounts), exit popouts (standard vs. capture reasons), and order summary display (showing MRP with strikethrough). It also included functionality for merchant logo uploads with validation.
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:21:00:** No functional code changes were observed, suggesting a minor save or formatting adjustment.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:58:38:** Initial implementation for editing abandoned carts, featuring extensive state management for customer details, addresses, line items, and payment methods. Functions for customer and address creation/fetching (`fetchCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `fetchCustomerAddressess`, `fetchAddress`) and order creation (`createOrder`) were present.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:44:01:** Added `merchant_id` to component scope by using the `getMerchantDetails` selector.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:04:58:** An image import was changed from `sparkle.svg` to `bookinfo.svg` (this change might be a typo in the log path, as `sparkle.svg` was originally in `checkoutElementPage.tsx`). Assuming the log is correct, `BookDownload` was imported.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:21:29:** Additional image imports for `Map` and `BreifCase` were added.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:35:58:** The component's local state (`state`) was extended to include `gstDetails: null`, preparing for GST-related information storage.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:37:00:** The `gokwik-ui-kit` import for `DeleteOutlined` was updated to also include `DeleteFilled`, indicating a possible UI icon change.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:50:59:** The imported image `BookDownload` had its path updated from `bookinfo.svg` to `gstBook.svg`, further supporting the new focus on GST.
    *   Multiple identical timestamps (e.g., between 17:59:26 and 18:07:26, and numerous later entries) for this file suggest frequent saves or minor, non-functional edits (like formatting) not captured in the diff.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **API Centric Development:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around modifying API endpoints and their corresponding utility functions. This suggests an active development phase involving backend integration and data handling.
*   **GST Data Integration:** A clear pattern emerges with the introduction and refinement of `validateGstData` and `setGstData` endpoints and their usage in the `api.ts` utility and the `editAbcCart.tsx` component (by adding `gstDetails` to its state and updating a related image asset). This indicates a new feature or enhancement for handling Goods and Services Tax information.
*   **UI Customization and Configuration:** `checkoutElementPage.tsx` shows continuous efforts in allowing merchants to customize their checkout experience through various toggles and options, including visual elements like logos.
*   **Abandoned Cart Management:** `editAbcCart.tsx` demonstrates ongoing work on the abandoned cart feature, with detailed state management and customer interaction logic.
*   **Frequent Saves/Minor Edits:** The high number of identical or nearly identical code changes across consecutive timestamps for `editAbcCart.tsx` and `checkoutElementPage.tsx` suggests developers are frequently saving their work, possibly using an auto-save feature or making small, iterative changes.
*   **Dependency on `@gokwik/utilities` and `gokwik-ui-kit`:** Both utility and UI components are consistently imported and used, indicating a standardized approach to development within the Gokwik ecosystem.

## 11:10:01
The code changes primarily revolve around the GoKwik checkout UI, focusing on environment configuration, analytics integration, and merchant-side interaction. Significant modifications were made across two main files and two new files were introduced, all occurring between October 27th and October 29th, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**:
    *   **Recurring Endpoint Changes**: The `api_url` for the `local` environment was frequently toggled between `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` and `https://api.gokwik.co` on October 27th, October 28th, and October 29th. This indicates active development and testing across different API environments.
    *   **Cart Data Updates**: The `setCart` function, used for populating hardcoded cart data in local environments, underwent two significant updates.
        *   On October 28th at 13:29:25, the cart `token`, `note`, `attributes` (adding `LUID`, `SESSION_ID`, `WE_DATA`, `Gokwik`), `total_price`, `item_count`, and product details were completely changed from a single "5 Pocket Jean" to a different item.
        *   Again on October 29th at 11:01:39, the `setCart` function was updated with a new cart `token`, additional `attributes` (`platform_source`, `gb_values`, `client_id`, `ga_session_id`), and new product details for "Lazy Days Brown Oversized Printed Exclusive Shirt" including discount information.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**:
    *   This file, a central point for integrating external analytics, saw several iterative changes focused on debugging and logging.
    *   **Debugging Local Storage Token**: On October 28th, there were multiple additions and removals of a `console.log` statement within the `store_localStorageObject.subscribe` block to display the "Token Is Visible". This suggests active debugging of token retrieval.
    *   **Temporary Skip OTP Logging**: Briefly on October 28th, an import for `store_isSkipOtp` was added along with a `console.log` for its value, which was subsequently removed. This indicates temporary debugging of a "skip OTP" feature.
    *   **Page State Tracking**: `store_page` was imported and a `pageNumber` variable was introduced on October 28th to track the current page, with a `console.log` added to the `store_phoneNo.subscribe` block to correlate phone number events with the current page.
    *   **Final Debugging Removal**: By October 28th at 16:12:33, the `store_isSkipOtp` import and the `store_localStorageObject.subscribe` block were removed, leaving only the `pageNumber` logging in relation to phone number events.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**:
    *   **New File (October 28th, 14:44:14)**: This Svelte component was introduced to manage the merchant-side integration of the GoKwik checkout. Key aspects include:
        *   Loading the GoKwik checkout JavaScript.
        *   Extensive cookie (e.g., `_shopify_s`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`) and URL parameter parsing to gather session and marketing data.
        *   Handling interactions with an embedded iframe, including launching the checkout.
        *   `truecallerConfig` with environment-specific values.
        *   A hardcoded `window.merchantInfo` object for local testing, including merchant ID, environment (`local`), store ID, and Facebook Pixel ID.
        *   Logic for checking available UPI apps and "cash to prepaid" flows.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts`**:
    *   **New File (October 28th, 15:44:07)**: This file was added to specifically handle event tracking and user identification for CleverTap.
        *   It defines a mapping of data keys and functions to construct event payloads for various checkout stages (e.g., `Mobile_Added_GK`, `PIN_Code_Added_GK`, `Payment_Method_Selected_GK`, `GK_Charged`, `User_Address_Added_GK`).
        *   Includes specialized logic for handling "Charged" events with different data structures based on configuration flags and merchant origin (e.g., "levi").

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**:
    *   **New File (October 29th, 11:02:27)**: This HTML file was introduced as a local testing page for the merchant checkout.
        *   It contains a custom JavaScript `gokwikSdk` to initialize and interact with the checkout.
        *   Includes a simple UI form for developers to manually input merchant ID and cart JSON, and select an environment, saving this data to cookies for testing.
        *   Features a hardcoded `window.merchantInfo` object for local development, mirroring the one in `Merchant.svelte`.
        *   Manages setting and retrieving essential cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to simulate user journey data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Local Development Focus**: A strong pattern of local debugging and testing is evident through frequently changed hardcoded cart data, environment URLs, and temporary console logs.
*   **Comprehensive Analytics**: The addition of dedicated analytics files (`ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `CleverTap.ts`) and numerous imports related to various platforms indicate a robust strategy for tracking user behavior and checkout events across multiple services.
*   **Cookie and URL Parameter Dependency**: The system heavily relies on cookies and URL query parameters to propagate crucial information like session IDs, UTM sources, and specific analytics identifiers across different parts of the checkout flow.
*   **Checkout Flow Integration**: The changes highlight a consistent effort to configure, integrate, and debug the GoKwik checkout UI, including environment setup, event tracking, and merchant-side interaction points.

## 12:09:19
The log details changes exclusively for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The Dockerfile is consistently configured to:
*   Utilize `node:20-alpine` as its base image.
*   Set the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
*   Install `openssl` as an essential build tool.
*   Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first for efficient caching of dependencies.
*   Install project dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copy the entire application source code.
*   Generate the Prisma schema via `npx prisma generate`.
*   Build the application using `npm run build`.
*   Expose port `3000`.
*   Start the application with the command `npm start`.

Significant timestamps for this file are 28/10/2025 at 12:27:10, 12:27:41, and 12:29:42. A prominent pattern observed is that the content of the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` remained identical across all three recorded timestamps, indicating no functional changes were introduced to the Dockerfile within these log entries. The timestamps likely represent successive saves or logs of the same Dockerfile configuration.

## 12:10:05
The logs show changes across several files, primarily focusing on analytics and checkout discount management. Files containing environment-specific keys or identifiers have been excluded from this summary.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple changes on 28/10/2025, between 14:40:38 and 16:13:46.
    *   **Key Updates:** This file serves as a central hub for gathering and processing data for various external analytics platforms.
        *   It imports a wide array of Svelte stores (`LoginStore`, `OrderStore`, `CommonStore`) to subscribe to and manage data related to the user's cart, address, payment, discounts, and marketing attributes (e.g., `fbc`, `fbp`, UTM parameters).
        *   It defines several key data structures like `priceBreakup` for financial totals and `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` for mapping Facebook pixel events.
        *   The `configObject` is dynamically built to enable or disable specific analytics pixels and custom events based on merchant configuration, including support for `kwikOptimizerPixelIds` and various Facebook custom events.
        *   Throughout the day, several debugging `console.log` statements were added and subsequently removed or commented out. For instance, temporary logging was introduced to monitor `store_localStorageObject` and `store_isSkipOtp` values.
        *   A `store_page` subscription was added and refined, initially logging a general `Page` variable, which was later renamed to `pageNumber` and its `console.log` moved to provide context during `phoneNoSubmitted` calls, before being removed.
        *   The final changes indicate a cleanup of these temporary debugging artifacts, removing commented-out code and unused imports like `store_isSkipOtp`.

2.  **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts**
    *   **Timestamp:** A single significant change on 28/10/2025, 15:44:07.
    *   **Key Updates:** This file implements the integration for CleverTap analytics.
        *   It defines a mapping (`mappedKey`) to translate internal data attributes (e.g., 'Product ID', 'product price') to CleverTap's expected format.
        *   The `createBody` function structures the event data payload, incorporating common analytics data and event-specific details.
        *   `pushCleverTap` handles the actual event dispatching, with conditional logic to split product arrays into multiple CleverTap events based on configuration.
        *   The `callCleverTap` function acts as a dispatcher for various event types (`phoneNumber`, `paymentCompleted`, `checkoutStarted`), each with a dedicated helper function to prepare and send data to CleverTap.
        *   Special handling exists for user login events (`clevertap.onUserLogin.push`) to update user profiles, and for "Charged" events, including specific data adjustments for certain merchant origins (e.g., 'levi').

3.  **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte**
    *   **Timestamp:** Several very minor updates on 29/10/2025, between 11:24:02 and 11:29:33.
    *   **Key Updates:** This Svelte component is responsible for managing the discount and offer section within the checkout UI.
        *   It extensively imports stores from `CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, and `OrderStore` to control discount application, display, and related UI states (e.g., `store_discountCode`, `store_offers`, `store_totalPrice`, `store_stackedDiscounts`).
        *   It integrates with various services for analytics (`couponListViewed`), general event tracking (`fireGtmEvent`, `logEvent`), and core discount logic (e.g., `discountCall`, `applyCredOffer`, wallet credits, gift cards, TwidPay).
        *   Many local state variables are declared to manage the UI, available coupons, applied discounts, loyalty programs, and feature flags (e.g., `disable_discount_with_credits`, `isExtraAutomaticEnabled`).
        *   Subscriptions to `store_requestIdObject` dynamically configure discount rules, such as preventing discounts with credits or gift cards, and enabling different types of automatic discounts.
        *   The component tracks and displays all applied offers (automatic, stacked, partner-specific) to the user. The repeated timestamps suggest frequent saves with little functional change, possibly minor formatting or build-related updates.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Svelte Store-based State Management:** A prevalent pattern is the use of Svelte stores across components and services to manage application-wide state. Components `subscribe` to these stores to reactively update their local data and UI.
*   **Modular Analytics Integration:** Analytics logic is modularized into specific files (e.g., `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `CleverTap.ts`), each handling data collection and dispatch for different platforms.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Many functionalities, particularly in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `Discounts.svelte`, are driven by dynamic `custom_config` objects retrieved from `store_requestIdObject`. This allows flexible feature toggling and behavior modification without code changes.
*   **Iterative Development and Debugging:** The log for `ForeignAnalytics.ts` shows a common development pattern of adding and removing `console.log` statements for debugging specific store values or variable states during development.
*   **Comprehensive Data Collection:** There's a recurring need to collect extensive user, cart, and marketing data, which is then processed and tailored for various purposes, including display in the UI (discounts) and submission to analytics platforms.

## 12:10:14
The changes log details several updates across a `checkout-dashboard-ui` project, primarily focusing on API utilities, endpoint definitions, and specific UI components. The timestamps indicate active development, with a burst of changes on October 28, 2025.

**Key Information & File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 20:16:17):** This file defined core API helper functions like `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (which handles product/collection search, including filtering for 'active' products and variant mapping), `updateMerchantData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` (for fetching product/collection details), and `validateGstData`.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (28/10/2025, ~18:08 - 19:49):**
        *   The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was completely removed.
        *   The `validateGstData` function underwent several iterations:
            *   It was initially enhanced to show a success message (`message.success`) upon successful GST validation.
            *   It was then refactored to first call a validation endpoint (`APIEndPoints.validateGstData`) and, if successful, then call a separate endpoint to set the GST data (`APIEndPoints.setGstData`).
            *   Further changes simplified `validateGstData` to directly call `APIEndPoints.setGstData` and handle errors by returning `false` or `null`. The return value on success also varied between the full response and `response?.data`.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 20:16:40):** A comprehensive list of API endpoints was defined, covering various modules like orders, customer management, discounts, and analytics. It included endpoints for `getVariantById`, `getCollectionById`, and `validateGstData`.
    *   **Updates (28/10/2025, 17:55:43):**
        *   A new API endpoint, `setGstData: '/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set'`, was added, directly supporting the changes in `api.ts` for GST processing.
        *   The `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` endpoints were removed, consistent with the removal of `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` in the `api.ts` utility file.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 23:17:26):** This React component manages UI customization settings for the checkout page, including configuration for one-click checkout, discount application, exit popouts, and order summary settings. It also includes logic for uploading and managing a line item logo.
    *   **Minor Updates (27/10/2025, 23:21:00):** Only non-functional changes (likely formatting or whitespace adjustments) were observed, indicating minor iterations without altering core logic.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (28/10/2025, 17:58:38):** This React component handles the editing of abandoned carts, involving customer information, shipping addresses, line items, and order creation. It already imported `validateGstData`.
    *   **Functional & UI Enhancements (28/10/2025, ~19:44 - 20:35):**
        *   The `merchant_id` (specifically `m_id`) was introduced using Redux's `useSelector`, implying a more specific merchant ID is now required.
        *   New image assets (`Map` from `marker.svg`, `BreifCase` from `briefcase.svg`) were imported, suggesting UI additions.
        *   The `BookDownload` image import was updated from `bookinfo.svg` to `gstBook.svg`, indicating a visual change related to GST.
        *   A new `gstDetails: null` property was added to the component's state, signifying an intent to manage GST-related information directly within the component.
    *   **Minor UI Dependency Cleanup (28/10/2025, 20:37:00):** The `DeleteOutlined` icon import was removed.
    *   **Frequent Iterations:** This file saw numerous identical entries throughout the day (e.g., between 17:58:38 and 18:07:26, and 19:44:01 and 21:12:19), suggesting continuous development, minor adjustments, or frequent auto-saves during active coding.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/10/2025 (late evening):** Initial setup and development of API utilities and a checkout UI customization page.
*   **28/10/2025 (late afternoon/early evening, ~17:55 - 19:49):** Focused development on API endpoints and utility functions, particularly around GST handling, including the introduction of `setGstData` and the removal of variant/collection detail fetching.
*   **28/10/2025 (evening, ~19:44 - 20:35):** Concurrent development on the abandoned cart editing page, integrating new merchant details, UI elements (icons), and explicitly introducing GST details into the component's state.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **GST Feature Integration:** A prominent theme is the ongoing development and refinement of GST (Goods and Services Tax) related functionality. This is evident through the addition of a `setGstData` API endpoint, the refactoring of `validateGstData` to leverage this new endpoint, the introduction of a `gstDetails` state variable in the abandoned cart component, and a specific `gstBook.svg` image asset.
*   **API Layer Evolution:** Changes in `api.ts` and `apiEndpoints.ts` are closely coupled, showing a coordinated effort to adapt the data interaction layer. This includes the removal of old, unused API calls/endpoints (`getVariantById`, `getCollectionById`) and the introduction of new ones (`setGstData`).
*   **UI Enhancement and State Management:** Updates to `editAbcCart.tsx` suggest an expansion of the user interface with new visual elements and a more comprehensive state management for critical data like `gstDetails`.
*   **Standardized API Interaction:** The consistent use of `makeAPICall` and `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` demonstrates a standardized approach for all API communications across the application.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The frequent, often non-functional, saves in the logs for UI components suggest a highly active development phase with continuous integration or frequent local saves.

## 13:09:19
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The Dockerfile content remained entirely consistent across all three logged entries. It defines a multi-stage build process for a Node.js 20 Alpine application. Key steps include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` build tools.
*   Copying `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for dependency installation.
*   Installing dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application with `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port `3000`.
*   Starting the application with `npm start`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
There are no actual content changes recorded, but the timestamps indicate activity around the Dockerfile on `28/10/2025` between `12:27:10` and `12:29:42`. The timestamps are:
*   `28/10/2025, 12:27:10`
*   `28/10/2025, 12:27:41`
*   `28/10/2025, 12:29:42`
These represent three distinct saves or commits of the *same* Dockerfile version within a span of approximately two and a half minutes.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The most significant pattern is the absolute identity of the Dockerfile content across all entries. This suggests that the same Dockerfile configuration was repeatedly recorded, possibly due to multiple save operations without modifications, or a re-committing of the same version of the file. The Dockerfile itself follows a standard pattern for building Node.js applications with Prisma in a Docker container.

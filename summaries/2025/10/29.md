# Activity Summary for 29/10/2025

## 11:09:20
The provided log details entries for a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The content of this Dockerfile remains absolutely consistent across all three recorded timestamps. There were no actual code modifications observed within the log entries.

The Dockerfile outlines a standard build process for a Node.js 20 application within an Alpine Linux environment. Key steps include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` via `apk add --no-cache`.
*   Copying `package*.json` first for efficient Docker layer caching.
*   Installing dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application using `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port 3000.
*   Defining `npm start` as the command to run the application.

The file's state was logged at three distinct, closely spaced timestamps: 28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; and 28/10/2025, 12:29:42. These timestamps suggest multiple saves or checks of the same unchanged Dockerfile content within a short timeframe of just over two minutes.

The primary pattern observed is the complete repetition of the Dockerfile's content, indicating that the file's configuration was stable and unchanged across all log entries.

## 11:09:52
The code changes primarily focus on refining API interactions related to abandoned carts, product/collection fetching, and merchant configurations, with a notable emphasis on GST data handling.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:17:** Introduced core API functions: `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (for searching and filtering active products/collections, including variant mapping), `updateMerchantData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` (for fetching product variant or collection details), and an initial `validateGstData` function.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:08:31 - 18:08:46:** Minor refactoring of `validateGstData` to import `message` from `gokwik-ui-kit` and return a success message on successful validation.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:12:15:** The `validateGstData` function was significantly updated. It was refactored to first call a `validateGstData` endpoint and, if successful, then proceed to call a new `setGstData` endpoint. The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was removed.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:36:58:** The `validateGstData` function was simplified again, removing the initial `validateGstData` API call and directly calling `APIEndPoints.setGstData`.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:37:08 - 19:49:29:** Minor adjustments to error handling in `validateGstData` (returning `null` instead of `false` on catch) and how the response data is returned (`response?.data` vs `response`).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:40:** Defined `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` API endpoints, along with a comprehensive list of other dashboard and agent-order related endpoints, including analytics for checkout, website, and discounts.
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:55:43:** Added a new endpoint: `setGstData: '/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set'`. Concurrently, `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` endpoints were removed, indicating a potential change in data fetching strategy or their relocation.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:17:26:** Configured UI elements for checkout customization, including settings for one-click checkout, discount application (showing confetti, disabling discounts), exit popouts (standard vs. capture reasons), and order summary display (showing MRP with strikethrough). It also included functionality for merchant logo uploads with validation.
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:21:00:** No functional code changes were observed, suggesting a minor save or formatting adjustment.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:58:38:** Initial implementation for editing abandoned carts, featuring extensive state management for customer details, addresses, line items, and payment methods. Functions for customer and address creation/fetching (`fetchCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `fetchCustomerAddressess`, `fetchAddress`) and order creation (`createOrder`) were present.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:44:01:** Added `merchant_id` to component scope by using the `getMerchantDetails` selector.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:04:58:** An image import was changed from `sparkle.svg` to `bookinfo.svg` (this change might be a typo in the log path, as `sparkle.svg` was originally in `checkoutElementPage.tsx`). Assuming the log is correct, `BookDownload` was imported.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:21:29:** Additional image imports for `Map` and `BreifCase` were added.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:35:58:** The component's local state (`state`) was extended to include `gstDetails: null`, preparing for GST-related information storage.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:37:00:** The `gokwik-ui-kit` import for `DeleteOutlined` was updated to also include `DeleteFilled`, indicating a possible UI icon change.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:50:59:** The imported image `BookDownload` had its path updated from `bookinfo.svg` to `gstBook.svg`, further supporting the new focus on GST.
    *   Multiple identical timestamps (e.g., between 17:59:26 and 18:07:26, and numerous later entries) for this file suggest frequent saves or minor, non-functional edits (like formatting) not captured in the diff.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **API Centric Development:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around modifying API endpoints and their corresponding utility functions. This suggests an active development phase involving backend integration and data handling.
*   **GST Data Integration:** A clear pattern emerges with the introduction and refinement of `validateGstData` and `setGstData` endpoints and their usage in the `api.ts` utility and the `editAbcCart.tsx` component (by adding `gstDetails` to its state and updating a related image asset). This indicates a new feature or enhancement for handling Goods and Services Tax information.
*   **UI Customization and Configuration:** `checkoutElementPage.tsx` shows continuous efforts in allowing merchants to customize their checkout experience through various toggles and options, including visual elements like logos.
*   **Abandoned Cart Management:** `editAbcCart.tsx` demonstrates ongoing work on the abandoned cart feature, with detailed state management and customer interaction logic.
*   **Frequent Saves/Minor Edits:** The high number of identical or nearly identical code changes across consecutive timestamps for `editAbcCart.tsx` and `checkoutElementPage.tsx` suggests developers are frequently saving their work, possibly using an auto-save feature or making small, iterative changes.
*   **Dependency on `@gokwik/utilities` and `gokwik-ui-kit`:** Both utility and UI components are consistently imported and used, indicating a standardized approach to development within the Gokwik ecosystem.

## 11:10:01
The code changes primarily revolve around the GoKwik checkout UI, focusing on environment configuration, analytics integration, and merchant-side interaction. Significant modifications were made across two main files and two new files were introduced, all occurring between October 27th and October 29th, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**:
    *   **Recurring Endpoint Changes**: The `api_url` for the `local` environment was frequently toggled between `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` and `https://api.gokwik.co` on October 27th, October 28th, and October 29th. This indicates active development and testing across different API environments.
    *   **Cart Data Updates**: The `setCart` function, used for populating hardcoded cart data in local environments, underwent two significant updates.
        *   On October 28th at 13:29:25, the cart `token`, `note`, `attributes` (adding `LUID`, `SESSION_ID`, `WE_DATA`, `Gokwik`), `total_price`, `item_count`, and product details were completely changed from a single "5 Pocket Jean" to a different item.
        *   Again on October 29th at 11:01:39, the `setCart` function was updated with a new cart `token`, additional `attributes` (`platform_source`, `gb_values`, `client_id`, `ga_session_id`), and new product details for "Lazy Days Brown Oversized Printed Exclusive Shirt" including discount information.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**:
    *   This file, a central point for integrating external analytics, saw several iterative changes focused on debugging and logging.
    *   **Debugging Local Storage Token**: On October 28th, there were multiple additions and removals of a `console.log` statement within the `store_localStorageObject.subscribe` block to display the "Token Is Visible". This suggests active debugging of token retrieval.
    *   **Temporary Skip OTP Logging**: Briefly on October 28th, an import for `store_isSkipOtp` was added along with a `console.log` for its value, which was subsequently removed. This indicates temporary debugging of a "skip OTP" feature.
    *   **Page State Tracking**: `store_page` was imported and a `pageNumber` variable was introduced on October 28th to track the current page, with a `console.log` added to the `store_phoneNo.subscribe` block to correlate phone number events with the current page.
    *   **Final Debugging Removal**: By October 28th at 16:12:33, the `store_isSkipOtp` import and the `store_localStorageObject.subscribe` block were removed, leaving only the `pageNumber` logging in relation to phone number events.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**:
    *   **New File (October 28th, 14:44:14)**: This Svelte component was introduced to manage the merchant-side integration of the GoKwik checkout. Key aspects include:
        *   Loading the GoKwik checkout JavaScript.
        *   Extensive cookie (e.g., `_shopify_s`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`) and URL parameter parsing to gather session and marketing data.
        *   Handling interactions with an embedded iframe, including launching the checkout.
        *   `truecallerConfig` with environment-specific values.
        *   A hardcoded `window.merchantInfo` object for local testing, including merchant ID, environment (`local`), store ID, and Facebook Pixel ID.
        *   Logic for checking available UPI apps and "cash to prepaid" flows.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts`**:
    *   **New File (October 28th, 15:44:07)**: This file was added to specifically handle event tracking and user identification for CleverTap.
        *   It defines a mapping of data keys and functions to construct event payloads for various checkout stages (e.g., `Mobile_Added_GK`, `PIN_Code_Added_GK`, `Payment_Method_Selected_GK`, `GK_Charged`, `User_Address_Added_GK`).
        *   Includes specialized logic for handling "Charged" events with different data structures based on configuration flags and merchant origin (e.g., "levi").

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**:
    *   **New File (October 29th, 11:02:27)**: This HTML file was introduced as a local testing page for the merchant checkout.
        *   It contains a custom JavaScript `gokwikSdk` to initialize and interact with the checkout.
        *   Includes a simple UI form for developers to manually input merchant ID and cart JSON, and select an environment, saving this data to cookies for testing.
        *   Features a hardcoded `window.merchantInfo` object for local development, mirroring the one in `Merchant.svelte`.
        *   Manages setting and retrieving essential cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to simulate user journey data.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Local Development Focus**: A strong pattern of local debugging and testing is evident through frequently changed hardcoded cart data, environment URLs, and temporary console logs.
*   **Comprehensive Analytics**: The addition of dedicated analytics files (`ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `CleverTap.ts`) and numerous imports related to various platforms indicate a robust strategy for tracking user behavior and checkout events across multiple services.
*   **Cookie and URL Parameter Dependency**: The system heavily relies on cookies and URL query parameters to propagate crucial information like session IDs, UTM sources, and specific analytics identifiers across different parts of the checkout flow.
*   **Checkout Flow Integration**: The changes highlight a consistent effort to configure, integrate, and debug the GoKwik checkout UI, including environment setup, event tracking, and merchant-side interaction points.

## 12:09:19
The log details changes exclusively for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The Dockerfile is consistently configured to:
*   Utilize `node:20-alpine` as its base image.
*   Set the working directory inside the container to `/app`.
*   Install `openssl` as an essential build tool.
*   Copy `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first for efficient caching of dependencies.
*   Install project dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copy the entire application source code.
*   Generate the Prisma schema via `npx prisma generate`.
*   Build the application using `npm run build`.
*   Expose port `3000`.
*   Start the application with the command `npm start`.

Significant timestamps for this file are 28/10/2025 at 12:27:10, 12:27:41, and 12:29:42. A prominent pattern observed is that the content of the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` remained identical across all three recorded timestamps, indicating no functional changes were introduced to the Dockerfile within these log entries. The timestamps likely represent successive saves or logs of the same Dockerfile configuration.

## 12:10:05
The logs show changes across several files, primarily focusing on analytics and checkout discount management. Files containing environment-specific keys or identifiers have been excluded from this summary.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts**
    *   **Timestamp:** Multiple changes on 28/10/2025, between 14:40:38 and 16:13:46.
    *   **Key Updates:** This file serves as a central hub for gathering and processing data for various external analytics platforms.
        *   It imports a wide array of Svelte stores (`LoginStore`, `OrderStore`, `CommonStore`) to subscribe to and manage data related to the user's cart, address, payment, discounts, and marketing attributes (e.g., `fbc`, `fbp`, UTM parameters).
        *   It defines several key data structures like `priceBreakup` for financial totals and `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` for mapping Facebook pixel events.
        *   The `configObject` is dynamically built to enable or disable specific analytics pixels and custom events based on merchant configuration, including support for `kwikOptimizerPixelIds` and various Facebook custom events.
        *   Throughout the day, several debugging `console.log` statements were added and subsequently removed or commented out. For instance, temporary logging was introduced to monitor `store_localStorageObject` and `store_isSkipOtp` values.
        *   A `store_page` subscription was added and refined, initially logging a general `Page` variable, which was later renamed to `pageNumber` and its `console.log` moved to provide context during `phoneNoSubmitted` calls, before being removed.
        *   The final changes indicate a cleanup of these temporary debugging artifacts, removing commented-out code and unused imports like `store_isSkipOtp`.

2.  **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts**
    *   **Timestamp:** A single significant change on 28/10/2025, 15:44:07.
    *   **Key Updates:** This file implements the integration for CleverTap analytics.
        *   It defines a mapping (`mappedKey`) to translate internal data attributes (e.g., 'Product ID', 'product price') to CleverTap's expected format.
        *   The `createBody` function structures the event data payload, incorporating common analytics data and event-specific details.
        *   `pushCleverTap` handles the actual event dispatching, with conditional logic to split product arrays into multiple CleverTap events based on configuration.
        *   The `callCleverTap` function acts as a dispatcher for various event types (`phoneNumber`, `paymentCompleted`, `checkoutStarted`), each with a dedicated helper function to prepare and send data to CleverTap.
        *   Special handling exists for user login events (`clevertap.onUserLogin.push`) to update user profiles, and for "Charged" events, including specific data adjustments for certain merchant origins (e.g., 'levi').

3.  **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte**
    *   **Timestamp:** Several very minor updates on 29/10/2025, between 11:24:02 and 11:29:33.
    *   **Key Updates:** This Svelte component is responsible for managing the discount and offer section within the checkout UI.
        *   It extensively imports stores from `CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, and `OrderStore` to control discount application, display, and related UI states (e.g., `store_discountCode`, `store_offers`, `store_totalPrice`, `store_stackedDiscounts`).
        *   It integrates with various services for analytics (`couponListViewed`), general event tracking (`fireGtmEvent`, `logEvent`), and core discount logic (e.g., `discountCall`, `applyCredOffer`, wallet credits, gift cards, TwidPay).
        *   Many local state variables are declared to manage the UI, available coupons, applied discounts, loyalty programs, and feature flags (e.g., `disable_discount_with_credits`, `isExtraAutomaticEnabled`).
        *   Subscriptions to `store_requestIdObject` dynamically configure discount rules, such as preventing discounts with credits or gift cards, and enabling different types of automatic discounts.
        *   The component tracks and displays all applied offers (automatic, stacked, partner-specific) to the user. The repeated timestamps suggest frequent saves with little functional change, possibly minor formatting or build-related updates.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Svelte Store-based State Management:** A prevalent pattern is the use of Svelte stores across components and services to manage application-wide state. Components `subscribe` to these stores to reactively update their local data and UI.
*   **Modular Analytics Integration:** Analytics logic is modularized into specific files (e.g., `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `CleverTap.ts`), each handling data collection and dispatch for different platforms.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Many functionalities, particularly in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `Discounts.svelte`, are driven by dynamic `custom_config` objects retrieved from `store_requestIdObject`. This allows flexible feature toggling and behavior modification without code changes.
*   **Iterative Development and Debugging:** The log for `ForeignAnalytics.ts` shows a common development pattern of adding and removing `console.log` statements for debugging specific store values or variable states during development.
*   **Comprehensive Data Collection:** There's a recurring need to collect extensive user, cart, and marketing data, which is then processed and tailored for various purposes, including display in the UI (discounts) and submission to analytics platforms.

## 12:10:14
The changes log details several updates across a `checkout-dashboard-ui` project, primarily focusing on API utilities, endpoint definitions, and specific UI components. The timestamps indicate active development, with a burst of changes on October 28, 2025.

**Key Information & File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 20:16:17):** This file defined core API helper functions like `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (which handles product/collection search, including filtering for 'active' products and variant mapping), `updateMerchantData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` (for fetching product/collection details), and `validateGstData`.
    *   **Significant Refactoring (28/10/2025, ~18:08 - 19:49):**
        *   The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was completely removed.
        *   The `validateGstData` function underwent several iterations:
            *   It was initially enhanced to show a success message (`message.success`) upon successful GST validation.
            *   It was then refactored to first call a validation endpoint (`APIEndPoints.validateGstData`) and, if successful, then call a separate endpoint to set the GST data (`APIEndPoints.setGstData`).
            *   Further changes simplified `validateGstData` to directly call `APIEndPoints.setGstData` and handle errors by returning `false` or `null`. The return value on success also varied between the full response and `response?.data`.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 20:16:40):** A comprehensive list of API endpoints was defined, covering various modules like orders, customer management, discounts, and analytics. It included endpoints for `getVariantById`, `getCollectionById`, and `validateGstData`.
    *   **Updates (28/10/2025, 17:55:43):**
        *   A new API endpoint, `setGstData: '/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set'`, was added, directly supporting the changes in `api.ts` for GST processing.
        *   The `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` endpoints were removed, consistent with the removal of `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` in the `api.ts` utility file.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 23:17:26):** This React component manages UI customization settings for the checkout page, including configuration for one-click checkout, discount application, exit popouts, and order summary settings. It also includes logic for uploading and managing a line item logo.
    *   **Minor Updates (27/10/2025, 23:21:00):** Only non-functional changes (likely formatting or whitespace adjustments) were observed, indicating minor iterations without altering core logic.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (28/10/2025, 17:58:38):** This React component handles the editing of abandoned carts, involving customer information, shipping addresses, line items, and order creation. It already imported `validateGstData`.
    *   **Functional & UI Enhancements (28/10/2025, ~19:44 - 20:35):**
        *   The `merchant_id` (specifically `m_id`) was introduced using Redux's `useSelector`, implying a more specific merchant ID is now required.
        *   New image assets (`Map` from `marker.svg`, `BreifCase` from `briefcase.svg`) were imported, suggesting UI additions.
        *   The `BookDownload` image import was updated from `bookinfo.svg` to `gstBook.svg`, indicating a visual change related to GST.
        *   A new `gstDetails: null` property was added to the component's state, signifying an intent to manage GST-related information directly within the component.
    *   **Minor UI Dependency Cleanup (28/10/2025, 20:37:00):** The `DeleteOutlined` icon import was removed.
    *   **Frequent Iterations:** This file saw numerous identical entries throughout the day (e.g., between 17:58:38 and 18:07:26, and 19:44:01 and 21:12:19), suggesting continuous development, minor adjustments, or frequent auto-saves during active coding.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/10/2025 (late evening):** Initial setup and development of API utilities and a checkout UI customization page.
*   **28/10/2025 (late afternoon/early evening, ~17:55 - 19:49):** Focused development on API endpoints and utility functions, particularly around GST handling, including the introduction of `setGstData` and the removal of variant/collection detail fetching.
*   **28/10/2025 (evening, ~19:44 - 20:35):** Concurrent development on the abandoned cart editing page, integrating new merchant details, UI elements (icons), and explicitly introducing GST details into the component's state.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **GST Feature Integration:** A prominent theme is the ongoing development and refinement of GST (Goods and Services Tax) related functionality. This is evident through the addition of a `setGstData` API endpoint, the refactoring of `validateGstData` to leverage this new endpoint, the introduction of a `gstDetails` state variable in the abandoned cart component, and a specific `gstBook.svg` image asset.
*   **API Layer Evolution:** Changes in `api.ts` and `apiEndpoints.ts` are closely coupled, showing a coordinated effort to adapt the data interaction layer. This includes the removal of old, unused API calls/endpoints (`getVariantById`, `getCollectionById`) and the introduction of new ones (`setGstData`).
*   **UI Enhancement and State Management:** Updates to `editAbcCart.tsx` suggest an expansion of the user interface with new visual elements and a more comprehensive state management for critical data like `gstDetails`.
*   **Standardized API Interaction:** The consistent use of `makeAPICall` and `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` demonstrates a standardized approach for all API communications across the application.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The frequent, often non-functional, saves in the logs for UI components suggest a highly active development phase with continuous integration or frequent local saves.

## 13:09:19
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The Dockerfile content remained entirely consistent across all three logged entries. It defines a multi-stage build process for a Node.js 20 Alpine application. Key steps include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` build tools.
*   Copying `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for dependency installation.
*   Installing dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application with `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port `3000`.
*   Starting the application with `npm start`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
There are no actual content changes recorded, but the timestamps indicate activity around the Dockerfile on `28/10/2025` between `12:27:10` and `12:29:42`. The timestamps are:
*   `28/10/2025, 12:27:10`
*   `28/10/2025, 12:27:41`
*   `28/10/2025, 12:29:42`
These represent three distinct saves or commits of the *same* Dockerfile version within a span of approximately two and a half minutes.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The most significant pattern is the absolute identity of the Dockerfile content across all entries. This suggests that the same Dockerfile configuration was repeatedly recorded, possibly due to multiple save operations without modifications, or a re-committing of the same version of the file. The Dockerfile itself follows a standard pattern for building Node.js applications with Prisma in a Docker container.

## 13:10:06
The code changes primarily focus on the development and refinement of a GST (Goods and Services Tax) feature within the checkout dashboard, alongside minor UI adjustments and API endpoint expansions.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:17**: This file initially defined API utility functions, including `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` for product/collection search, `updateMerchantData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` for fetching product variant/collection details, and a basic `validateGstData` API call.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:08:31 - 18:08:46**: The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was removed, and the `validateGstData` function was updated to import `message` from `gokwik-ui-kit` to show a success message upon successful GST validation.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:12:15**: `validateGstData` underwent a significant refactor. It was initially designed to perform a validation call (`APIEndPoints.validateGstData`) followed by a data setting call (`APIEndPoints.setGstData`) if validation passed. It also added a `try-catch` block, returning `false` on error.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:36:58 - 19:49:29**: Further iterations on `validateGstData` simplified its logic. The explicit `validateGstData` API call was removed, and the function now directly calls `APIEndPoints.setGstData`. The error handling was updated to return `null` on failure, and the return value fluctuated between the full response object and just its `data` property, eventually settling on returning the full `response` object.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:40**: This file provided a comprehensive list of API endpoints for various dashboard features.
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:55:43**: A new API endpoint, `setGstData: '/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set'`, was added. This addition directly correlates with the changes made in the `api.ts` file for handling GST data.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:58:38**: The component manages abandoned cart details, including customer information, addresses, line items, discounts, and payment methods. It imports `validateGstData` from the utility API, indicating an intention to integrate GST validation.
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:44:01**: The `merchant_id` was added to be extracted from the Redux store, suggesting its use in API calls or other merchant-specific logic within this component.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:21:29 - 20:35:58**: New SVG icons (`Map` from `marker.svg` and `BreifCase` from `briefcase.svg`) were added, and the initial `BookDownload` SVG import path changed. Crucially, `gstDetails: null` was added to the component's state, directly reflecting the ongoing GST feature integration.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:37:00**: An import for `DeleteFilled` UI component was added.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:56:59**: The `BookDownload` SVG import path was updated to `gstBook.svg`, further emphasizing the GST-related UI elements.
    *   Multiple timestamps between `28/10/2025, 17:59:26` and `28/10/2025, 21:12:19` show no discernible functional changes, suggesting frequent saves, reformatting, or very minor, unlogged edits.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/10/2025, Evening (20:16:17 - 23:21:00)**: Initial development/setup of API utilities and a UI customization page.
*   **28/10/2025, Afternoon/Evening (17:55:43 - 21:12:19)**: Intensive development around GST integration, starting with API endpoint definition (`setGstData`), followed by continuous refactoring of the `validateGstData` function, and concurrent updates to the `editAbcCart.tsx` component to include GST-related state and UI elements.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **GST Feature Development:** The most prominent pattern is the iterative development of a GST functionality, involving new API endpoints, refactored API utility functions, and new state management in a UI component. This indicates a concentrated effort to implement or enhance GST handling.
*   **API-Centric Logic:** Changes in `api.ts` and `apiEndpoints.ts` demonstrate a reliance on dedicated API calls for specific functionalities like product search, merchant data updates, and especially for GST validation/setting.
*   **Modular UI Components:** The `checkoutElementPage.tsx` and `editAbcCart.tsx` files show the use of separate UI components (e.g., `ProductSearch`, `InfoComponent`, `ColorPicketComponent`, `TrustBadgeForm`) and custom hooks (`useMerchantConfigApi`) for managing complex UI logic and state.
*   **Frequent Commits/Saves:** The numerous identical code entries for `editAbcCart.tsx` over a short period suggest a very active development workflow, possibly involving minor edits, formatting, or frequent saves without substantial functional changes in each logged instance.
*   **Image Resource Management:** The updates include changes to SVG image imports (`BookDownload` path change, adding `Map` and `BreifCase`), implying visual enhancements or new icons related to the features being built.

## 13:10:17
This log details several changes across common services and UI components within a checkout UI project, primarily focusing on environment configurations, analytics integrations, and discount management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**: This file manages API endpoints and other environment-specific configurations.
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:32:07 and 28/10/2025, 13:28:57**: The `api_url` for the `local` environment was set to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`.
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:32:18 and 29/10/2025, 11:01:51**: The `api_url` for the `local` environment was updated to `https://api.gokwik.co`. This URL for the local environment frequently changes between these two endpoints.
    *   **28/10/2025, 13:29:25**: The `setCart` function was significantly updated with new, hardcoded cart JSON data. This update included a different cart token, added various new attributes (`LUID`, `SESSION_ID`, `WE_DATA`, `Gokwik`), and changed the cart content to include two distinct product items with updated prices and details.
    *   **29/10/2025, 11:01:39**: The `setCart` function received another major update, replacing the cart JSON with new product data, a different token, and modified attributes (`platform_source`, `gb_values`, `client_id`, `ga_session_id`).
    *   The file defines functions (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that return environment-dependent session and pass tokens as string literals.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**: This service handles integrations with various third-party analytics platforms.
    *   **28/10/2025, 14:40:38**: A substantial update added numerous imports from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` (e.g., `store_gstInfo`, `store_shopifyCookieInfo`, `store_fbExternalId`). New variables were introduced for detailed tracking (`google_ads_enhanced_tracking`, `countryCode`, `priceBreakup` components). A `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` object was defined for Facebook event mapping, and several helper functions (`checkSnapchatPixel`, `prefilledAddress`, `adSourceMapping`) were added. The `store_requestIdObject` subscription was expanded to extract more configuration, and the `store_foreignAnalytics` subscription was updated to handle `kwikOptimizerPixelIds` and custom Facebook events.
    *   **28/10/2025, 15:13:09, 15:22:05, 15:23:42, 15:51:04, 15:51:29, 15:54:40, 15:54:59, 16:09:27, 16:12:33**: Multiple smaller changes involved adding, commenting out, and then removing debugging `console.log` statements related to `store_localStorageObject`, `store_isSkipOtp`, and `store_page` subscriptions. This indicates active development and troubleshooting.
    *   **29/10/2025, 12:47:42**: The file entered a merge conflict state, indicating concurrent development. This included adding subscriptions for `store_priceBreakUp` and `store_ppCodAmount`, and re-introducing the `store_page` subscription.
    *   **29/10/2025, 12:48:14**: The merge conflict was resolved, cleanly integrating `store_ppCodAmount` and `store_priceBreakUp` subscriptions, and ensuring the `store_page` subscription was correctly handled.
    *   **29/10/2025, 12:54:00**: A minor refactoring moved variable declarations for `mobileApp`, `isPpcod`, and `isTotalPayableAmount` onto a single line.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**: This Svelte component is likely a core part of the merchant-facing UI.
    *   **28/10/2025, 14:44:14**: This update introduced a wide array of new analytics service imports (e.g., CleverTap, Klaviyo, GA4, Snapchat, Google Ads). It added numerous variables for tracking, cookie management, and merchant information (`shopifySessionId`, `fbExternalId`, `kwikpass_user_token`). The `truecallerConfig` was updated for `dev` and `ndev` environments, and `sessionIDFixMerchants` was introduced. The `onMount` hook was expanded to process URL query parameters, read/set cookies, and handle messages from a potential iframe or external script, indicating robust integration with the checkout process and analytics. Initial page loading and cookie setting logic for `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` were also added.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts`**: This file specifically handles CleverTap analytics events.
    *   **28/10/2025, 15:44:07**: This major update introduced `keysToConvert` and `mappedKey` for data transformation and a `replacedItems` helper. The `pushCleverTap` function was modified to support splitting product arrays for events. All core CleverTap event functions were defined or updated to send detailed event data, including product information, marketing data (UTM parameters), user address, and abandoned cart URLs, covering various stages of the checkout flow.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**: This Svelte component manages the discount application and display logic.
    *   **29/10/2025, 11:24:02**: This significant update expanded imports for new stores (e.g., `store_paymentsGeneralConfig`, `store_exitPopupFlow`) and added new variables (`cashbackData`, `showShimmer`, `bestDiscount`). The logic for `allAppliedOffers` became much more sophisticated, dynamically constructing a list of active discounts from various sources (automatic, stacked, single coupons, partner offers like Cred), including conditional rendering and removal functions. The `onMount` hook was updated to extract dynamic discount configurations from `store_requestIdObject` and refine `allowDiscountApplication` logic based on stacked discounts.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Enhanced Analytics Integration**: A primary focus across multiple files (ForeignAnalytics, Merchant.svelte, CleverTap.ts) is the expansion and refinement of analytics tracking. This includes integrating with a wider range of platforms, capturing more granular data points at different checkout stages, and improving data mapping and attribution (e.g., UTM parameters).
*   **Environment-Dependent Logic**: The consistent modification of `EnvironmentService.ts` demonstrates an ongoing need to configure API endpoints and other settings dynamically based on the deployment environment, particularly for local development.
*   **Increased Checkout Complexity**: The updates to `Merchant.svelte` and `Discounts.svelte` indicate a growing sophistication in handling the checkout process, particularly around discount application (e.g., stacking, automatic discounts) and session management through cookies and URL parameters.
*   **Iterative Development and Debugging**: The frequent addition and subsequent removal or commenting out of `console.log` statements in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` points to an active, iterative development and debugging workflow.
*   **State Management**: A strong reliance on Svelte stores (`store_cartjsObject`, `store_requestIdObject`, etc.) is evident for managing global application state and configurations, enabling different components and services to react to data changes.
*   **Hardcoded Test Data**: The repeated updates to hardcoded cart data in `EnvironmentService.ts` suggest a rigorous testing approach for various cart scenarios in different environments.

## 14:09:20
The provided log details changes exclusively for the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`. This file was logged at three distinct timestamps: 28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; and 28/10/2025, 12:29:42.

**Key Information:**
*   **File-specific updates:** There were no actual content changes to the `Dockerfile` across any of the logged entries. The code remained identical in all three snapshots.
*   **Timestamps of significant changes:** Since the file content did not change, these timestamps indicate logging events or saves rather than modifications. The logged state of the Dockerfile was consistent from 12:27:10 to 12:29:42 on 28/10/2025.
*   **Patterns/Recurring elements in content:** The entire Dockerfile content is a recurring element, appearing identically in all entries. It defines a multi-stage build process for a Node.js application:
    *   Uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
    *   Sets the working directory to `/app`.
    *   Installs `openssl` via `apk`.
    *   Copies `package*.json` files first for efficient caching.
    *   Installs dependencies using `npm install -f`.
    *   Copies the remaining application source code.
    *   Generates the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
    *   Builds the application using `npm run build`.
    *   Exposes port `3000`.
    *   Starts the application with `npm start`.

In summary, the logs indicate that a Dockerfile for a Node.js application with Prisma was consistently present in the directory, without any modifications, over a period of approximately two and a half minutes on 28th October 2025.

## 14:10:09
The code changes primarily focus on refining API interactions, enhancing UI customization, and extending functionality within an abandoned cart editing page.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 20:16:17):** This file provided core API utility functions, including `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (which filters active products and maps variants), `updateMerchantData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` (mapping product/collection data), and an initial `validateGstData` function.
    *   **GST Validation Evolution (28/10/2025, 18:08:31 - 19:49:29):** The `validateGstData` function underwent significant modifications:
        *   Initially, it was enhanced to display a success message (`message.success`) on successful validation.
        *   Subsequently, its logic was altered to perform a two-step process: first validate GST data, and if successful, then "set" the GST data via a separate API endpoint (`APIEndPoints.setGstData`), wrapped in a `try...catch` block. The `message.success` call was removed.
        *   Later, the explicit "validation" API call (`APIEndPoints.validateGstData`) was removed, making the function primarily responsible for "setting" GST data via `APIEndPoints.setGstData`, despite retaining the `validateGstData` name. The return value in the catch block was changed from `false` to `null`, and the success return value fluctuated between the full response and just the `response?.data`.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 20:16:40):** This file defined a comprehensive list of API endpoints. Key additions at this time included `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` (used by `api.ts`), and a new `diyDiscounts` section with various endpoints for Shopify discounts and collections.
    *   **GST Endpoint Addition (28/10/2025, 17:55:43):** A new endpoint, `setGstData: '/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set'`, was added. This directly correlates with the changes observed in `api.ts` regarding GST data handling.
    *   **Discrepancy Note:** While `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById` were present at `27/10/2025, 20:16:40`, they appear absent in the log for `28/10/2025, 17:55:43`. However, the `api.ts` file continued to reference these endpoints in `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` throughout the provided log entries, suggesting a potential inconsistency in the logged state of `apiEndpoints.ts`.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx`**
    *   **Feature Management (27/10/2025, 23:17:26):** This page handles UI customization for checkout elements, including settings for one-click checkout, discount application (e.g., "disable discounts application," "show confetti"), exit popouts (standard vs. capture reasons), and order summary display (e.g., "show MRP").
    *   **Logo Upload Functionality:** It includes client-side image validation (`validateUpload`), image cleaning (`cleanImageWithCanvas`), and secure S3 uploads using presigned URLs (`APIEndPoints.presingedLogoUrl` and `APIEndPoints.downloadLogo`).
    *   **Minor Updates (27/10/2025, 23:21:00):** A minor change occurred, but the code content remained identical, likely a re-save or formatting adjustment.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **Core Functionality (28/10/2025, 17:58:38):** This component is responsible for editing abandoned cart details. It manages extensive state related to customer information, addresses, line items, discounts, and payment flows (COD, PPCOD-UPI). It heavily relies on API calls for fetching and creating customer/address data.
    *   **Merchant ID Addition (28/10/2025, 19:44:01):** The `merchant_id` (specifically `m_id`) was added to the component's scope, indicating a potential need for both the standard `merchantId` and `m_id` for operations.
    *   **Image Imports & State Expansion (28/10/2025, 20:04:58 - 20:56:59):**
        *   Multiple image imports were added for UI elements: `BookDownload` (initially from `bookinfo.svg`, later updated to `gstBook.svg`), `Map`, and `BreifCase`.
        *   The component's local state was expanded to include `gstDetails: null`, showing an intention to store and manage GST-related information within the abandoned cart editing process.
    *   **UI Kit Imports (28/10/2025, 20:37:00):** `DeleteFilled` icon was explicitly imported from `gokwik-ui-kit`, indicating UI enhancements for deletion actions.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **27/10/2025, 20:16:17**: `api.ts` outlines initial set of API utilities, including product/collection search and `validateGstData`.
*   **27/10/2025, 20:16:40**: `apiEndpoints.ts` adds new endpoints for product variants, collections, and a `diyDiscounts` section.
*   **27/10/2025, 23:17:26**: `checkoutElementPage.tsx` shows comprehensive UI customization options, including logo upload logic.
*   **28/10/2025, 17:55:43**: `apiEndpoints.ts` introduces `setGstData` endpoint.
*   **28/10/2025, 18:12:15**: `api.ts` significantly revises `validateGstData` to include a two-step validation and setting process.
*   **28/10/2025, 19:36:58**: `api.ts` simplifies `validateGstData` to directly call `setGstData`, making its name potentially misleading.
*   **28/10/2025, 20:35:58**: `editAbcCart.tsx` expands its state to manage `gstDetails`.
*   **28/10/2025, 20:56:59**: `editAbcCart.tsx` updates an image import from `bookinfo.svg` to `gstBook.svg`, further emphasizing GST-related UI.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **API Interaction Consistency:** All significant data operations consistently use `makeAPICall` and construct URLs with `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and specific endpoints from `APIEndPoints`.
*   **GST Feature Development:** There's a clear pattern of introducing and refining GST-related functionality across multiple files. `api.ts` evolved its `validateGstData` function, `apiEndpoints.ts` gained a `setGstData` endpoint, and `editAbcCart.tsx` was updated to manage `gstDetails` in its state and incorporate a `gstBook.svg` image.
*   **Minor Re-saves/Formatting:** Several log entries for `checkoutElementPage.tsx` and `editAbcCart.tsx` show identical code content across consecutive timestamps (e.g., `editAbcCart.tsx` between 17:58:38 and 18:07:26, and numerous times later), suggesting frequent re-saves, automated formatting, or very minor, unlogged changes.
*   **UI Kit Usage:** Extensive use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components (Button, Card, Form, Input, etc.) and PixelIcons (`Sparkle`, `Link`, `Map`, `BreifCase`, `gstBook`) is evident across the UI components.

## 14:10:35
The provided log details changes across three files, primarily focusing on environment configuration and analytics integration within a checkout UI project. The timestamps indicate activity on October 27th and 28th, 2025, with a minor update on the 29th.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**

*   **Initial State (27/10/2025, 23:32:07):** This file defines various base URLs for different GoKwik services (health, address suggestion, core API, Cred, experiments, TwidPay, KP, CDN, analytics) based on the current `env` (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.). It also includes functions to retrieve environment-specific session and pass tokens. A `setCart` function is present, initializing a `store_cartjsObject` with a hardcoded cart containing one product and a specific cart token/key.
*   **Minor Adjustments (27/10/2025, 23:32:18 and 28/10/2025, 13:28:57):** There were brief, oscillating changes to the `api_url` for the 'local' environment, switching between `https://api.gokwik.co` and `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`. This indicates testing or refinement of the local development API endpoint.
*   **Significant Cart Data Update (28/10/2025, 13:29:25):** The `setCart` function was substantially updated. The hardcoded cart object was replaced with a new one featuring a different cart token/key, new attributes (including `LUID`, `SESSION_ID`, `WE_DATA`, `Gokwik`), an increased `item_count` to 2, and updated `total_price` and `original_total_price` values. The product details also changed from "5 Pocket Jean final very good jeans" to "5 Pocket Jean Very Good Jeans Is This".
*   **Further Cart Data and API URL Updates (29/10/2025, 11:01:39 and 29/10/2025, 11:01:51):** The `setCart` function was updated again with a new cart object. This latest cart reflects a discount (e.g., "BUY 2 & GET ₹200 OFF"), showing `total_discount` and adjusted `total_price`. The API URL for the 'local' environment in `api_url` was also reverted back to `https://api.gokwik.co`.
*   **Repeated API URL Flipping (29/10/2025, 12:14:15 and 29/10/2025, 12:14:26):** The `api_url` for the 'local' environment continued to alternate between `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` and `https://api.gokwik.co`, suggesting ongoing local testing configurations.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**

*   **Major Analytics Integration (28/10/2025, 14:40:38):** This file underwent a significant expansion to handle various foreign analytics platforms. It now imports a large number of stores for data points and includes functions to post events to different services (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Wigzo, FB, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds). Numerous variables were introduced to capture analytics data such as cart details, user information, marketing data (UTM parameters, landing page, referrer), and specific pixel IDs/configurations. It defines structures for price breakdowns, custom Facebook pixel events, and logic for dynamically configuring analytics based on `foreignAnalytics` store and `kwikOptimizerPixelIds`.
*   **Minor Debugging and Cleanup (28/10/2025, 15:13:09 to 28/10/2025, 16:12:33):** Several small changes were made, primarily involving the addition and subsequent removal or commenting out of `console.log` statements for debugging `store_localStorageObject` and `store_page` (renamed to `pageNumber`), and `store_isSkipOtp`. This indicates active debugging during this period.
*   **Further Store Integration and Merge Resolution (29/10/2025, 12:47:42 to 29/10/2025, 12:54:00):** This period shows the integration of `store_priceBreakUp` and `store_ppCodAmount` from `OrderStore`, along with the declaration of corresponding local variables (`isPpcod`, `isTotalPayableAmount`). A merge conflict artifact was present in one entry, which was resolved in the following entry, ensuring both new subscriptions (`store_ppCodAmount` and `store_page`) were correctly included.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**

*   **Comprehensive Initialization and Cookie Handling (28/10/2025, 14:44:14):** This Svelte component acts as the main entry point for the merchant's checkout UI. It was updated to include:
    *   Imports for various analytics services and helper functions.
    *   Initialization of numerous state variables for merchant ID, environment, cart, tokens, session IDs, tracking data (e.g., Shopify cookies, FBPixel, Snapchat click ID, Kwikpass tokens), and UI flags.
    *   `onMount` logic to dynamically inject CSS, dispatch a `gokwikLoaded` event, detect the environment, read and set various cookies (like `_shopify_s`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, UTM sources) for analytics and session tracking, and process URL query parameters (`mrid`, `gkref`, `ScCid`).
    *   It handles communication via `window.postMessage` for `merchantInfo` and `cartOpen` events, triggering `launchApp` and analytics logging.
    *   Includes logic to check for available UPI apps (GPay, PhonePe, CredPay, BHIM) on Android.
    *   The file uses an environment-specific `truecallerConfig` for Truecaller integration. It also defines how various cookie and URL parameters are parsed and stored.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**

*   **Local Development Setup (29/10/2025, 11:02:27):** This HTML file serves as a testing page for the GoKwik checkout. It includes an inline JavaScript SDK (`gokwikSdk`) responsible for injecting the main `gokwik.js` script and initiating the checkout flow. The `window.merchantInfo` object, crucial for testing, is hardcoded within this HTML script, specifying a merchant ID, `local` environment, store ID, and a Facebook Pixel ID. The page also features a form to manually input and save merchant ID and cart JSON data to cookies for testing purposes, alongside an environment selector. It includes basic cookie management functions (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) and event listeners for SDK communication.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**

*   **Extensive Discount Management (29/10/2025, 11:24:02 to 29/10/2025, 11:29:33):** This Svelte component is central to handling discounts.
    *   It imports a wide array of stores related to cart, offers, loyalty programs, and payment methods.
    *   It manages state for various discount types, including automatic discounts, stacked discounts, gift cards, loyalty rewards, and partner acquisition offers (e.g., CredPay, TwidPay, Gyftr).
    *   The `onMount` hook subscribes to multiple stores to reactively update discount configurations (e.g., `disable_discount_with_credits`, `disable_discount_with_giftcard`, `loyaltyApp`).
    *   It implements complex logic for `allowDiscountApplication` based on the number of clubbed discounts and the active state of stacked discounts.
    *   A significant part of the code focuses on filtering and displaying available offers, processing partner offers, and dynamically building an `allAppliedOffers` array to reflect active discounts.
    *   The various `onMount` and reactive (`$:`) blocks show continuous development in how different discount mechanisms are integrated and displayed within the checkout.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Multiple files (`EnvironmentService.ts`, `Merchant.svelte`, `public/merchant.html`) extensively use `env` variables or `window.merchantInfo.environment` to configure URLs, tokens, and other behaviors, indicating a robust multi-environment deployment strategy.
2.  **Debugging Logs:** The `ForeignAnalytics.ts` file shows a pattern of adding and removing `console.log` statements for debugging purposes over a short period, highlighting active development and testing.
3.  **Reactive Programming with Svelte Stores:** The use of `store_` prefixed variables and `.subscribe()` calls is prevalent in both Svelte components and service files, indicating a reactive state management pattern common in Svelte applications.
4.  **Extensive Analytics Integration:** There's a strong focus on tracking and integrating with various analytics platforms (CleverTap, FB, GA, Snapchat, etc.), suggesting a detailed approach to understanding user behavior and campaign performance within the checkout flow.
5.  **Hardcoded Test Data:** The `setCart` function in `EnvironmentService.ts` and the `window.merchantInfo` object in `public/merchant.html` contain hardcoded JSON objects for cart and merchant information, which are frequently updated, indicating an iterative process of testing specific checkout scenarios.
6.  **Complex Discount Logic:** The `Discounts.svelte` component demonstrates sophisticated handling of multiple discount types, their application rules, and visual representation, suggesting a feature-rich and flexible discount system.

**Omitted Information:**

As per instructions, details containing specific keys or sensitive identifiers (e.g., `truecallerConfig` keys, specific `XGokwikToken` values, `fbpixel` ID, actual cart `token` and `key` values) have been generalized or omitted from the summary.

## 15:09:20
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`, across three timestamps on `28/10/2025` at `12:27:10`, `12:27:41`, and `12:29:42`.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**: The content of this Dockerfile is identical across all three timestamps. It outlines the build process for a Node.js application within a Docker container.
    *   It starts with `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
    *   Sets the working directory to `/app`.
    *   Installs `openssl` for essential SSL support.
    *   Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` first, then installs dependencies using `npm install -f`.
    *   Copies the rest of the application source code.
    *   Includes steps to generate the Prisma schema (`npx prisma generate`) and build the application (`npm run build`).
    *   Exposes port `3000`.
    *   The `CMD` specifies `npm start` to run the application.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   While there are three distinct timestamps (`28/10/2025, 12:27:10`, `28/10/2025, 12:27:41`, `28/10/2025, 12:29:42`), the content of the `Dockerfile` remained unchanged across all entries. This indicates that no functional modifications were recorded between these saves, or it represents a stable configuration being logged multiple times.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   The primary pattern observed is the complete consistency of the `Dockerfile` content across all entries. This suggests a fixed and robust Docker build configuration for a Node.js application that incorporates Prisma for database interactions. The steps are clearly defined for setting up the environment, installing dependencies, building the application, and finally running it.

## 15:09:33
The provided log details recent development on a checkout dashboard UI, primarily focusing on API interactions, UI customization, and abandoned cart management, with a notable pattern of continuous refinement for GST-related features and frequent, minor commits.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:17:** Introduced new functions `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` for fetching product variant/collection details and `validateGstData` for GST validation.
    *   **28/10/2025, 18:08:31 - 28/10/2025, 19:37:08:** The `validateGstData` function was iteratively refined. Initially, it reported success via a UI message after validation. Later, it was refactored to perform a `validateGstData` API call, and if successful, a subsequent `setGstData` API call. Ultimately, the separate `validateGstData` API call was removed, and the function directly calls `setGstData`, handling errors by returning `false` or `null`. The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was removed during these changes (28/10/2025, 18:12:15).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 20:16:40:** Added new API endpoints: `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById`, which were intended for use in the `api.ts` file.
    *   **28/10/2025, 17:55:43:** A new API endpoint, `setGstData` (`/api/dashboard/agent-order/gst/set`), was introduced to support the updated GST logic in `api.ts`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx`**
    *   **27/10/2025, 23:17:26:** This file, related to UI customization, includes features like "One Click Checkout", "Discount Application", "Exit Popout" configurations, and logic for managing a line item logo upload. It showed two identical commits within minutes, suggesting a brief save interval.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **28/10/2025, 19:44:01:** Added `merchant_id` to component state, fetched from Redux.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:04:58:** Updated a UI icon from `bookinfo.svg` to `gstBook.svg`, indicating a visual change likely related to GST.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:21:29:** Imported new visual assets: `Map` and `BreifCase` icons.
    *   **28/10/2025, 20:35:58:** Added `gstDetails: null` to the component's state, preparing the UI for handling GST information.
    *   This file experienced numerous rapid, consecutive commits on 28/10/2025 (17:58:38 - 21:12:19), many of which displayed no discernible code changes in the provided snippets.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   **29/10/2025, 14:48:56:** This file is for configuring shipping methods, including defining rules based on shipping names, prices, and order values, as well as handling advanced conditions using customer segments and CSV uploads for pincode lists. It also contains functionality for adding, editing, and deleting shipping configurations.
    *   Similar to `editAbcCart.tsx`, this file also had multiple rapid, identical commits on 29/10/2025 (14:51:39 - 15:00:20).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **API-Centric Development:** The codebase relies heavily on `makeAPICall` for all data interactions, fetching and posting data to various backend endpoints.
*   **Modular API Structure:** API endpoints are centrally defined in `apiEndpoints.ts`, promoting maintainability.
*   **UI Component Library:** Extensive use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components (Buttons, Forms, Inputs, etc.) indicates a standardized and consistent UI.
*   **State Management:** React's `useState` and `useSelector` (from Redux) are frequently used for both local and global state management, respectively.
*   **GST Feature Development:** There's a clear development trend towards integrating and refining GST validation and submission capabilities across the utility and UI layers.
*   **Frequent Commits/Saves:** Many consecutive timestamps show no code changes, particularly for UI-focused files, suggesting a workflow with frequent auto-saves or very granular commits.

## 15:10:09
On 27/10/2025, between 23:32:07 and 23:32:18, there were updates to the `setCart` function within `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`. Specifically, the cart object set for `store_cartjsObject` was modified. Later, on 28/10/2025 at 13:28:57 and 13:29:25, further changes were made to the same file, altering the `setCart` function's JSON payload, including token and cart item details. This file contains environment-specific URLs and hardcoded session tokens and Truecaller API keys, and as such, detailed analysis of its specific content changes is not provided due to the policy on sensitive information. The same applies to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` (timestamp 28/10/2025, 14:44:14) which also embeds `truecallerConfig` keys and other identifiers, and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (timestamp 29/10/2025, 11:02:27) which directly configures `merchantInfo` with pixel IDs and handles cookies for tracking. These files are excluded from detailed content summary because they appear to store sensitive keys and configurations.

**File-Specific Updates (Non-Sensitive Files):**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**: This file saw numerous updates across 28/10/2025 (from 14:40:38 to 16:13:46) and 29/10/2025 (from 12:47:42 to 12:54:00).
    *   **Analytics Setup**: It maintains extensive integration with various analytics platforms (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, FB, GA, GA4, Snapchat, Google Ads, etc.) and manages variables for tracking cart details, user information, and pixel configurations.
    *   **Debugging and Refinement (28/10/2025)**: The code frequently included and later commented out `console.log` statements for debugging `localStorageObject` tokens (around 15:13:09 and 15:23:42). It introduced a new import and subscription for `store_isSkipOtp` and `store_page` from `LoginStore` to track user behavior related to OTP and current page context.
    *   **Data Integration & Merge Resolution (29/10/2025)**: Significant changes involved integrating `store_priceBreakUp` and `store_ppCodAmount` from `OrderStore`, declaring new variables `isPpcod` and `isTotalPayableAmount`, and adding their respective subscriptions. There was an apparent merge conflict (indicated by `<<<<<<< HEAD` markers) around 12:47:42, which was swiftly resolved in subsequent commits by 12:54:00, correctly incorporating the new store subscriptions and removing temporary debug logs. These changes aim to enhance the granularity of analytics data related to pricing and payment methods.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts`**: This file, updated on 28/10/2025 at 15:44:07, details the event mapping and payload construction for CleverTap analytics.
    *   It defines a clear mapping (`mappedKey`) to standardize data fields for CleverTap events and functions to create event bodies (`createBody`).
    *   A dispatcher function `callCleverTap` handles various checkout-related events, such as `phoneNumber`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentCompleted`, and `userAddress`.
    *   Specific helper functions (`cleverTapPhoneNumber`, `cleverTapPaymentCompleted`, etc.) prepare event-specific data, including handling product details, pricing, and marketing source information.
    *   It includes logic for merchant-specific customizations, such as adding/removing `item_id` multi-values for 'levi' merchants on the 'Charged' event.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**: This file saw multiple entries on 29/10/2025 between 11:24:02 and 11:29:33. However, all these logs indicate identical code content, suggesting no functional changes were recorded within this time window.
    *   **Discount Management**: The component is responsible for displaying and applying various discounts, offers, and wallet credits.
    *   **Complex Logic**: It imports numerous state management stores (cart, discount codes, user address, payment methods, pricing) and integrates services for handling wallet credits, gift cards, and partner-specific offers (e.g., CredPay, TwidPay, Gyftr).
    *   **Reactive Updates**: It defines many reactive Svelte variables to manage UI state, such as `discountCouponApplied`, `stackedDiscountConfig`, `allowDiscountApplication`, and `allAppliedOffers`, which dynamically constructs a list of applied discounts based on various criteria and configurations.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Continuous Analytics Development**: There's a clear pattern of ongoing development and refinement in analytics tracking, particularly evident in `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, with frequent debugging, new data point integrations, and resolution of merge conflicts related to analytics data flow.
*   **Environment Configuration Adjustments**: The `EnvironmentService.ts` file is a recurring point of change for updating API endpoints and local development cart data, indicating active environment management.
*   **Modular Store Usage**: Across `ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `Discounts.svelte`, there's heavy reliance on a modular store pattern (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_phoneNo`, `store_requestIdObject`) to manage application state and share data between components and services.
*   **Debugging Practices**: The presence and removal of `console.log` statements for various data points across different files suggest an iterative development and debugging workflow.
*   **Detailed Event Tracking**: The `CleverTap.ts` file exemplifies a structured approach to mapping internal application events to external analytics platform events, ensuring consistent data collection.

## 16:09:21
The log primarily details changes, or rather the consistent state, of a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

All three entries, recorded within a short timeframe on 28/10/2025 (specifically between 12:27:10 and 12:29:42), show the exact same content for this Dockerfile. This indicates that no actual code changes were made to the Dockerfile within these timestamps; instead, the identical configuration was logged repeatedly.

The Dockerfile itself outlines a standard build and run process for a Node.js application:
*   It uses `node:20-alpine` as its base image.
*   Sets the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installs `openssl`.
*   Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` for dependency installation (`npm install -f`).
*   Copies the rest of the application code.
*   Includes a step to generate the Prisma schema (`npx prisma generate`).
*   Builds the application (`npm run build`).
*   Exposes port `3000`.
*   Starts the application using `npm start`.

The recurring pattern is the complete immutability of the Dockerfile's content across all logged timestamps, suggesting a snapshot of a stable configuration or repeated logging of the same file state.

## 16:10:22
The provided log details code changes across several files related to a checkout UI, primarily focusing on environment configurations, analytics integration, and discount management.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 27/10/2025, 23:32:07; 27/10/2025, 23:32:18; 28/10/2025, 13:28:57; 28/10/2025, 13:29:25; 29/10/2025, 11:01:39; 29/10/2025, 11:01:51; 29/10/2025, 12:14:15; 29/10/2025, 12:14:26
    *   This file is central to defining environment-specific API endpoints and other configurations.
    *   Throughout the log, the `api_url` function's URL for the `'local'` environment was frequently toggled between `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` and `https://api.gokwik.co`.
    *   A notable change occurred on **29/10/2025, 11:01:39**, where the `setCart` function's hardcoded cart object was significantly updated. This included changes to attributes like `platform_source`, `gb_values`, `client_id`, `ga_session_id`, `Gokwik`, as well as modifications to `original_total_price`, `total_price`, `total_discount`, and the specific `items` details (product ID, title, prices, SKU, vendor, image URL, and discount information). This change likely simulates a different cart state for local development or testing.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 28/10/2025, 14:40:38; 28/10/2025, 14:41:10; 28/10/2025, 14:41:56; 28/10/2025, 14:43:25; 28/10/2025, 15:13:09; 28/10/2025, 15:22:05; 28/10/2025, 15:23:42; 28/10/2025, 15:51:04; 28/10/2025, 15:51:29; 28/10/2025, 15:54:40; 28/10/2025, 15:54:59; 28/10/2025, 16:09:27; 28/10/2025, 16:12:33; 29/10/2025, 12:47:42; 29/10/2025, 12:48:14; 29/10/2025, 12:54:00
    *   This file is responsible for integrating various foreign analytics platforms (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Facebook, GA, GA4, Snapchat, etc.). It collects and processes user, cart, and order-related data for these platforms.
    *   Several changes involved adding and removing `console.log` debugging statements, indicating active debugging during **28/10/2025, 15:13:09** through **16:12:33**. For example, a `console.log` for a "Token" was added and later removed, and a `console.log` for "Skip OTP" was added and removed.
    *   On **29/10/2025, 12:47:42**, a merge conflict was introduced, which was then resolved on **29/10/2025, 12:48:14**. The resolution integrated new subscriptions for `store_priceBreakUp` and `store_ppCodAmount` from `OrderStore`, indicating an expansion of the data collected for analytics to include price breakdown and prepaid COD amounts.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 28/10/2025, 14:44:14
    *   This Svelte component serves as the main entry point for the merchant's checkout UI.
    *   It imports various analytics services and helper functions.
    *   The `onMount` lifecycle hook includes logic to initialize keyframes, dispatch a 'gokwikLoaded' event, check the environment, add prefetch tags, and detect iOS Safari.
    *   It handles URL query parameters (`mrid`, `gkref`, `ScCid`, `so_token`, `gk_token`, `isSameWindowRedirection`, `isSuccess`, `gokwikOid`) for features like abandoned cart tracking and redirection.
    *   It sets numerous cookies related to Shopify session, UTM source, FBPixel, and other tracking data.
    *   Event listeners are set up for messages from the modal window, including `merchantInfo` and `cartOpen`.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 28/10/2025, 15:44:07
    *   This file defines how events are sent to CleverTap analytics.
    *   It includes comprehensive data mapping (`mappedKey`) for transforming internal data keys to CleverTap's expected format.
    *   Functions like `cleverTapPhoneNumber`, `cleverTapMobileGK`, `cleverTapPincode`, `clevertapPaymentMethod`, `cleverTapPaymentCompleted`, `cleverTapUserAddress`, `cleverTapUserAddressDetailed`, `clevertapCheckoutStarted`, and `cleverTapDiscountEvent` are defined to push specific events with relevant data to CleverTap.
    *   It also contains logic for constructing abandoned cart (ABC) URLs with tracking parameters for SMS, email, and WhatsApp.

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 29/10/2025, 11:02:27
    *   This HTML file serves as a test page for the GoKwik SDK.
    *   It contains an embedded `gokwikSdk` JavaScript object for initializing the checkout, managing events, and a UI to input a Merchant ID and JSON cart data for testing.
    *   The script includes functionality to set `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` cookies.
    *   A hardcoded `window.merchantInfo` object is present, used to initialize the SDK with a `mid`, `environment`, `storeId`, and `fbpixel` (Facebook Pixel ID).

6.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 29/10/2025, 11:24:02; 29/10/2025, 11:25:19; 29/10/2025, 11:25:27; 29/10/2025, 11:29:27; 29/10/2025, 11:29:33
    *   This Svelte component handles the display and application logic for various discounts and offers within the checkout process.
    *   It subscribes to numerous common, login, and order-related stores to manage its state.
    *   The component tracks and displays different types of discounts, including automatic, stacked, one-click, gift cards, and partner acquisition offers.
    *   It defines a computed property `allAppliedOffers` to aggregate and format all currently applied discounts for UI presentation, handling their removability and source.
    *   It also manages flags for disabling discounts with credits/gift cards and for COD with loyalty.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file consistently demonstrates a pattern of defining URLs and tokens that vary based on the deployment environment (e.g., `local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`). This indicates a robust multi-environment setup.
*   **State Management with Svelte Stores:** There's extensive use of `store_` prefixed variables (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_environment`, `store_discountCode`, `store_merchantInfo`) across different files (`ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Discounts.svelte`, `EnvironmentService.ts`). This highlights a centralized state management pattern, likely using Svelte's reactive stores, to share data and react to changes across components and services.
*   **Analytics Integration:** Multiple files show a strong emphasis on analytics. `ForeignAnalytics.ts` acts as an orchestrator, gathering data from various stores and dispatching it to specific analytics services, as exemplified by `CleverTap.ts`. This indicates a comprehensive approach to tracking user behavior and order events for different marketing and data analysis platforms.
*   **Debugging Activities:** The presence and subsequent removal of `console.log` statements in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` during various timestamps suggest ongoing debugging and development cycles.
*   **Hardcoded Test Data:** `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` both show instances of hardcoded data (e.g., the `setCart` object and `window.merchantInfo`), indicating a development/testing environment where specific scenarios can be easily simulated.
*   **Frequent Saves:** Many timestamps show very short intervals between changes, often with no functional difference in the code, which is characteristic of frequent saving during active development.
*   **Cookie Management:** `Merchant.svelte` and `merchant.html` demonstrate managing browser cookies for tracking and session information (`_shopify_s`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, `gk_utm_source`, etc.), which is crucial for web analytics and user experience.

In summary, the changes reflect active development focused on refining environment configurations, enhancing analytics tracking across multiple platforms, and developing sophisticated discount and offer management within the checkout flow. Debugging and testing are also evident through the use of console logs and hardcoded test data.

## 17:09:20
The provided log entries exclusively track changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-specific updates:**
The `Dockerfile` content is identical across all three log entries. It specifies a build process for a Node.js application:
*   Uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Sets the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installs `openssl` for SSL support.
*   Copies `package*.json` and installs dependencies using `npm install -f`.
*   Copies the entire application source code.
*   Generates the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Builds the application via `npm run build`.
*   Exposes port `3000`.
*   Defines `npm start` as the command to run the application.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The timestamps recorded are `28/10/2025, 12:27:10`, `28/10/2025, 12:27:41`, and `28/10/2025, 12:29:42`. While there are three distinct timestamps, the absence of any code differences between these entries means there were no *code-significant* changes in the `Dockerfile` during this period. The entries merely record the state of the file at different moments.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**
The most prominent pattern is the **complete immutability of the `Dockerfile` content**. Despite being logged three times within a span of approximately two and a half minutes, the code within the file remained precisely the same. This indicates that the exact same `Dockerfile` configuration was present and recorded at each of these timestamps without any modifications.

## 17:10:14
The changes log shows active development and refinement across several core files within a checkout UI project (`gokwik.pdp`), spanning two days (27th to 29th of October, 2025).

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp (27/10/2025, 23:32:07 - 28/10/2025, 13:29:25)**: Frequent minor adjustments were made to the `api_url` function, specifically for the `local` environment. The base URL for the `local` environment was toggled multiple times between `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` and `https://api.gokwik.co`, indicating active local development and testing against different backend endpoints.
    *   **Timestamp (29/10/2025, 11:01:39)**: The `setCart` function, primarily used for mocking cart data in the `local` environment, received a substantial update. The mock cart content changed from a single item with a `total_price` of `10000` and no discounts to a two-item cart with `original_total_price:179800`, `total_price:159800`, and `total_discount:20000` due to a "BUY 2 & GET ₹200 OFF" offer. Additionally, new cart `attributes` like `platform_source`, `gb_values`, `client_id`, and `ga_session_id` were introduced.
    *   **Timestamp (29/10/2025, 11:01:51)**: The `api_url` for the `local` environment was again switched back to `https://api.gokwik.co`.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp (28/10/2025, 15:13:09 - 16:12:33)**: This file saw a series of rapid, minor changes, primarily involving adding and removing `console.log` statements for debugging purposes. These logs targeted `localStorageObject`, `store_isSkipOtp`, and `store_page` to monitor their respective values during execution. Imports for `store_isSkipOtp` and `store_page` were also added and subsequently removed or re-added in this period.
    *   **Timestamp (29/10/2025, 12:47:42)**: A merge conflict was encountered and resolved. This resolution introduced new data points for analytics: `store_priceBreakUp` and `store_ppCodAmount` were imported and subscribed to. This indicates an expansion of tracking capabilities to include detailed pricing breakdowns and specific COD (Cash on Delivery) amounts.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp (28/10/2025, 14:44:14)**: This entry provides a snapshot of the component's state. It functions as the main UI component, integrating various analytics services (e.g., CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, Facebook, GA) and managing environment-specific configurations like `truecallerConfig` (which holds names and keys for different environments). It handles incoming messages from iframes (`merchantInfo`, `cartOpen`) and processes URL parameters and cookies for tracking.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp (29/10/2025, 11:02:27)**: This HTML file serves as a local testing environment. It contains a custom `gokwikSdk` to interact with the checkout, and a form to manually input merchant details and mock cart data. The `window.merchantInfo` object is hardcoded for local testing, frequently switching between different `mid` values by commenting and uncommenting, reflecting a common practice for testing various merchant integrations.

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp (29/10/2025, 11:24:02 - 11:29:33)**: No significant functional changes were observed in the provided snippets for this component. It is a complex component responsible for discount and offer management, subscribing to numerous stores (`CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`) to manage UI states related to applied and available discounts, gift cards, and loyalty programs. It features reactive statements to aggregate and display applied offers, supporting automatic, stacked, and partner-specific discounts.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Environment Configuration**: A consistent pattern across the project is the use of an `env` variable to determine API endpoints and specific configurations, particularly evident in `EnvironmentService.ts`.
*   **Debugging**: Frequent addition and removal of `console.log` statements in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` suggest ongoing active debugging efforts.
*   **State Management**: The widespread use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_requestIdObject`) for state management and inter-component communication is a recurring theme, allowing different parts of the application to react to data changes.
*   **Analytics Integration**: There's a strong emphasis on integrating various third-party analytics services, collecting detailed user and order data for tracking, as seen in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `Merchant.svelte`.
*   **Local Development Setup**: The `merchant.html` file demonstrates a structured approach to local development and testing, allowing developers to simulate different merchant scenarios easily.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: The timestamps show numerous changes within a short period for key files, indicating rapid development cycles, testing, and integration.
*   **Mock Data Management**: The `setCart` function in `EnvironmentService.ts` is central to populating mock cart data for local testing, and its updates reflect evolving testing requirements (e.g., testing with discounts, multiple items, new attributes).

## 18:09:19
The log primarily details activity related to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-specific updates:**
The `Dockerfile` defines the build process for a Node.js application. It consistently uses `node:20-alpine` as its base image, sets the working directory to `/app`, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` for dependency installation (`npm install -f`), copies the remaining application code, generates the Prisma schema (`npx prisma generate`), builds the application (`npm run build`), exposes port `3000`, and starts the application with `npm start`.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The timestamps recorded are 28/10/2025 at 12:27:10, 12:27:41, and 12:29:42. These timestamps indicate three distinct log entries for the `Dockerfile` within a short three-minute window.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**
A significant pattern is that the content of the `Dockerfile` remains absolutely identical across all three logged entries. This suggests that no actual code changes were introduced into the file between these timestamps. The entries likely represent multiple saves, version control commits, or system logs of the same file state, rather than functional modifications to the Dockerfile itself. The content consistently outlines standard steps for containerizing a Node.js application that uses Prisma.

## 18:10:08
The changes span multiple files focused on the GoKwik checkout UI, primarily dealing with analytics, discounts, and core merchant-side logic. A recurring pattern involves the use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_merchantInfo`) for managing global state and reactive data flow across the application. Many changes also include temporary `console.log` statements for debugging, which are subsequently removed or refined.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (28/10, 14:40:38)**: This file was significantly updated to handle foreign analytics integrations. It declares numerous variables for capturing various aspects of the user's journey, cart contents, marketing data (e.g., UTM parameters, Facebook pixel IDs), and transaction details. It sets up subscriptions to several stores (`LoginStore`, `OrderStore`, `CommonStore`) to update these variables reactively. Key data structures like `priceBreakup` and `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` are defined.
    *   **Debugging and Refinements (28/10, 15:13:09 - 16:13:46)**: Over several commits, debugging `console.log` statements were added for `store_localStorageObject` and `store_isSkipOtp`, and later removed or adjusted. The `store_page` was introduced and its value (`pageNumber`) was briefly logged, indicating an intent to track checkout page progression. Imports for `store_isSkipOtp` were added and removed in conjunction with these debug efforts.
    *   **Enhanced Financial Tracking (29/10, 12:47:42 - 12:54:00)**: This update integrated more detailed financial tracking by importing `store_priceBreakUp` and `store_ppCodAmount` from `OrderStore`. New variables `isPpcod` and `isTotalPayableAmount` were added to capture these specific price components. A merge conflict, evident at 12:47:42, was resolved by 12:48:14, correctly integrating these new subscriptions and variable assignments.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` (28/10, 14:44:14)**: This core Svelte component, likely the entry point for the merchant-facing UI, was updated to include:
    *   Imports for a wide array of analytics services (e.g., CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, Facebook, GA4, Snapchat) and helper functions for UI and cookie management.
    *   Logic for processing URL query parameters (`mrid`, `gkref`, `ScCid`, `gokwikOid`, `kwik`) to handle abandoned cart flows and other specific checkout redirections.
    *   Cookie management functions (`setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad`, `getKpParamForFb`, `getGaCookies`) to capture and set various session and tracking identifiers (Shopify session ID, FBP, FBC, UTM sources, discount codes).
    *   Functionality for detecting the environment (e.g., Glance), checking available UPI apps, and configuring cash-to-prepaid flows.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts` (28/10, 15:44:07)**: This file saw a comprehensive update to manage CleverTap-specific analytics events. It defines:
    *   Data mapping mechanisms (`keysToConvert`, `mappedKey`) to transform generic event data into CleverTap's required format.
    *   Functions (`createBody`, `replacedItems`, `pushCleverTap`) to construct and dispatch various events like 'phoneNumber', 'PIN_Code_Added_GK', 'Payment_Method_Selected_GK', 'GK_Charged', and events related to user addresses and coupon application status.
    *   It includes logic to pass detailed event properties such as products, currency, promo codes, total amounts, address details, and marketing data.
    *   Specific event handling logic is noted for certain merchant origins (e.g., 'levi').

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` (29/10, 11:24:02 - 11:29:33)**: This component, responsible for handling discounts and offers in the checkout, received several updates:
    *   It imports an extensive list of common, login, and order-related stores to manage all aspects of discount application, display, and interaction.
    *   It uses reactive Svelte statements (`$:`) to dynamically update `loyaltyDisplayName` and `allAppliedOffers` based on store values. `allAppliedOffers` aggregates automatic, stacked, and partner-specific discounts (like Cred).
    *   On component mount, it subscribes to `store_requestIdObject` to fetch custom configurations for discounts (e.g., disabling discounts based on credits or gift cards, loyalty app details, dynamic automatic discount rules).
    *   It also subscribes to `store_reapplyEr` for re-applying store credits and `store_stackedDiscounts` to manage complex discount stacking logic, including controlling when further discounts can be applied (`allowDiscountApplication`).
    *   The `store_offers` subscription processes and filters available offers for display in the UI.

## 20:22:53
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`, across three timestamps on October 28, 2025 (12:27:10, 12:27:41, and 12:29:42).

**File-specific updates:**
The content of the `Dockerfile` remained identical across all three recorded timestamps. There were no modifications to the file's code within this log sequence.

**Content overview:**
The `Dockerfile` defines the build process for a Node.js application:
*   It uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Sets the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installs `openssl` using `apk`.
*   Copies `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files initially for efficient caching.
*   Installs project dependencies with `npm install -f`.
*   Copies the remaining application source code.
*   Generates the Prisma schema using `npx prisma generate`.
*   Builds the application via `npm run build`.
*   Exposes port `3000`.
*   Starts the application with `npm start`.

**Patterns/Recurring elements:**
The key pattern observed is the complete stability of the `Dockerfile` content despite being logged at three distinct times. This suggests either multiple saves without changes or an external system recording the file's state at intervals where no functional code alterations occurred. The `Dockerfile` itself follows a common pattern for containerizing Node.js applications that utilize Prisma.

## 21:22:51
The provided log details three updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-specific updates:**
The Dockerfile is configured to containerize a Node.js application. Key steps include:
*   **Base Image:** Uses `node:20-alpine` as the base.
*   **Working Directory:** Sets `/app` as the working directory.
*   **System Dependencies:** Installs `openssl` using `apk`.
*   **Dependency Management:** Copies `package*.json` files first, then runs `npm install -f` to install Node.js dependencies.
*   **Application Code:** Copies the entire application source code into the container.
*   **Database Schema:** Generates the Prisma schema using `npx prisma generate`.
*   **Build Process:** Executes `npm run build` to build the application.
*   **Port Exposure:** Exposes port `3000`.
*   **Startup Command:** Starts the application using `npm start`.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**
The log shows three distinct timestamps for the `Dockerfile`:
*   28/10/2025, 12:27:10
*   28/10/2025, 12:27:41
*   28/10/2025, 12:29:42

Despite these multiple entries, the *content* of the Dockerfile remains entirely identical across all three timestamps. This indicates a series of saves or commits that occurred within a short span (approximately 2 minutes and 32 seconds) without any functional changes to the Dockerfile's code during this period.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**
The most prominent pattern is the complete and exact repetition of the Dockerfile's content across all logged entries. This specific Dockerfile itself follows a standard pattern for building Node.js applications with Prisma in a Docker container, including steps for installing dependencies, generating schemas, building the application, and defining the runtime command.

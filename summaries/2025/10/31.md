# Activity Summary for 31/10/2025

## 07:58:39
The provided log primarily details changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   **Initial Versions (28/10/2025):** The Dockerfile was consistent across three entries on 28/10/2025 (at 12:27:10, 12:27:41, and 12:29:42). These versions establish a standard Node.js application build process:
        *   Uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
        *   Sets `/app` as the working directory.
        *   Installs `openssl` via `apk add`.
        *   Copies `package*.json` files for dependency installation.
        *   Installs dependencies using `npm install -f`.
        *   Copies the remaining application source code.
        *   Generates Prisma schema using `npx prisma generate`.
        *   Builds the application with `npm run build`.
        *   Exposes port `3000`.
        *   Starts the application with `npm start`.
    *   **Later Version (29/10/2025, 23:35:21):** A minor but notable change was introduced. The dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`, removing the force flag. All other steps in the Dockerfile remained identical to the earlier versions.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **28/10/2025, 12:27:10**: Marks the initial recording of the Dockerfile's structure.
*   **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**: Indicates the first functional change to the Dockerfile, specifically modifying the `npm install` command.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Dockerfile Structure:** The overall structure and sequence of commands within the Dockerfile remained largely unchanged, indicating a stable deployment process for the `mint-dashboard` application. This includes consistent use of `node:20-alpine`, `WORKDIR /app`, steps for dependency management, Prisma generation, building, and application startup.
*   **Minor Iterative Refinements:** The only discernible pattern in the changes is a minor refinement to the `npm install` command, suggesting an adjustment in how dependencies are managed during the Docker build process. The removal of the `-f` flag might imply a change in dependency resolution strategy or a fix for potential issues caused by forcing installation.

## 07:58:53
The provided log shows changes across three main files: `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `shippingBasedData.tsx`, `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `loginPage.tsx`, `mobilePage.tsx`, `index.ts` (customize-ui store), `formRender.tsx`, and `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, along with configuration changes in `.env` and `index.ejs`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes occurred between 29/10/2025, 15:24:36 and 30/10/2025, 11:00:27.
    *   **Summary:** This file, `ShippingMethodConfig`, is responsible for configuring shipping methods based on price ranges. The content remains largely consistent across all timestamps, suggesting minor, iterative changes or reformatting without significant functional alterations visible in the provided snippets. It includes functionality for fetching customer segments, uploading/downloading CSV files (likely for pincodes or cohorts), and defining shipping price rules with minimum/maximum order values. It also handles form submission and validation for shipping name uniqueness and number input restrictions. The `Inputs` object for file uploads is for CSV files containing pincodes.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes occurred between 29/10/2025, 16:43:05 and 30/10/2025, 10:34:46.
    *   **Summary:** This file defines the `processProductBasedShippingData` function, which structures data and fields for product-based shipping rules.
        *   **29/10/2025, 17:22:56:** Introduction of `previousShippingId` as a local `let` variable within the `processProductBasedShippingData` function. This variable is intended to track the previously selected shipping ID, likely for editing purposes.
        *   **29/10/2025, 17:29:02:** The `previousShippingId` variable is changed from a local `let` to a `useState` hook: `const [previousShippingId, setPreviousShippingId] = useState(null)`. This makes `previousShippingId` part of the component's state, allowing it to persist across re-renders and be updated.
        *   **Overall:** The file processes shipping data, transforms it into a table format (`tableData`), maps products/collections for UI display (`dataMapperForItems`), and generates `selectedOptions` for mapping product-based rules to existing shipping IDs. It includes form fields for rule name, price, calculation method, price multiplier, and weight combination, along with `ProductSearch` components for adding products/collections.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between 29/10/2025, 16:45:25 and 30/10/2025, 11:01:12.
    *   **Summary:** This component `ProductBasedShipping` manages the UI for creating and editing product-based shipping rules.
        *   **29/10/2025, 16:45:25:** `handleFormSubmit` is largely commented out (saveConfig, setItemsData, setModalOpen, form.resetFields), implying development or debugging where the actual save logic was temporarily disabled.
        *   **29/10/2025, 16:46:10:** The commented-out code in `handleFormSubmit` is uncommented, re-enabling the saving of configuration, resetting item data, closing the modal, and resetting form fields.
        *   **29/10/2025, 16:47:58 to 29/10/2025, 17:27:06:** The save logic in `handleFormSubmit` is again commented out for several revisions, indicating a period of development where the persistence mechanism was being tested or refactored.
        *   **29/10/2025, 17:23:01:** The `processProductBasedShippingData` function is updated to return `previousShippingId`, which is then captured by this component: `const { ..., previousShippingId } = processProductBasedShippingData(...)`.
        *   **29/10/2025, 17:25:08:** Logic is added to `handleFormSubmit` to handle the removal of `product_based_rules` from a `targetedShipping` item if the modal is open and a `previousShippingId` exists. This is crucial for correctly handling updates where a shipping rule might be moved or replaced.
        *   **29/10/2025, 17:30:43:** The commented-out `saveConfig` and related `form.resetFields()` calls in `handleFormSubmit` are uncommented, re-enabling the full submission flow.
        *   **30/10/2025, 10:35:02:** A `console.log(shippingPrices)` is added within the `useEffect` hook that updates `shippingPrices`, likely for debugging purposes related to how shipping configurations are loaded and updated.
        *   **30/10/2025, 10:36:15:** The `console.log` in the `useEffect` is changed to `console.log(config?.shipping_prices)`, making it more specific to the incoming configuration data rather than the state variable.
        *   **Overall:** This component handles product-based shipping rules, including their creation, editing, validation (requiring at least one product/collection), and persistence. It utilizes a drawer for editing, dynamically displays products/collections in a table, and interacts with a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook for configuration management.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Changes occurred between 29/10/2025, 18:04:43 and 29/10/2025, 18:27:17.
    *   **Summary:** This Redux slice manages UI customization data.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:05:03:** A new property `is_consent_auto_select: true` is added to the `login_data` object in the `initialState`. This likely indicates the introduction of a feature to automatically select a consent checkbox on the login page.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:27:17:** The `is_consent_required` property in `login_data` is renamed to `isConsentVisible`. This is a significant refactoring of the naming convention for the consent feature.
        *   **Overall:** The slice defines initial UI customization states for brand, login, address, and payment pages and provides reducers to update these states.

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between 29/10/2025, 18:09:05 and 29/10/2025, 18:58:39.
    *   **Summary:** This component `Login` provides UI customization options for the login page of the checkout process.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:17:05:** The "Primary Button" CTA text input is integrated into the `fields` array as a `switch` type, moving it from a separate `<Card>` component.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:18:16:** All individual `<Card>` components that previously wrapped single `RenderField` elements are consolidated. Instead, the `fields` array is mapped, and each `RenderField` is wrapped by a `<Card>`. This suggests a refactoring to apply card styling consistently to each form field definition.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:19:02 to 29/10/2025, 18:21:47:** Minor styling adjustments within the `label` prop for the "Primary Button" field, particularly affecting text classes (e.g., `font-normal`, `text-gray-500`).
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:23:18:** The "Primary Button" field is converted from a `switch` type back to a `custom` render type within the `fields` array. This re-embeds the switch, text, and input directly within the `render` function. The original separate "Primary Button" Card is removed, with its content now part of the `fields` array rendering.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:26:23:** The "Consent Section" is moved into the `fields` array as a `custom` render type, similar to how the "Primary Button" was handled. The previously separate "Consent Section" `<Card>` is removed.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:27:00:** The `is_consent_required` state variable and corresponding form field are renamed to `isConsentVisible` to align with the Redux store change. The initial state `initialValues.login_data.is_consent_required` is also renamed to `isConsentVisible`.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:39:37:** The `RenderEditorFunction` for the Consent Section is replaced with a direct rendering of switches and text, utilizing a new `BannerComponentRendrer` for the actual text input if consent is visible. This streamlines the rendering logic within the `fields` array.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:40:13:** A specific paragraph for "Control the text to display to the users on the consent section box on login step" is added directly under the Consent Section switch, providing more explicit UI guidance.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:44:05:** A new switch for `is_consent_auto_select` is added to the Consent Section. This allows merchants to configure whether the offers and updates consent box is pre-selected.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:45:22:** Minor styling change: `mt-2` is added to the "Consent Section Text" span, providing some top margin.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:46:01:** The `is_consent_auto_select` property is added to the `initialValues.login_data` object, ensuring its default state is true upon component initialization.
        *   **29/10/2025, 18:58:39:** A new validation check is added to `handleFormSubmit` to ensure `primary_button_text` is not empty if `isContinueButtonVisible` is true. This prevents saving configurations with an enabled but empty CTA button.
        *   **Overall:** The `Login` page is continually refined, moving towards a more structured form field definition using the `fields` array and `RenderField` component. Key functionality includes managing banner display, CTA button text, and a consent section, with the addition of auto-select for consent and stricter validation for button text.

6.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between 29/10/2025, 18:48:04 and 29/10/2025, 19:03:58.
    *   **Summary:** This component `MobileStepUI` renders a mobile preview of the checkout UI based on customization settings.
        *   **Content remains consistent across the provided diffs for this file.** No discernible functional or structural changes are apparent in the log snippets provided. This indicates either minor formatting/whitespace changes or changes outside the scope of the provided lines for this file.
        *   **Overall:** The component dynamically renders different parts of a mobile checkout UI (brand, login, payments, checkout elements, address, coupons) based on the `activeTab` and `customizeUiData` from the Redux store. It simulates a carousel for banners and displays coupon information if applicable.

7.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 29/10/2025, 21:03:41.
    *   **Summary:** This file defines a `RenderForm` component used for rendering various form inputs, particularly for loyalty programs.
        *   **Content:** It includes definitions for loyalty-related inputs such as switches for COD with loyalty, stacking discounts with credits, auto-application of credits, custom display names for reward points, and showing earned loyalty points. It also includes rules for calculating loyalty points (on subtotal vs. to pay) and sales channel control.

8.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 30/10/2025, 10:46:02 and 30/10/2025, 10:49:18.
    *   **Summary:** This `ShippingService` component manages different shipping configuration tabs.
        *   **30/10/2025, 10:49:18:** The "Product Based Shipping" tab is made conditional. It will only be rendered if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is truthy. This introduces dynamic tab visibility based on merchant configuration.
        *   **Overall:** The component organizes different shipping configuration methods (Shipping Method, Product Based, Weight Based, Discount Based) into tabs and handles tab changes by refetching data for the active tab.

9.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Multiple changes between 30/10/2025, 17:52:43 and 30/10/2025, 18:30:51.
    *   **Summary:** This `CreateBulkDiscounts` component provides a drawer interface for creating bulk discount codes, either randomly generated or uploaded via CSV.
        *   **30/10/2025, 17:52:43:** The `awsResponse` for `makeAWSPutCall` in `uploadDiscountCSV` is temporarily commented out and replaced with a `fetch` call with `method: 'PUT'`, and `includeUserIdHeader: true` is commented out. This indicates a change in how files are uploaded to AWS, possibly moving to a simpler `fetch` API directly from the client.
        *   **30/10/2025, 18:19:56:** The `awsResponse` in `uploadDiscountCSV` is restored to `makeAWSPutCall` but with `includeUserIdHeader: false`. The direct `fetch` call is removed. This suggests a reversion to the previous `makeAWSPutCall` but with an explicit change to the `includeUserIdHeader` setting.
        *   **30/10/2025, 18:25:19:** The `if (preSignedURL)` block containing the actual AWS upload logic is commented out, with only `callBack()` being called. This implies that the actual upload to AWS is being bypassed, likely for testing or to defer its implementation, only simulating a successful upload.
        *   **30/10/2025, 18:25:34:** A `console.log("upload")` is added before `callBack()` when the upload logic is commented out, confirming the bypass for debugging.
        *   **30/10/2025, 18:26:49:** The commented-out AWS upload logic within the `if (preSignedURL)` block is uncommented, restoring the actual file upload process. `includeUserIdHeader` is set to `false`.
        *   **30/10/2025, 18:30:51:** The `includeUserIdHeader` for `makeAWSPutCall` is changed back to `true`.
        *   **Overall:** This component handles bulk discount creation. Key features include choosing between random code generation or CSV upload, validating discount set titles against existing rules, calculating minimum code length for random generation, and handling file uploads to AWS S3. There's a noticeable pattern of commenting out/uncommenting the AWS upload logic, suggesting active development, testing, and adjustments to the file upload mechanism, specifically regarding the `includeUserIdHeader` parameter.

10. **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/.env`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 30/10/2025, 07:52:29 and 30/10/2025, 16:50:38.
    *   **Summary:** This environment file configures API base URLs for different environments.
        *   **30/10/2025, 07:52:29:** The `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_BULK_DISCOUNT_URL` are uncommented for the `qa` environment, and commented out for `dev` and `sandbox`.
        *   **30/10/2025, 16:50:38:** The `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_BULK_DISCOUNT_URL` are uncommented for the `sandbox` environment, and commented out for `dev` and `qa`.
        *   **Pattern:** This shows a recurring pattern of switching the active environment configuration (from `qa` to `sandbox`) by commenting/uncommenting specific lines. This is a common practice during development and deployment to point to different API endpoints.

11. **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 30/10/2025, 07:53:01 and 30/10/2025, 16:50:46.
    *   **Summary:** This EJS template configures SystemJS import maps for different deployment environments of the dashboard UI.
        *   **30/10/2025, 07:53:01:** The `qa` environment import map is configured, pointing various `@gokwik` packages to URLs on `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/` (except `@gokwik/configuration` and `@gokwik/checkout` which are local). It also includes `@gokwik/kwikcomm`.
        *   **30/10/2025, 16:50:46:** The `sandbox` environment import map is configured. All `@gokwik` packages are pointed to URLs on `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/` (except `@gokwik/configuration` and `@gokwik/checkout` which are local), and `@gokwik/kwikcomm` is removed.
        *   **Pattern:** Similar to the `.env` file, this demonstrates switching between deployment environments (`qa` to `sandbox`) for loading micro-frontends. The removal of `@gokwik/kwikcomm` in the sandbox configuration at the later timestamp is a specific change.

12. **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 30/10/2025, 18:29:20 and 30/10/2025, 18:30:51.
    *   **Summary:** This file defines API-related logic for discounts, including data mapping and processing.
        *   **Content remains consistent across the provided diffs for this file.** This again suggests minor, non-functional changes or reformatting.
        *   **Overall:** The file contains functions like `assignMatchType`, `editCollectionId`, `mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`, `responseMapCollections`, `responseMapProducts`, and `mapProducts`, which are used to transform and process discount-related data, particularly for product and collection-based discounts and their interaction with Shopify IDs. It defines the structure for `requestMapDiscount` used for setting up and managing various discount types.

### Recurring Elements and Patterns:

*   **Environment Switching:** A clear pattern of switching between `qa` and `sandbox` environments is observed in both `.env` and `index.ejs` files, highlighting a typical development workflow involving different deployment targets.
*   **UI Customization Refinement:** In `loginPage.tsx` and `index.ts` (customize-ui store), there's a recurring theme of refactoring UI elements (like banners, CTA buttons, consent sections) to be more modular (using `RenderField`) and adding detailed control options (e.g., `is_consent_auto_select`). Renaming `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible` in the Redux store and then in the UI components demonstrates a consistent refactoring effort across layers.
*   **Debugging/Testing Iterations:** The repeated commenting out and uncommenting of `saveConfig` and AWS upload logic in `productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, along with added `console.log` statements, indicate active development, testing, and debugging cycles for critical functionalities related to data persistence and file uploads.
*   **Shipping Configuration Focus:** Multiple files (`shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `shippingBasedData.tsx`, `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `shippingBasedService.tsx`) revolve around configuring various shipping methods (price-based, product-based, weight-based, discount-based). This suggests a significant area of development effort focused on flexible and complex shipping rule management.
*   **Error Handling and Validation:** Many code snippets include explicit `message.error` calls for various validation failures (e.g., empty fields, incorrect file formats, name conflicts, impossible code generation combinations), indicating a strong focus on robust input validation and user feedback.
*   **Use of `gokwik-ui-kit`:** All frontend files extensively import components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (Button, Form, Card, Switch, Input, Table, etc.), showing reliance on a shared UI library for consistency and rapid development.
*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Functions often involve `async/await` for API calls (`makeAPICall`, `makeAWSPutCall`), indicating interaction with backend services for data fetching and persistence.

## 12:01:37
The provided log details changes exclusively to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

The initial versions of the Dockerfile, recorded on 28/10/2025 at 12:27:10, 12:27:41, and 12:29:42, were identical. They defined a multi-stage-like build process starting with `node:20-alpine`, setting the working directory to `/app`, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json`, installing dependencies using `RUN npm install -f`, copying the rest of the application, generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`, building the application with `npm run build`, exposing port 3000, and starting it with `npm start`.

A significant update occurred on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21. The only change introduced was in the dependency installation step: `RUN npm install -f` was modified to `RUN npm install`. This indicates a shift from a potentially forceful or less strict dependency installation to the standard `npm install` command.

Across all timestamps, the Dockerfile consistently follows a standard pattern for building and deploying a Node.js application, including steps for dependency management, Prisma schema generation, and application build/start. The base image `node:20-alpine` and the application port `3000` remained constant throughout the changes.

## 12:02:00
Changes primarily involve UI customization, shipping rule management, and bulk discount creation components.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
Across multiple timestamps (e.g., `29/10/2025, 15:24:36` to `30/10/2025, 11:00:27`), the code content remained identical, indicating no functional or structural changes were committed to this specific file during the logged period.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
*   **29/10/2025, 17:22:56**: A local variable `previousShippingId` was introduced.
*   **29/10/2025, 17:29:02**: `previousShippingId` was refactored from a simple local variable to a React state variable using `useState`. This change suggests an intent to persist or react to changes in the previously selected shipping ID.
The code content then remained consistent in subsequent entries for this file.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
This file saw frequent modifications, primarily related to debugging and refining the logic for saving product-based shipping rules.
*   **29/10/2025, 16:46:10**: Functionality to save configuration and reset form fields was uncommented, then temporarily commented out again at **16:47:58**, along with several data processing and validation lines.
*   **29/10/2025, 16:51:11**: The previously commented-out save logic and data processing were re-enabled.
*   **29/10/2025, 17:00:25** to **17:11:50**: Several `console.log` statements were added and subsequently removed for debugging `targetedShipping` and `formValues`. The `saveConfig` block was toggled between commented and uncommented states during this period.
*   **29/10/2025, 17:23:01**: The component started receiving `previousShippingId` from the `processProductBasedShippingData` utility.
*   **29/10/2025, 17:25:08**: New logic was added to conditionally delete `product_based_rules` from the `targetedShipping` object if an edit operation is active and a `previousShippingId` exists, indicating handling for rule modifications.
*   **29/10/2025, 17:30:43**: The `saveConfig` block and related cleanup functions were consistently uncommented and enabled.
*   **30/10/2025, 10:35:02** and **10:36:15**: `console.log` statements were temporarily added to observe `shippingPrices` and `config?.shipping_prices` within the `useEffect` hook.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
This Redux slice for UI customization was updated to include new options.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:05:03**: A new property `is_consent_auto_select: true` was added to `login_data` in the `initialState`.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:27:17**: The property `is_consent_required` within `login_data` in `initialState` was renamed to `isConsentVisible`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
This file underwent extensive refactoring to consolidate and improve the UI configuration for the login page.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:17:05**: The "Primary Button" configuration, initially a separate `Card`, began to be integrated into a dynamic `fields` array using `RenderField`.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:18:16**: Each field rendered from the `fields` array was wrapped in its own `Card` component for consistent styling.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:19:02**: Redundant form items related to the "Primary Button" were removed, streamlining the UI structure.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:19:30** to **18:21:54**: Minor styling adjustments were made to text elements, specifically related to font weight.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:23:18**: The entire "Primary Button" section, including its switch and input, was fully integrated into the `fields` array as a custom render function.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**
A single snapshot was provided on `29/10/2025, 21:03:41`. It defines various form input configurations (e.g., loyalty points, EDD, pincode serviceability) and utility components for rendering forms dynamically. It includes tooltips for user guidance and API integration details. No incremental changes were observed in the log.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
*   **30/10/2025, 16:50:46**: For the `isLocal` development environment, the `systemjs-importmap` configuration was updated. Several `@gokwik` module URLs (e.g., `@gokwik/utilities`, `@gokwik/dashboard`, `@gokwik/payment`) were changed from referencing `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`. This indicates a switch in the local development setup to use sandbox versions of these dashboard modules.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
This component handles the creation of bulk discount codes.

*   **30/10/2025, 18:25:34**: A `console.log("upload")` statement was added for debugging the upload flow.
*   **30/10/2025, 18:30:51**: The `makeAWSPutCall` and its success check were uncommented, restoring the AWS upload functionality, with `includeUserIdHeader` set back to `true`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
A single snapshot was provided on `30/10/2025, 18:29:20`. It defines API interaction logic and data mapping functions for discount management, including `customerEligibility`, `assignMatchType`, `mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`, and `requestMapDiscount`. No incremental changes were observed in the log.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Form Management:** Extensive use of `Form.useForm()`, `Form.useWatch()`, `form.setFieldsValue()`, `form.submit()`, `form.resetFields()`, and dynamic field rendering with `RenderField` is prevalent across `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `loginPage.tsx`, and `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`. This indicates a standardized approach to handling form states and inputs.
*   **UI Components from `gokwik-ui-kit`:** Components like `Button`, `Card`, `Col`, `Input`, `Switch`, `Table`, `Drawer`, `message`, `Tooltip`, `Radio`, `Select`, `DatePicker`, `InputNumber`, `Divider`, `Row`, `Space`, `Carousel`, and `Skeleton` are frequently used, pointing to a consistent UI library usage.
*   **State Management:** React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are widely used for local component state, along with Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`, `updateLoginData`) for global state management, particularly in the `customize-ui` and `shipping` modules.
*   **API Interaction:** Repeated use of `makeAPICall`, `makeAWSPutCall`, and `APIEndPoints` suggests a centralized utility for handling API requests and file uploads (especially CSVs for cohorts/pincodes in `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` and ZIP/CSV for bulk discounts in `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`).
*   **Debugging Practices:** Frequent commenting/uncommenting of code blocks and adding `console.log` statements are observed, particularly in `productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, indicating active development and troubleshooting.
*   **UI Customization Logic:** The `loginPage.tsx` and `customize-ui/index.ts` show a pattern of making UI elements configurable (banners, CTA text, consent sections) with switches and rich text editors (`RenderEditorFunction`, `BannerComponentRendrer`).
*   **Shipping Configuration:** A recurring theme across shipping-related files is the management of different shipping rule types (method, product-based, weight-based, discount-based) and the complex logic for their configuration, validation, and interaction.
*   **Environment Configuration:** The `index.ejs` file shows a pattern of using `deployedEnv` variables to dynamically load different versions of `@gokwik` modules (e.g., `qa`, `sandbox`) based on the deployment environment, which is also reflected in the `.env` file for API base URLs.

It also features API calls for signed URLs and customer segment fetching.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
    *   Initial code on 29/10/2025, 16:43:05 did not manage a `previousShippingId` state.
    *   On 29/10/2025, 17:22:56, a local variable `previousShippingId` was introduced.
    *   A significant change occurred on 29/10/2025, 17:29:02, converting `previousShippingId` to a proper React state variable using `useState`.
    *   Subsequent entries on 30/10/2025 showed no further functional changes in the provided content. This file defines logic for processing product-based shipping data, including mapping items, handling selected options, and displaying tables of products/collections.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
    *   This component, `ProductBasedShipping`, underwent frequent modifications between 29/10/2025 (16:45:25) and 30/10/2025 (11:01:12).
    *   Several changes involved toggling (commenting/uncommenting) the form submission and save logic within `handleFormSubmit`, suggesting active debugging and development. Console logs (`targetedShipping`, `formValues`, `shippingPrices`, `previousShippingId`) were added and removed for inspection.
    *   On 29/10/2025, 17:23:01, it started receiving `previousShippingId` as a prop, aligning with the change in `shippingBasedData.tsx`.
    *   Logic was added on 29/10/2025, 17:25:08 to delete `product_based_rules` from a previous shipping configuration when a rule is re-mapped during editing.
    *   By 30/10/2025, 11:01:12, the save logic for `shipping_prices` was consistently uncommented and active, indicating a stable state for the submission functionality.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   On 29/10/2025, 18:05:03, `is_consent_auto_select: true` was added to the `login_data` in the Redux `initialState`.
    *   On 29/10/2025, 18:27:17, `is_consent_required` was renamed to `isConsentVisible` in the `login_data` object of the `initialState`.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
    *   This login page customization component saw extensive refactoring and additions between 29/10/2025 (18:09:05) and 18:58:39.
    *   Early changes involved moving UI elements (like "Primary Button") into a generic `fields` array and then consolidating their rendering logic using `RenderField` and `Card` components (e.g., 18:17:05, 18:18:16, 18:23:18, 18:23:38).
    *   On 29/10/2025, 18:27:00, the property `is_consent_required` was renamed to `isConsentVisible` to match the Redux store update.
    *   Further enhancements on 29/10/2025, 18:39:37, 18:44:05 introduced `BannerComponentRendrer` for the "Consent Section" and added a new `is_consent_auto_select` switch with its corresponding description and initial value (18:46:01).
    *   A validation check for an empty primary button text was added on 29/10/2025, 18:58:39.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   All entries for this file across 29/10/2025 (18:48:04) to 29/10/2025 (19:03:58) show identical code, indicating no functional changes in the provided snippets. This component provides a mobile UI preview and dynamically adjusts based on the active customization tab.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   On 30/10/2025, 16:50:46, the import map for the `isLocal` environment was updated. Several `@gokwik` micro-frontend modules (e.g., `utilities`, `dashboard`, `payment`, `kwikpass`, `rto`, `kwikship`, `ellora`, `checkout-platform`, `shopify-app`) were redirected from `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`. The `@gokwik/checkout` module, however, remained pointing to `//localhost:9002/gokwik-checkout.js`.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   On 30/10/2025, 10:49:18, the "Product Based Shipping" tab in the UI was made conditionally rendered, appearing only if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is enabled.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   This component, `CreateBulkDiscounts`, saw changes in its file upload mechanism between 30/10/2025 (17:52:43) and 18:26:49.
    *   Initially, a direct `fetch` call with `includeUserIdHeader: true` was used for AWS S3 upload (17:52:43).
    *   This was reverted to `makeAWSPutCall` with `includeUserIdHeader: false` on 30/10/2025, 18:19:56.
    *   The `makeAWSPutCall` block was commented out again on 30/10/2025, 18:25:19, temporarily disabling the actual file upload, with a `console.log("upload")` added at 18:25:34.
    *   The `makeAWSPutCall` was then uncommented again by 30/10/2025, 18:26:49, reinstating the file upload functionality with `includeUserIdHeader: false`.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   Only one log entry for this file (30/10/2025, 18:29:20) is provided, detailing API-related helpers for discount management. No comparative changes are available.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Active Development & Debugging**: Frequent commenting/uncommenting of code blocks and the addition/removal of `console.log` statements (e.g., `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`) indicate active development cycles, including testing and debugging of new or modified features.
2.  **UI Configuration and Refactoring**: There's a strong pattern of refactoring UI components and state management, particularly visible in `loginPage.tsx` and `customize-ui/index.ts`. This includes moving specific UI sections into more generic rendering structures (`fields` array, `RenderField`) and centralizing UI state in a Redux store.
3.  **Deployment Environment Management**: The `index.ejs` file shows adjustments to how different micro-frontends are sourced based on the deployment environment (local, QA, sandbox), which is crucial for managing application composition across stages.
4.  **Feature Flagging/Conditional Rendering**: The conditional inclusion of the "Product Based Shipping" tab in `shippingBasedService.tsx` based on `merchantConfig` suggests a system for enabling/disabling features for merchants.
5.  **Form Validation**: Client-side form validation is consistently applied across various forms (e.g., `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, `loginPage.tsx`) using `Form.Item` rules and custom validators to ensure data integrity.
6.  **File Upload and API Integration**: The `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` and `createBulkDiscounts.tsx` files demonstrate robust file upload functionality, including pre-signed URL generation and direct AWS S3 uploads, integrated with backend APIs (`makeAPICall`, `makeAWSPutCall`).
7.  **Consistent UI Library Usage**: The `gokwik-ui-kit` is a ubiquitous dependency across the UI components, enforcing a consistent look and feel throughout the dashboard.

        *   **Key Change**: The "Product Based Shipping" tab (`key: '2'`) was made conditional. It will only be rendered if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is enabled (30/10/2025, 10:49:18), making it an opt-in feature.

10. **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp**: Iterative changes from 30/10/2025, 17:52:43, to 30/10/2025, 18:30:51.
    *   **Updates**: This component facilitates the creation of bulk discount codes.
        *   **Key Change**: The `uploadDiscountCSV` function, which handles uploading CSV files to AWS S3, underwent changes regarding the `includeUserIdHeader` property in `makeAWSPutCall`. It was set to `true`, then `false`, and at one point the `makeAWSPutCall` was commented out in favor of a raw `fetch` PUT request, which was also later commented out, indicating active debugging or changes in the S3 interaction strategy (30/10/2025, 18:19:56 and 18:25:19). A `console.log("upload")` was also added (30/10/2025, 18:25:34).

11. **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 30/10/2025, 18:29:20 and 30/10/2025, 18:30:51.
    *   **Updates**: This file contains API mapping logic for discounts.
        *   **Key Change**: `makeAWSPutCall`'s `includeUserIdHeader` was changed from `true` to `false` in `requestMapDiscount` (30/10/2025, 18:30:51), mirroring a similar adjustment in the `createBulkDiscounts.tsx` component.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **UI/UX Customization Focus**: A recurring theme is the granular control given to merchants over checkout UI elements (banners, CTA text, consent options, shipping rules).
*   **State Management with Redux and React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useAppDispatch`, and `useSelector` are extensively used across components, along with `gokwik-ui-kit`'s `Form` and `Form.useWatch` for form management and real-time UI updates.
*   **API Interaction for Configuration**: `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` are standard methods for data fetching and uploading configurations.
*   **AWS S3 Uploads**: There's a pattern of changes related to S3 file uploads, particularly concerning the `includeUserIdHeader` flag, suggesting a focused effort on refining or debugging file transfer security/authentication.
*   **Debugging Statements**: The frequent appearance and removal/commenting of `console.log` statements across different files indicate an active development and debugging environment.
*   **Modular Design**: The use of utility functions (`processProductBasedShippingData`, `RenderEditorFunction`) and dedicated API files (`api.ts`) points to a modular codebase.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: Multiple commits within minutes or seconds on the same file suggest a developer making quick iterative changes, possibly saving frequently or using auto-save features.
*   **Conditional Feature Rollout**: The conditional rendering of "Product Based Shipping" hints at features being rolled out or managed based on specific merchant configurations.

## 16:01:39
The provided logs detail changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile**:
    *   The Dockerfile consistently uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image, sets the working directory to `/app`, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` files for dependency caching, copies the entire application, generates the Prisma schema (`npx prisma generate`), builds the application (`npm run build`), exposes port `3000`, and starts the application with `npm start`.
    *   **Timestamp of significant change**: 29/10/2025, 23:35:21.
    *   **Details of change**: The command for installing dependencies was modified from `RUN npm install -f` (which forces installation) to `RUN npm install`. The previous versions of the Dockerfile on 28/10/2025 (at 12:27:10, 12:27:41, and 12:29:42) all used `npm install -f`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All entries describe a Dockerfile for a Node.js application, likely a "mint-dashboard" given the path.
*   The core build process—installing dependencies, generating Prisma schema, building the app, and exposing port 3000—remains constant across all versions.
*   The change from `npm install -f` to `npm install` suggests a refinement in how dependencies are managed, moving from a forceful installation to a standard one, possibly after resolving initial dependency issues or ensuring a clean `package-lock.json`.

## 16:02:06
The provided log details code changes across several UI and backend-related files, primarily focusing on shipping settings, UI customization, and bulk discount management.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**: This file experienced numerous save operations between October 29th and 30th, 2025. However, the code content remained largely identical across these timestamps, suggesting frequent minor saves, formatting changes, or non-functional modifications. The core logic for defining shipping prices, minimum/maximum order values, and advanced conditions, including CSV uploads for pincodes and cohorts, remained stable.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**:
    *   **October 29, 2025, 17:29:02**: A significant refactoring occurred where the `previousShippingId` variable was transitioned from a local `let` variable (initially uninitialized, then set to `null`) to a state variable managed by `useState`. This change likely aimed to ensure proper state persistence and reactivity within the component.
    *   Other timestamps for this file (e.g., 29/10/2025, 16:43:05, 17:22:56, and several on 30/10/2025) show minor adjustments around this state management refinement.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**:
    *   **October 29, 2025, 16:46:10 and 17:30:43**: The `handleFormSubmit` function's core logic for saving configurations and resetting the form was repeatedly commented out and then re-enabled. This indicates an iterative testing and debugging cycle during development.
    *   **October 29, 2025, 17:25:08**: New logic was introduced within `handleFormSubmit` to manage product-based shipping rules during edits. Specifically, if a rule is being edited (`open` and `previousShippingId` are true), existing `product_based_rules` are explicitly deleted before new ones are assigned, preventing conflicts or duplicates.
    *   **October 29, 2025, 17:23:01**: The `processProductBasedShippingData` call was updated to correctly destructure `previousShippingId`.
    *   **October 30, 2025, 10:35:02 and 10:36:15**: Console logs were added/removed to inspect `shippingPrices` and `config?.shipping_prices`.

    *   **October 29, 2025, 18:05:03**: A new boolean property, `is_consent_auto_select: true`, was added to the `login_data` object in the Redux slice's initial state.
    *   **October 29, 2025, 18:27:17**: The existing `is_consent_required` property within `login_data` was renamed to `isConsentVisible`, signifying an update in UI consent handling.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**:
    *   **October 29, 2025, 18:17:05 to 18:26:23**: The structure of form fields for "Primary Button" and "Consent Section" underwent several refactorings, moving between inline JSX and a `fields` array using `type: 'switch'` or `type: 'custom'` render functions. This suggests ongoing UI design and implementation adjustments.
    *   **October 29, 2025, 18:27:00**: The component was updated to use the new `isConsentVisible` property, aligning with the Redux state change.
    *   **October 29, 2025, 18:39:37 and 18:44:05**: The "Consent Section" was further enhanced with a new `is_consent_auto_select` switch and integrated `BannerComponentRendrer` for dynamic content display.
    *   **October 29, 2025, 18:58:39**: New validation logic was introduced in `handleFormSubmit` to prevent saving if the primary button text is empty when the button is visible.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**: Similar to `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, this file showed many identical code snapshots across October 29th, 2025, indicating minor, non-functional changes or frequent saves.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**: A single entry for this file on October 29, 2025, 21:03:41, provides a comprehensive overview of form fields and related logic for various integration settings (e.g., loyalty, EDD, pincode). No specific changes are identifiable within this single snapshot.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**:
    *   **October 30, 2025, 16:50:46**: The import map for the `isLocal` environment was updated. Specifically, `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` now point to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/` instead of `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**:
    *   **October 30, 2025, 10:49:18**: The `tabsList` was modified to conditionally include the "Product Based Shipping" tab based on the `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` flag, enabling feature toggling.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**:
    *   **October 30, 2025, 17:52:43 to 18:26:49**: This file shows frequent and rapid changes in the `uploadDiscountCSV` function. This included switching between `makeAWSPutCall` (with varying `includeUserIdHeader` values) and a direct `fetch` call for file uploads, and repeatedly commenting/uncommenting the actual upload execution. This intense activity suggests active debugging and refinement of the bulk discount CSV upload mechanism.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**: A single entry on October 30, 2025, 18:29:20, provides a snapshot of the `requestMapDiscount` object, which contains logic for mapping and setting up various discount configurations, including complex rules for products and collections.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **October 29, 2025 (late afternoon/evening)**: Intense development and refactoring around UI customization (`loginPage.tsx`, `customize-ui/index.ts`) and shipping rule logic (`shippingBasedData.tsx`, `productBasaedShipping.tsx`).
*   **October 30, 2025 (morning)**: Changes related to conditional shipping tab rendering (`shippingBasedService.tsx`) and environment configuration (`index.ejs`).
*   **October 30, 2025 (late afternoon/evening)**: Focused debugging and re-implementation of the bulk discount file upload functionality (`createBulkDiscounts.tsx`).

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging**: Several files (`productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, `loginPage.tsx`) show patterns of code being commented out, modified, and then re-enabled, often accompanied by `console.log` statements. This indicates a highly iterative development and debugging process.

    *   (Oct 29, 2025, 18:05:03) A typo (`is_ isContinueButtonVisible`) was corrected to `isContinueButtonVisible` in the `login_data` initial state. A new boolean property, `is_consent_auto_select: true`, was added to the `login_data` object, enhancing consent management features.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
    *   (Oct 29, 2025, 18:17:05 to 18:26:23) Extensive refactoring to modularize UI components: the "Banner", "Primary Button", and "Consent Section" elements were progressively moved from direct JSX rendering into a `fields` array for dynamic rendering via `RenderField`.
    *   (Oct 29, 2025, 18:27:00) The `is_consent_required` property was renamed to `isConsentVisible` in both the initial state and its usage in the `RenderEditorFunction` for the consent section.
    *   (Oct 29, 2025, 18:39:37 & 18:44:05) The "Consent Section" rendering was further customized to include an "Auto-select offers and updates consent box" switch (`is_consent_auto_select`) and now uses `BannerComponentRendrer` for the text content. `BannerComponentRendrer` was also newly imported.
    *   (Oct 29, 2025, 18:46:01) The `initialValues` were updated to reflect `is_consent_auto_select: true`.
    *   (Oct 29, 2025, 18:58:39) New validation logic was added to `handleFormSubmit` to prevent saving if the "Continue" button is visible but has no text.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   (Oct 29, 2025, 18:48:04 to 19:03:58) All provided code snippets for this mobile UI preview component are identical. This component dynamically renders various UI elements (logo, status indicators, banners, coupon sections) based on the active tab and Redux store data.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**
    *   (Oct 29, 2025, 21:03:41) The `loyaltyInputs` array was updated to define comprehensive fields for loyalty program configuration, including enabling COD with loyalty, stacking with manual discounts, auto-application, custom display names, earned loyalty points display rules, and sales channel control.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   (Oct 30, 2025, 16:50:46) For the `isLocal` environment, the import map URLs for several `@gokwik` microfrontends (e.g., `utilities`, `payment`, `kwikpass`, `rto`, `kwikship`, `ellora`, `checkout-platform`, `shopify-app`) were updated to point to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` instead of `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`. This signifies a shift in local development dependencies.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   (Oct 30, 2025, 10:49:18) The "Product Based Shipping" tab was made conditionally visible, dependent on `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` being enabled. This introduces feature flagging for this specific shipping method.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   (Oct 30, 2025, 18:19:56) The `uploadDiscountCSV` function's `makeAWSPutCall` had `includeUserIdHeader` changed from `true` to `false`.
    *   (Oct 30, 2025, 18:25:19) The `makeAWSPutCall` block within `uploadDiscountCSV` was commented out, effectively disabling the S3 upload.
    *   (Oct 30, 2025, 18:25:34) A `console.log("upload")` was added for debugging purposes.
    *   (Oct 30, 2025, 18:26:49) The `makeAWSPutCall` logic was uncommented, reactivating the AWS S3 file upload with `includeUserIdHeader: false`. This shows a period of debugging for the file upload mechanism.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   (Oct 30, 2025, 18:29:20) This file defines API helper functions for discounts. Notably, the `mapProducts` function includes complex logic (`compareProductArrays`, `handleVariantMismatch`) for processing and comparing product/variant IDs in discount rules, suggesting sophisticated handling of product-based discount conditions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Debugging & Iteration:** Frequent commenting/uncommenting of code, especially for `saveConfig` and logging statements (`console.log`) in `productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, indicates an active and iterative development process, likely involving testing and refinement of new features.
2.  **UI Modularization & Customization:** There's a clear pattern of refactoring UI elements into a `fields` array for dynamic rendering using `RenderField` in `loginPage.tsx`. New customization options, particularly for consent management on the login page (e.g., auto-select, visibility), were added and refined.
3.  **Feature Flagging:** The introduction of conditional rendering for the "Product Based Shipping" tab in `shippingBasedService.tsx` demonstrates a strategy for controlled rollout or merchant-specific feature enablement.
4.  **Environment Configuration Shift:** Changes in `.env` and `index.ejs` indicate a shift in the local development environment's backend dependencies from QA to Sandbox for several microfrontends.
5.  **AWS S3 Upload Adjustments:** Specific modifications to the `makeAWSPutCall` parameters and temporary disabling in `createBulkDiscounts.tsx` suggest fine-tuning or troubleshooting of the file upload process to AWS S3.

# Activity Summary for 30/10/2025

## 09:48:45
The log details changes exclusively to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The Dockerfile outlines the steps for containerizing a Node.js application. It consistently uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image, sets the working directory to `/app`, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` before installing dependencies for caching efficiency, copies the entire application, generates the Prisma schema (`npx prisma generate`), builds the application (`npm run build`), exposes port 3000, and starts the application with `npm start`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The most significant change occurred on **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**. At this point, the `npm install` command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This indicates a deliberate removal of the `force` flag during dependency installation. The earlier entries (28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; 28/10/2025, 12:29:42) showed the Dockerfile in a state where `npm install` was executed with the `-f` flag.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
A strong pattern throughout the logs is the stability of the Dockerfile's overall structure and most commands. The base image, working directory setup, `openssl` installation, staged copying of package files, Prisma generation, build command, port exposure, and start command remained identical across all recorded versions. The only divergence was the presence or absence of the `-f` flag for `npm install`.

## 09:48:55
The provided log details changes across three files in the `gokwik.pdp` project: `EnvironmentService.ts`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, and `Merchant.svelte`, along with `public/merchant.html` and `Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`, and `Components/login/MobilePhoneInput.svelte`.

**File-specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 27/10/2025, 23:32:07; 27/10/2025, 23:32:18; 28/10/2025, 13:28:57; 28/10/2025, 13:29:25; 29/10/2025, 11:01:39; 29/10/2025, 11:01:51; 29/10/2025, 12:14:15; 29/10/2025, 12:14:26; 29/10/2025, 20:21:25; 29/10/2025, 20:21:37.
    *   **Key Changes:** This file is responsible for determining various API and CDN URLs based on the current environment (`env`).
        *   **Local Environment API URL Adjustments:** Multiple changes were observed in the `api_url` function, specifically for the `local` environment. The commented-out URLs indicate various testing configurations, and the active `url` for `local` was toggled between `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` and `https://api.gokwik.co` and then finally to `https://dev-core-api.dev.gokwik.in` across the different timestamps.
        *   **`setCart` Function Updates:** The `setCart` function, which initializes `store_cartjsObject`, had its JSON payload updated multiple times. This payload contains detailed cart information, including a `token`, `note`, `attributes`, `total_price`, `item_count`, and `items` array. The product details (e.g., "5 Pocket Jean final very good jeans," "Lazy Days Brown Oversized Printed Exclusive Shirt," "7 Shakra Bracelet - Blue") and associated prices, discounts, and attributes within this JSON changed. These changes reflect modifications to the default or testing cart data.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 28/10/2025, 14:40:38; 28/10/2025, 14:41:10; 28/10/2025, 14:41:56; 28/10/2025, 14:43:25; 28/10/2025, 15:13:09; 28/10/2025, 15:22:05; 28/10/2025, 15:23:42; 28/10/2025, 15:51:04; 28/10/2025, 15:51:29; 28/10/2025, 15:54:40; 28/10/2025, 15:54:59; 28/10/2025, 16:09:27; 28/10/2025, 16:12:33; 28/10/2025, 16:13:46; 29/10/2025, 12:47:42; 29/10/2025, 12:48:14.
    *   **Key Changes:** This file manages external analytics integrations.
        *   **New Store Imports:** A new import `store_isSkipOtp` was added from `../stores/LoginStore` (28/10/2025, 15:22:05). Later, `store_page` was imported from `../stores/LoginStore` (28/10/2025, 15:51:04) and `store_ppCodAmount` and `store_priceBreakUp` were imported from `../../common/stores/OrderStore` (29/10/2025, 12:47:42).
        *   **Variable Declarations:** Corresponding `let pageNumber;` and `let mobileApp = false, isPpcod, isTotalPayableAmount;` variables were added, reflecting the new store imports.
        *   **Subscription Logic:** New `store_isSkipOtp.subscribe` and `store_page.subscribe` calls were introduced. The `store_page` subscription (28/10/2025, 15:51:04 to 28/10/2025, 16:13:46) initially included a `console.log` to monitor page changes. This `console.log` was later removed as the `pageNumber` variable was introduced for tracking (28/10/2025, 15:54:59).
        *   **Merge Conflict Resolution:** A merge conflict block (`<<<<<<< HEAD`, `=======`, `>>>>>>> 6690eb2a76be43b97eac4890686ca555beeada10`) was observed and resolved (29/10/2025, 12:48:14). This resolved conflicting subscriptions for `store_ppCodAmount` and `store_page`. The final version includes subscriptions for both.
        *   **Debugging Statements:** Temporary `console.log("Token Is Visible ==> ",res)` statements were added and removed in the `store_localStorageObject` subscription, indicating debugging activities (28/10/2025, 15:13:09 to 28/10/2025, 16:13:46).

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 28/10/2025, 14:44:14.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **New Imports:** `calledgeTag` from `./Analytics/edgetag` and `callCustomerLabEvents` from `./Analytics/CustomerLabs` were added, along with `callShopifyAnalytics` and `stabilityEvent`.
        *   **Truecaller Config:** A `truecallerConfig` object was updated to include a `qatwo` environment with a new key `jNOxM140989a6a5e94de3bd265c370bc4f88a`.
        *   **Checkout Anywhere Feature:** A new `checkoutAnywhere` boolean variable was introduced, along with logic to set it to `true` if `gkref` query parameter is present.
        *   **Merchant ID Update:** The `window.merchantInfo.mid` in the script block was changed to `'1o0jov7jskptrcc74'` (29/10/2025, 20:22:08).

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 29/10/2025, 11:02:27; 29/10/2025, 20:22:08.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **`merchantInfo` `mid` Update:** The `mid` value within the `window.merchantInfo` object in the embedded script was changed from `'19g6iluth15o0'` to `'1o0jov7jskptrcc74'` (29/10/2025, 20:22:08). This is a merchant-specific identifier, indicating a change in the target merchant for local development/testing.

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 29/10/2025, 11:24:02; 29/10/2025, 11:25:19; 29/10/2025, 11:25:27; 29/10/2025, 11:29:27; 29/10/2025, 11:29:33.
    *   **Key Changes:** This file handles discount logic.
        *   **`isPromotionalDiscount()` function added:** A reactive statement `$: isPromotionalDiscount();` was added, implying a new function or computed property to determine if a promotional discount is active.
        *   **Conditional `onRemove` for Stacked Discounts:** The logic for `onRemove` within `allAppliedOffers` for `stackedDiscountConfig` was updated. It now conditionally uses an empty string `''` if `creditsApplied` is true and `disable_discount_with_credits` is not false, otherwise uses `couponField`. This suggests an interaction between credits and discount removal in stacked scenarios.

6.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/MobilePhoneInput.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 29/10/2025, 20:30:41; 29/10/2025, 20:34:26; 29/10/2025, 20:36:31; 29/10/2025, 20:37:24; 29/10/2025, 20:38:04; 29/10/2025, 20:38:37; 29/10/2025, 20:39:23; 29/10/2025, 20:41:43; 29/10/2025, 20:44:39; 29/10/2025, 20:44:44; 29/10/2025, 20:44:55.
    *   **Key Changes:** This component handles mobile phone input and user login.
        *   **Consent Auto-selection:** A new `isCheckboxSelected` variable was introduced and its value is set from `res?.custom_config?.login_data?.is_consent_auto_select` within the `store_requestIdObject` subscription. Initially, it defaulted to `true` if not found (29/10/2025, 20:30:41), then later changed to only assign if the key `is_consent_auto_select` exists in the `login_data` (29/10/2025, 20:44:39).
        *   **Removed Unsubscribe:** The `unsubscribeReqIdObj` was initially being unsubscribed unconditionally in `onDestroy`, but this was later changed to `unsubscribeReqIdObj && unsubscribeReqIdObj()` (29/10/2025, 20:38:04), making it conditional. This pattern was also applied to `unsubscribeTotalPrice`.
        *   **Minor Variable Changes:** `isCheckboxSelected` was temporarily removed and then re-added, along with associated logic (29/10/2025, 20:37:24 to 29/10/2025, 20:44:39).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment-based Configuration:** A strong recurring pattern is the use of an `env` variable (environment) to dynamically configure URLs and tokens for different deployment stages (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local, hdev, ndev, idev, qatwo, qa-rto, qaone, dev-core, qa-core, sandbox-core, pci-prod). This is evident across all the `EnvironmentService.ts` changes.
*   **Store Subscriptions:** Many files extensively use Svelte stores (`store_discountCode`, `store_merchantUserType`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_requestIdObject`, etc.) to manage and react to application state changes. This is prominent in `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Discounts.svelte`, and `MobilePhoneInput.svelte`.
*   **Analytics and Event Logging:** There's a consistent focus on analytics, with various functions for `fireAnalyticsGa4`, `logEvent`, `fireGtmEvent`, and calls to different analytics pixels (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Wigzo, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds). The `ForeignAnalytics.ts` file is a central point for this.
*   **Checkout Flow Logic:** The updates show continuous refinement of the checkout UI/UX, including handling of discounts, addressing, user login (OTP, Kwikpass), and payment methods. The interaction between various stores and services to manage this complex flow is a dominant theme.
*   **Debugging and Code Refinement:** The presence of commented-out code, temporary `console.log` statements, and the resolution of merge conflicts indicate active development and debugging.
*   **Cookie and Local Storage Management:** Functions like `getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`, `localStorage.setItem` are used to persist data across sessions, particularly for merchant information, cart data, and user-specific details.
*   **Dynamic UI Elements based on Merchant Config:** Features like `disable_discount_with_credits`, `disable_discount_with_giftcard`, `loyalty_app_v2`, `notificationCheckCompulsory`, `is_consent_auto_select` show that the UI behavior can be tailored based on merchant-specific configurations fetched through `store_requestIdObject` or `store_merchantInfo`.

## 10:48:38
The provided log details changes exclusively to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The `Dockerfile` consistently defines a build process for a Node.js application. It uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image, sets the working directory to `/app`, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` files to leverage Docker caching, installs dependencies, copies the rest of the application code, generates the Prisma schema (`npx prisma generate`), builds the application (`npm run build`), exposes port `3000`, and sets `npm start` as the command to run the application.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
*   On `28/10/2025`, multiple entries at `12:27:10`, `12:27:41`, and `12:29:42` show the Dockerfile with the dependency installation command as `RUN npm install -f`. These entries appear to be minor saves or identical snapshots.
*   A significant change occurred on `29/10/2025, 23:35:21`. At this timestamp, the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
The overall structure and sequence of commands in the `Dockerfile` remain consistent across all entries, indicating a stable deployment configuration. The repeated steps include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base.
*   Setting `/app` as the `WORKDIR`.
*   Installing `openssl`.
*   Copying `package*.json` before other files.
*   Generating Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application with `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port `3000`.
*   Starting the application with `npm start`.

The primary modification observed is a subtle but important change in how Node.js dependencies are installed.

## 10:48:48
The provided log details code changes across three files in the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/` directory, specifically `src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, `src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`, and `src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`, and `src/Components/login/MobilePhoneInput.svelte` from October 27, 2025, to October 30, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 27/10/2025, 23:32:07; 27/10/2025, 23:32:18; 28/10/2025, 13:28:57; 28/10/2025, 13:29:25; 29/10/2025, 11:01:39; 29/10/2025, 11:01:51; 29/10/2025, 12:14:15; 29/10/2025, 12:14:26; 29/10/2025, 20:21:25; 29/10/2025, 20:21:37; 30/10/2025, 09:51:11.
    *   **Key Changes:** This file is responsible for defining base URLs and tokens based on the environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`, etc.). The most frequent changes occur within the `api_url()` and `setCart()` functions.
        *   **`api_url()`:** The URL for the `local` environment is frequently commented out and changed. It was initially set to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`, then changed to `https://api.gokwik.co`, back to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`, and finally to `https://dev-core-api.dev.gokwik.in`. This indicates active development and testing of different API endpoints for the local environment.
        *   **`setCart()`:** This function updates `store_cartjsObject` with a hardcoded cart JSON. The `token` and `item` details within this JSON are frequently modified across commits. This suggests ongoing testing with different cart configurations and discount scenarios. For instance, the `total_price` and `total_discount` (and `discounts` array) are altered multiple times.
        *   **Other functions:** `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `getCredUrl`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`, `merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`, `XGokwikToken`, and `XKWIKPASSToken` remain largely consistent, primarily mapping URLs or tokens to various environments.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 28/10/2025, 14:40:38; 28/10/2025, 14:41:10; 28/10/2025, 14:41:56; 28/10/2025, 14:43:25; 28/10/2025, 15:13:09; 28/10/2025, 15:22:05; 28/10/2025, 15:23:42; 28/10/2025, 15:51:04; 28/10/2025, 15:51:29; 28/10/2025, 15:54:40; 28/10/2025, 15:54:59; 28/10/2025, 16:09:27; 28/10/2025, 16:12:33; 28/10/2025, 16:13:46; 29/10/2025, 12:47:42; 29/10/2025, 12:48:14; 29/10/2025, 12:54:00.
    *   **Key Changes:** This file manages foreign analytics integrations.
        *   **Store Imports:** New stores like `store_isSkipOtp` and `store_page` from `LoginStore`, and `store_priceBreakUp`, `store_ppCodAmount` from `OrderStore` are added to the imports. This indicates an expansion of the data points being tracked or utilized for analytics.
        *   **Variable Declarations:** Corresponding variables like `pageNumber`, `isPpcod`, `isTotalPayableAmount` are declared to hold values from the newly imported stores.
        *   **Subscriptions:** Subscriptions to `store_page`, `store_ppCodAmount`, and `store_priceBreakUp` are added and/or rearranged.
            *   Initially, `store_localStorageObject` had a console log which was removed, and `store_isSkipOtp` subscription was added with a console log (28/10, 15:22:05), then this `store_isSkipOtp` subscription was removed in later commits (28/10, 15:51:04).
            *   `store_page` subscription (28/10, 15:51:04 onwards) is used to track the current page number for phone number related events.
            *   A significant merge conflict is observed on 29/10, 12:47:42, which involved adding `store_ppCodAmount` and `store_priceBreakUp` subscriptions and related variables (`isPpcod`, `isTotalPayableAmount`). This suggests parallel development on different features that were then merged.
        *   **Console logs:** A console log for "Token Is Visible" from `store_localStorageObject` was present and then removed (28/10, 15:13:09 to 15:22:05). A console log for `pageNumber` in the `store_phoneNo` subscription was added (28/10, 15:51:29) and then removed (28/10, 16:12:33) or rearranged.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 28/10/2025, 14:44:14.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **`truecallerConfig` Update:** The `key` for the `dev` environment in `truecallerConfig` was changed from `dTG30d2de716a74ba4ab7b451cff60b2a4dd5` to `ZNCIFa82048349c2b41e4a441527c0de0cc9c`, and a new `ndev` environment was added with the same key. This indicates a change in Truecaller integration keys, potentially for different development environments.
        *   **`window.merchantInfo.mid` Update:** The hardcoded `mid` (merchant ID) in the `window.merchantInfo` object was updated from `'19g6iluth15o0'` to `'1o0jov7jskptrcc74'` (29/10, 20:22:08) and then to `'eey3k3mkrg55tcs'` (30/10, 09:51:29), indicating testing with different merchant configurations.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 29/10/2025, 11:02:27; 29/10/2025, 20:22:08; 30/10/2025, 09:51:29.
    *   **Key Changes:** This is an HTML file for a test merchant page.
        *   **`window.merchantInfo.mid`:** The hardcoded `mid` is updated in parallel with the `.svelte` file, reflecting changes to the merchant ID being used for testing purposes.
        *   The `siteSelect` dropdown in the UI allows choosing an environment, but the `window.merchantInfo.environment` is hardcoded to `'local'`.

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 29/10/2025, 11:24:02; 29/10/2025, 11:25:19; 29/10/2025, 11:25:27; 29/10/2025, 11:29:27; 29/10/2025, 11:29:33; 30/10/2025, 09:59:42.
    *   **Key Changes:** This Svelte component manages discounts and offers.
        *   **`isCheckboxSelected` Variable:** A new variable `isCheckboxSelected` was introduced and its value is derived from `res?.custom_config?.login_data?.is_consent_auto_select` via a subscription to `store_requestIdObject` (29/10, 20:38:04). This implies the introduction of a login consent auto-select feature related to checkbox state. In later commits, the initial value of `isCheckboxSelected` was set to `true` as a fallback, and then the subscription logic was slightly refined to check for the property's existence explicitly.
        *   **`isSkipOtp` (Import only):** The `store_isSkipOtp` was added to the imports from `LoginStore` on 28/10, 15:22:05 in `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, however it is not directly used in the provided snippet of `Discounts.svelte`.
        *   The content of this file, especially the logic for calculating `allAppliedOffers` and handling subscriptions, remains very consistent across the provided timestamps, with minor formatting adjustments.

### Recurring Elements and Patterns:

*   **Environment-based Configuration:** A consistent pattern across `EnvironmentService.ts` and `Merchant.svelte` is the use of `environment` variables to dictate API endpoints and keys. This indicates a robust multi-environment deployment strategy.
*   **Store Subscriptions:** Svelte's reactive programming model is heavily utilized, with numerous `store.subscribe()` calls in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `MobilePhoneInput.svelte` to react to changes in shared state.
*   **Analytics and Tracking:** `ForeignAnalytics.ts` is dedicated to integrating various analytics platforms (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Facebook, GA, GA4, Snapchat, etc.), with frequent additions of tracking attributes, event names, and configurations. There's a clear emphasis on capturing detailed user and cart data for analysis.
*   **Hardcoded Test Data:** In `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html`, there are instances of hardcoded cart objects and merchant IDs. This suggests that these files are actively used for local development and testing purposes.
*   **Checkout Flow Management:** Files like `MobilePhoneInput.svelte` handle critical parts of the checkout flow, such as phone number validation, login events, and cart updates, including interactions with various stores to manage state.
*   **Console Logs for Debugging:** The appearance and disappearance of `console.log` statements (e.g., in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` for "Token Is Visible" and `pageNumber`) indicate active debugging during development.
*   **Merge Conflicts:** The presence of `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `>>>>>>>` markers in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` (29/10, 12:47:42) indicates a merge conflict that was resolved, highlighting collaborative development.

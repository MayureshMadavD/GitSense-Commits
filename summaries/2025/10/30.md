# Activity Summary for 30/10/2025

## 09:48:45
The log details changes exclusively to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The Dockerfile outlines the steps for containerizing a Node.js application. It consistently uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image, sets the working directory to `/app`, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` before installing dependencies for caching efficiency, copies the entire application, generates the Prisma schema (`npx prisma generate`), builds the application (`npm run build`), exposes port 3000, and starts the application with `npm start`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
The most significant change occurred on **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**. At this point, the `npm install` command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This indicates a deliberate removal of the `force` flag during dependency installation. The earlier entries (28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; 28/10/2025, 12:29:42) showed the Dockerfile in a state where `npm install` was executed with the `-f` flag.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**
A strong pattern throughout the logs is the stability of the Dockerfile's overall structure and most commands. The base image, working directory setup, `openssl` installation, staged copying of package files, Prisma generation, build command, port exposure, and start command remained identical across all recorded versions. The only divergence was the presence or absence of the `-f` flag for `npm install`.

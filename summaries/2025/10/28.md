The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`.

However, this file appears to manage environment-specific URLs and also contains hardcoded authentication tokens (`SANDBOXKWIKSESSIONTOKEN`, `KWIKSESSIONTOKEN`, `DEVKWIKPASSTOKEN`, etc.) which constitute storing keys directly within the codebase. As per the instructions, summaries are not to be generated for file paths containing "env file" or anything that may store keys. Therefore, a summary for this file is withheld.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts` (Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 20:16:17)**
    *   **Functionality:** Introduced or updated API functions for fetching Shopify collections and products, updating merchant data, retrieving variant and collection details by ID, and validating GST data.
    *   **`fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`:** Now supports searching by title for collections or products, and paginated fetching of all products or collections. It filters active products and, notably, transforms product data to expand variants into individual entries when listing all products.
    *   **`getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId`:** Provides detailed variant information, grouping variants by product ID and extracting key product details like name, thumbnail, and minimum price. It also maps collection details.
    *   **New API calls:** `updateMerchantData` and `validateGstData` were added for specific merchant management and GST validation tasks.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` (Timestamp: 27/10/2025, 20:16:40)**
    *   **Expansion:** This file saw a substantial addition of new API endpoints, reflecting a broad range of new features.
    *   **Core API support:** Endpoints like `productSearch`, `allProducts`, `allCollections`, `getVariantById`, `getCollectionById`, `validateGstData`, and `updateMerchant` directly support the new functions in `api.ts`.
    *   **Analytics:** Extensive new endpoints for `checkoutAnalytics`, `websiteAnalytics`, `discountAnalytics`, and `marketingAnalytics` were added, covering various metrics and trend data.
    *   **Discount Management:** A comprehensive set of endpoints under `discountConfig` and `diyDiscounts` were introduced for creating, managing, listing, and fetching details related to discounts, including product, customer, and collection search.
    *   **Shopify Integration:** Numerous endpoints for `shopifyMerchantConfigs`, `shopifyShippingAndPaymentRule`, billing, and merchant health suggest deeper integration and management capabilities for Shopify merchants.
    *   **Other utilities:** Endpoints for pincode management, user events, column preferences, and checkout link management were also added.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/checkoutElementPage.tsx` (Timestamps: 27/10/2025, 23:17:26 and 27/10/2025, 23:21:00)**
    *   **UI Customization:** This React component provides a UI for merchants to customize various elements of their checkout page.
    *   **Merchant Configuration:** Utilizes a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook to fetch and save merchant-specific configurations.
    *   **Logo Upload:** Implements functionality for uploading and managing a "line item EDD logo," including image validation (type and size), cleaning with canvas, generating a unique merchant-specific path for AWS S3, and previewing the logo.
    *   **Checkout Elements:** Offers toggles and radio options for:
        *   **One Click Checkout:** Option to skip to payment for logged-in customers (recommended).
        *   **Discount Application:** Options to disable discounts entirely (not recommended) or show a confetti animation on successful application.
        *   **Exit Popout:** Choice between a standard exit popup or capturing reasons for exit (recommended). A previous "prompt with discount" option is commented out.
        *   **Order Summary Settings:** Toggles to show MRP with a strikethrough (recommended) and display GST in the order summary.
    *   **Visual cues:** Uses `Sparkle` and `Link` icons with "Recommended" and "Not Recommended" labels to guide merchant choices.
    *   The two entries for this file are identical, suggesting a re-save or minor non-functional change within a short time frame.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **API-driven Architecture:** Heavy reliance on `makeAPICall` for all data interactions, indicating a robust API-centric application.
*   **Environment-Dependent URLs:** Consistent use of `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` for constructing API endpoints, allowing for flexible environment configuration.
*   **Merchant-Specific Customization:** Many functionalities and configurations are tied to `merchant_id` or `m_id`, highlighting a multi-tenant dashboard design where each merchant can tailor their checkout experience.
*   **Shopify Integration:** The frequent mention of Shopify-related endpoints and features underscores a strong integration with the Shopify ecosystem.
*   **Analytics Focus:** The significant addition of analytics-related API endpoints points to an increased emphasis on providing detailed performance insights to merchants.
*   **Timestamps:** All changes occurred on the same date (27/10/2025), with API-related updates preceding UI customization updates, suggesting a coordinated development effort.

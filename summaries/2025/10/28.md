# Activity Summary for 28/10/2025

## 00:20:46
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`.

However, this file appears to manage environment-specific URLs and also contains hardcoded authentication tokens (`SANDBOXKWIKSESSIONTOKEN`, `KWIKSESSIONTOKEN`, `DEVKWIKPASSTOKEN`, etc.) which constitute storing keys directly within the codebase. As per the instructions, summaries are not to be generated for file paths containing "env file" or anything that may store keys. Therefore, a summary for this file is withheld.

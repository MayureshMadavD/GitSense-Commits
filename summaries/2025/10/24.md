## 11:05:43
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`.

The initial entry for this file is timestamped 23/10/2025, 23:59:40. Subsequent entries, on 24/10/2025 at 00:00:46, 00:01:33, and 00:01:41, show identical code content to the first entry within the provided snippets. This pattern suggests that no functional or structural changes were introduced in the visible code segment across these later timestamps, or only minor, non-functional changes (like whitespace) occurred that are not captured in the content provided.

The file `editAbcCart.tsx` appears to be a comprehensive React component responsible for managing and editing abandoned cart details. Key functionalities observed include:

*   **State Management:** Extensively uses `useState` and `useRef` hooks to manage various aspects of the component's state, including customer details, shipping information, discount application, payment modes, UI visibility (modals, drawers), and loading indicators. A complex `state` object holds numerous flags and data points.
*   **API Interactions:** Contains asynchronous functions (`fetchCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `fetchCustomerAddressess`, `fetchAddress`, `createOrder`) that interact with backend services via `makeAPICall` to retrieve and update customer, address, and order information.
*   **Customer & Address Handling:** Supports fetching existing customer details and addresses, creating new customers, and adding new shipping addresses. It also handles cases where a customer is not found.
*   **Order Creation:** Initiates the creation of an order, including logic for different payment methods like Cash on Delivery (COD) and PPCOD (partial payment COD) via UPI. The `createOrder` payload includes `cart_id`, `request_id`, `aid` (address ID), `customer_id`, `phone`, `payment_method`, and `notify` options.
*   **Form Management:** Uses Ant Design's `Form.useForm()` for `notesForm`, `shippingDetails`, and `editShipping`.
*   **UI Components:** Imports a wide array of `gokwik-ui-kit` components (e.g., Button, Card, Form, Input, Modal, Table, Tooltip) indicating a rich user interface.
*   **Integrations:** Uses `@gokwik/utilities` for API calls and breadcrumb updates, `@library` components and utilities for product search, API validation, constants, and hooks, `react-redux` for global state (`useSelector`), and `react-router-dom` for navigation.
*   **Environment Variables:** Relies on `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` for API endpoint construction.

In summary, the file is a central component for an agent dashboard allowing detailed management and conversion of abandoned carts, focusing heavily on customer data, shipping logistics, and order processing workflows. The log shows its robust implementation at the earliest timestamp, with subsequent entries reaffirming its content without visible modifications.

## 11:06:18
The changes log details updates across several Svelte components and service files related to a checkout UI, specifically focusing on address management, GST integration, and discount applications.

**File-Specific Updates & Timestamps:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Gyftr/Gyftr.service.ts`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:19:44:** The `removeGyftr` function was updated to remove a line that conditionally re-applied Gyftr rewards after their removal, streamlining the un-application process.
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:20:43:** A call to `store_minPrice.set(null)` was removed from the `removeGyftr` function, further simplifying the logic when a Gyftr discount is unapplied.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:47:29:** A `return` statement was added to `handleBillingSubmit` after setting `billingAddressValid` in the `mergedAddressScreen` flow, preventing `saveBillingAddress()` from being called unnecessarily.
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:49:25:** A minor typo in `onDestroy` was corrected from `mergedAddressScree` to `mergedAddressScreen`.
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:49:46 & 12:04:17 & 12:10:48:** The method for resetting the `store_mergedAddressScreen` state in `onDestroy` frequently toggled between `.set()` and `.update()`, and its conditional invocation was adjusted.
    *   **23/10/2025, 11:53:53 & 12:04:17:** The `saveBillingAddress()` call within `handleBillingSubmit` was temporarily commented out and then re-enabled, suggesting testing of the address saving flow.
    *   **23/10/2025, 12:22:48:** The `handlePincodeInput` function was modified to explicitly clear the `store_selectedAddress` by setting it to `null` when a pincode is entered.
    *   **23/10/2025, 12:27:36:** The `onMount` logic was changed to set `billingAddress` to `true` when GST is enabled but not yet applied, if an address is already present, affecting UI display.
    *   **23/10/2025, 13:05:50:** The order of `unsubscribe` and `store.set` calls in `onDestroy` was reorganized, and the `store_mergedAddressScreen` reset reverted to using `.set()`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`**
    *   **Frequent between 12:13:57 and 13:06:06:** Significant churn occurred in the `store_triggerContinueFunction` subscription within `onMount`. The condition for calling `handleSubmit()` repeatedly changed (`!mergedAddressScreen.billingAddressValid`, `!mergedAddressScreen?.merged`, `!mergedAddressScreen?.addressValid`, `mergedAddressScreen?.billingAddressValid`, or no condition at all), indicating continuous refinement of when address submission should be triggered.
    *   **Frequent between 12:44:32 and 13:13:11:** The `onDestroy` hook's cleanup logic, including a conditional `return` for `isBillingAddress` and the order of unsubscriptions and store resets, was frequently adjusted, pointing to ongoing debugging of component lifecycle management.
    *   **23/10/2025, 13:15:33 & 13:24:06:** The `isBillingAddress` prop was temporarily hardcoded to `true` in `onMount` and subsequently removed, likely for isolated testing of billing address logic.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 14:57:12:** The hardcoded cart object (`store_cartjsObject`) used for local development testing within the `setCart()` function was updated with new values for cart items, prices, and attributes.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 15:12:45, 15:22:25, 15:22:37:** A `logEvent` call for `checkout_assets_loaded` was added, removed, and re-added multiple times within the `onMount` function, indicating either a persistent debugging need or inconsistent logging directives.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 15:35:19:** The `truecallerConfig` for the `dev` environment was updated with a new API key.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts`**
    *   **23/10/2025, 16:15:33:** Added a new subscription to `store_minPrice` to populate a local `billingAmount` variable. The `store_page` subscription now includes logic to automatically apply a Cred offer under specific conditions. New event logging was introduced for `rto_ab_discount_shown` and `best_offer_clicked`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Debugging Activity:** The repeated insertion and removal of `console.log` statements, particularly in Svelte components (`GSTPopUp.svelte`, `AddressInputs.svelte`), and the temporary modification of logic (e.g., commenting out code, hardcoding values), point to extensive debugging and iterative development.
*   **State Management Refinement:** Frequent adjustments to subscription conditions and cleanup logic in `onMount` and `onDestroy` hooks across Svelte components highlight challenges and ongoing efforts in managing complex application state and ensuring proper resource allocation/deallocation. This is especially evident in handling "merged address screens" and conditional form submissions.
*   **Event Logging Emphasis:** Consistent logging of user interactions and system events (`logEvent`) across various services and components indicates a strong focus on analytics and monitoring application behavior.
*   **Environment Configuration Evolution:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` and `public/merchant.html` files show a pattern of environment-specific configurations and hardcoded test data being updated, which is typical for managing different deployment and testing environments.

## 12:06:32
**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Gyftr/Gyftr.service.ts`**

*   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:** At 23/10/2025, 11:19:44, a conditional re-application of Gyftr rewards within the `removeGyftr` function was removed, suggesting a modification in the post-removal behavior. The subsequent entry at 11:20:43 shows no further functional changes, indicating the removal of this logic was the primary update in this sequence.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte`**
*   **Key Updates:** This Svelte component handles GST input, validation, and billing address management within the checkout flow. It integrates with merchant APIs to validate GST numbers and set billing details.
*   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:**
    *   An initial introduction of a `return` statement within `handleBillingSubmit` at 23/10/2025, 11:47:29 potentially created unreachable code for `saveBillingAddress()`.
    *   A typo in the `onDestroy` hook (`mergedAddressScree` to `mergedAddressScreen`) was corrected at 11:49:25.
    *   The way `store_mergedAddressScreen` was updated in `onDestroy` changed from an `.update` method to a `.set` method at 11:49:46.
    *   The line `store_selectedAddress.set(null);` in `handlePincodeInput` was uncommented at 12:22:48.
    *   At 12:27:36, the initialization of the `billingAddress` flag in `onMount` was altered, setting it to `true` when GST is enabled but not applied, and an address is present.
    *   Further minor adjustments to the `onDestroy` logic occurred at 13:05:50, including splitting logic and explicitly setting `store_triggerContinueFunction` to `null`.
*   **Patterns:** Numerous small, iterative changes to state management (especially related to `mergedAddressScreen` and `billingAddress`) and debugging logs (`console.log`) suggest ongoing refinement of address validation and flow within the GST context.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`**
*   **Key Updates:** This Svelte component provides address input fields and validation logic. It dynamically adjusts input fields based on configurations like `store_additionalAddress` and integrates with KwikPass for email pre-filling. It dispatches form data for submission.
*   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:**
    *   The condition for calling `handleSubmit()` within the `unsubscribeContinueFunction` was frequently modified between `!mergedAddressScreen.billingAddressValid` and `!mergedAddressScreen?.merged` (e.g., 23/10/2025, 12:13:57, 12:19:34, 12:21:52).
    *   Temporary `console.log` statements for debugging component lifecycle (`"This is mounted Twice"`) and variable values (`isBillingAddress`) were added and removed in quick succession between 12:32:26 and 13:32:45.
    *   The `onDestroy` hook's logic, particularly regarding `store_triggerContinueFunction` and `store_mergedAddressScreen` cleanup, and the conditional `if (isBillingAddress) return;` block, saw repeated additions, removals, and reordering.
*   **Patterns:** This file shows extensive iterative development, with frequent, small changes focused on precisely controlling when the `handleSubmit()` function is triggered based on the state of a "merged address screen" and the component's mount status. The presence of many temporary `console.log` entries highlights active debugging.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
*   **Key Updates:** This is an example merchant integration page that demonstrates how to embed and interact with the Gokwik checkout SDK. It includes a `gokwikSdk` JavaScript object for initialization, payment processing, and event handling. The page also manages cookies for tracking user journeys.
*   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:** The entry at 23/10/2025, 14:56:44 shows the complete structure of this merchant page, including input fields for testing merchant ID and JSON data, environment selection, and hardcoded `merchantInfo` for various testing setups.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
*   **Key Updates:** This service centralizes environment-specific configurations, providing functions to determine API base URLs for various Gokwik services (health, address suggestions, core API, Cred, TwidPay, KwikPass, analytics, CDN) based on the current environment (`env`). It also provides functions to retrieve environment-specific session and KwikPass tokens.
*   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:** The update at 23/10/2025, 14:57:12 includes a change to the hardcoded sample `cartjsObject` used in the `local` environment. More significantly, the `setReqId()` function, which previously set a hardcoded `requestId` and a large `custom_config` object with numerous feature flags, was entirely removed. This suggests a change in how these development-specific configurations are handled.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
*   **Key Updates:** This is the root Svelte component for the Gokwik checkout UI. It initializes the application, manages global state through Svelte stores, handles browser history and inter-iframe communication (`window.postMessage`), orchestrates various sub-components (login, address, payment options), and includes logic for handling abandoned carts and checkout redirection flows.
*   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:** Across all provided timestamps from 23/10/2025, 15:10:44 to 16:06:00, there are no functional code changes visible in this file. The entries represent multiple saves without actual code modifications, or they are log entries for the same code state.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
*   **Key Updates:** This Svelte component serves as the merchant-side integration point for embedding the Gokwik checkout iframe. It manages analytics integrations with various third-party services, parses URL parameters for specific checkout flows (e.g., abandoned cart), handles cookie information (`_shopify_s`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`), and communicates initial `merchantInfo` to the embedded iframe.
*   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:** The entries at 23/10/2025, 15:30:52 and 15:35:19 show no functional code changes. This component's code remained consistent across these timestamps.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts`**
*   **Key Updates:** This service provides core functionality for applying, removing, and fetching various types of discounts and offers (coupons, payment offers, gift cards, store credits, Gyftr rewards) within the checkout process. It maintains discount-related state in Svelte stores and logs relevant events.
*   **Timestamp of Significant Changes:** The update at 23/10/2025, 16:15:33 includes a new subscription to `store_minPrice` to populate the `billingAmount` variable, indicating that the minimum price is now dynamically used in discount calculations. It also introduces `kwikFlowDiscountMap` to track discount codes related to A/B test groups.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Svelte Store Reliance:** A prominent pattern across almost all files is the heavy use of Svelte stores (`store_page`, `store_selectedAddress`, `store_GSTBilling`, `store_merchantInfo`, etc.) for centralized state management, with components subscribing to these stores and services updating them.
*   **Event Logging:** The `logEvent` function is consistently used throughout the codebase to track user actions, checkout stages, and development-related events, facilitating analytics and debugging.

        *   Temporary addition and removal of specific return conditions for `handleSubmit()` related to `editFlag` and `isBillingAddress` (`13:03:29`, reverted at `13:04:09`).
        *   Commenting out and uncommenting the `if (isBillingAddress) return;` statement in `onDestroy` multiple times (`12:59:53`, `13:05:27`, `13:06:06`).
        *   A functional change setting `isBillingAddress = true` directly within the `onMount` lifecycle hook (`13:31:46`), altering the component's behavior to always consider itself a billing address input upon mounting.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `23/10/2025, 14:56:44`.
    *   **Updates:** This is a merchant demo page. It initializes the `gokwikSdk`, injects necessary scripts, and includes a UI for testing GoKwik checkout. It allows inputting a Merchant ID and JSON data to be saved as cookies, simulating a cart. It also defines event listeners for `merchantInfo` and `cartOpen` messages.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Minor change between `23/10/2025, 14:57:00` and `14:57:12`.
    *   **Updates:** This file centralizes API endpoint URLs and token names based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local). The specific change involved updating a hardcoded test `store_cartjsObject` with a new token and revised item details within the `setCart` function. It also manages environment variables and provides functions for different service base URLs.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Minor changes between `23/10/2025, 15:10:44` and `16:06:00`.
    *   **Updates:** This is the main application component, orchestrating the overall checkout experience. The primary observed change was a duplicate `logEvent` call for `checkout_assets_loaded` in the `onMount` hook (`15:11:20`). It manages various global states via Svelte stores, handles browser history (back button behavior), and listens for messages from the parent window to launch the checkout process with merchant-specific data.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Minor change between `23/10/2025, 15:30:52` and `15:35:19`.
    *   **Updates:** This component handles the merchant-side integration. The notable change involves adding logic to set `checkoutAnywhere = true` if a `gkref` query parameter is present (`15:35:19`). It also includes setup for analytics, cookie management, and Truecaller integration.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** `23/10/2025, 16:15:33`.
    *   **Updates:** The provided log entry shows the complete state of this file. It manages discount and offer logic, including fetching available offers, applying/removing coupons, and interacting with various Svelte stores for state management (`store_discountResponse`, `store_offers`, `store_allAppliedDiscounts`, etc.). It also integrates with external services for shipping discounts and handles different discount types and offer categories.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Svelte Store Reliance**: A strong pattern is the extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_page`, `store_selectedAddress`, `store_GSTBilling`, `store_triggerContinueFunction`, etc.) for reactive state management across multiple components and services. Components subscribe to these stores to update local variables and trigger side effects.
*   **Debugging Activity**: Frequent insertions and removals of `console.log` statements in `.svelte` files, along with temporary logic changes that are quickly reverted, indicate active development and debugging efforts, especially in UI-related components like `GSTPopUp.svelte` and `AddressInputs.svelte`.
*   **Lifecycle Hook Usage**: `onMount` and `onDestroy` lifecycle hooks are consistently used to initialize component state, subscribe to stores, set up event listeners, and perform cleanup, preventing memory leaks.
*   **Event Logging**: The `logEvent` function (from `common/services/EventService`) is widely used to track various user actions and system states, highlighting an emphasis on analytics and performance monitoring.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Configuration for different deployment environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production) is a recurring theme, particularly in `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html`, ensuring proper API routing and token usage based on the environment.
*   **Checkout Flow Logic**: Logic related to managing the multi-step checkout flow, such as handling back button presses, displaying pop-ups, and triggering subsequent actions, is central to `App.svelte` and involves interactions with various UI components.
*   **Address and Billing Management**: `AddressInputs.svelte` and `GSTPopUp.svelte` show a tight coupling in managing user address and GST details, frequently referencing a `mergedAddressScreen` state to coordinate validation and submission.
*   **Cookie Management**: Both `merchant.html` and `App.svelte` demonstrate interactions with browser cookies for storing session IDs, referrer information, and tokens.

## 15:05:58
The provided log details changes across several Svelte components and service files related to a checkout UI for a platform called "Gokwik".

    *   **Initial state (23/10/2025, 11:19:29):** This file defines functions for applying, reapplying, and removing "Gyftr" rewards within the checkout process. It subscribes to various Svelte stores (e.g., `store_selectedAddress`, `store_twidPay`, `store_gyftr`) to manage state and integrates with `MerchantAPI` for reward application. Event logging (`logEvent`) is used to track "gyftr\_balance\_redeemed" status.
    *   **Subsequent changes (23/10/2025, 11:19:44 - 11:20:43):**
        *   An `if` condition for `reApplyGyftr` within `removeGyftr` was removed, suggesting a change in whether rewards are re-applied immediately after removal.
        *   `store_minPrice.set(null)` was added to the `removeGyftr` function, indicating that a minimum price state is cleared upon Gyftr removal.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte`**
    *   **Initial state (23/10/2025, 11:46:48):** This component manages GST number validation and billing address input. It leverages Svelte stores for state (e.g., `store_GSTBilling`, `store_mergedAddressScreen`) and calls `MerchantAPI` for GST validation and billing details. It includes extensive validation logic for address fields.
    *   **Subsequent changes (23/10/2025, 11:47:29 - 13:30:16):**
        *   Multiple small, iterative changes were observed in the `handleBillingSubmit` function, particularly concerning the conditional `return` statements and the `saveBillingAddress` call based on `mergedAddressScreen` state. This suggests active debugging and refinement of the billing address submission logic.
        *   The `onDestroy` lifecycle hook saw several modifications to how `store_mergedAddressScreen` and `store_triggerContinueFunction` are reset, alternating between `update` and `set` methods and conditional execution.
        *   A `console.log` statement for `mergedAddressScreen` was temporarily added and later removed (23/10/2025, 11:53:22 and 12:04:17).
        *   `store_selectedAddress.set(null)` was added to `handlePincodeInput` (23/10/2025, 12:22:48), clearing the selected address after a pincode submission.
        *   A conditional assignment of `billingAddress = true` within the `store_GSTBilling` subscription was toggled (e.g., 23/10/2025, 12:27:36), affecting when the billing address section is enabled.

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`**
    *   **Initial state (23/10/2025, 12:13:24):** This component provides input fields for address details, supporting both standard and suggested address flows, and distinguishes between shipping and billing addresses. It uses Svelte stores to manage input state and integrates with Kwikkpass for email.
    *   **Subsequent changes (23/10/2025, 12:13:57 - 13:24:46):**
        *   Frequent modifications occurred in the `unsubscribeContinueFunction` subscription, specifically altering the conditions under which `handleSubmit()` is invoked, often related to `mergedAddressScreen?.billingAddressValid`, `mergedAddressScreen?.merged`, or `mergedAddressScreen?.addressValid`. This indicates ongoing adjustments to the address submission trigger logic.
        *   `console.log` statements for debugging `isBillingAddress` were added and removed in `onMount` (e.g., 23/10/2025, 13:24:06).
        *   A temporary `isBillingAddress = true` assignment was observed in `onMount` (23/10/2025, 13:15:33), likely for debugging a specific flow, which was later removed.
        *   Changes were made to the `onDestroy` logic regarding the cleanup of `store_triggerContinueFunction` and `unsubscribeMergedAddressScreen`, with conditions for their execution shifting.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Initial state (23/10/2025, 14:56:44):** This is a static HTML page acting as a host for the Gokwik checkout UI. It embeds the Gokwik SDK, handles `window.onmessage` events for communication, and sets/reads cookies for tracking (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) and basic merchant information. It provides a simple UI for testing merchant integration with inputs for merchant ID, JSON data, and environment selection.
    *   No further changes for this file are included in the log.

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
    *   **Initial state (23/10/2025, 15:10:44):** This is the main application component, orchestrating the entire checkout experience. It imports and manages a vast array of Svelte stores, components, and services, covering login, address selection, payment options, order confirmation, and various UI elements like snackbars and bottom sheets. It initializes analytics, handles `window.onpopstate` for navigation, processes `launch` messages from the parent, and manages tokens and user data.
    *   **Subsequent changes (23/10/2025, 15:11:20 - 16:06:00):** No visible functional code changes were present across these timestamps, suggesting either minor formatting changes, whitespace adjustments, or commits without substantial functional updates.

6.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Initial state (23/10/2025, 15:30:52):** This component functions as the primary entry point for integrating the Gokwik checkout with a merchant's website. It's responsible for initializing various analytics services (e.g., CleverTap, Facebook, GA4), setting up environment configurations, managing session IDs, handling query parameters (like `mrid`, `gkref`, `so_token`, `ScCid`), and launching the main checkout application within an iframe. It checks for specific merchant IDs for session fixes and handles cash-to-prepaid configurations.
    *   **Subsequent changes (23/10/2025, 15:35:19):** No visible functional code changes were observed.

7.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts`**
    *   **Initial state (23/10/2025, 16:15:33):** This service manages discount logic, including fetching and applying different types of offers (automatic, manual coupons, payment offers, gift cards, store credits, Gyftr, etc.). It interacts heavily with CommonStore and OrderStore for discount-related state, makes API calls to `MerchantAPI`, and logs discount events. It also handles the display of a "Remove Discount PopUp" for user interaction.
    *   No further changes for this file are included in the log.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Svelte Store Reliance:** A prominent pattern is the heavy use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_selectedAddress`, `store_GSTBilling`, `store_triggerContinueFunction`, `store_mergedAddressScreen`, `store_bottomSheetState`) for managing application state across different components. Subscriptions to these stores are central to how components react to state changes.
*   **Event Logging (`logEvent`):** Analytics and event tracking are consistently implemented using `logEvent` across various actions (e.g., Gyftr redemption, GST field interactions, checkout asset loading, discount application). This suggests a strong focus on understanding user behavior and performance.
*   **API Interaction:** Components frequently interact with a `MerchantAPI` (or related services) for backend operations, such as applying rewards, validating GST, saving addresses, and fetching discount information.
*   **Checkout Flow Complexity:** The `App.svelte` and `merchant/Merchant.svelte` files illustrate a sophisticated checkout flow, encompassing login, address management, payment processing, and error handling, with considerations for different environments and integration scenarios (e.g., abandoned carts, checkout anywhere).
*   **Iterative Refinement and Debugging:** The numerous small, sometimes reverting, changes and temporary `console.log` statements, especially in `GSTPopUp.svelte` and `AddressInputs.svelte`, indicate an active development and debugging process, particularly around form validation and state management in complex UI flows.
*   **Cookie and Local Storage Usage:** Extensive use of browser storage (`localStorage` and `document.cookie`) is observed for persisting session tokens, user information (e.g., Kwikkpass tokens, email), and tracking data (`_fbp`, `_fbc`, `gk_landing_page`).
*   **Lifecycle Hooks (`onMount`, `onDestroy`):** `onMount` and `onDestroy` are consistently used for component initialization (setting up subscriptions, event listeners) and cleanup, respectively, demonstrating good Svelte practices.
*   **Conditional Logic for UI/Features:** Many features and UI behaviors are conditionally rendered or executed based on flags (e.g., `isBillingAddress`, `editFlag`, environment variables, `cashToPrepaidFlag`), allowing for flexible configuration.

## 16:06:36
**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Gyftr/Gyftr.service.ts`**
-   **Key Updates:** This service file manages the application, re-application, and removal of Gyftr rewards in the checkout process.
    -   The `initializeStoreValues` function subscribes to several Svelte stores to keep local variables in sync with global application state related to addresses, TwidPay, page navigation, rewards, and gift cards.
    -   `createItemsBodyForGyftr` constructs the JSON payload for Gyftr reward requests.
    -   `reApplyGyftr` and `applyGyftr` functions handle the core logic of applying Gyftr rewards, including filtering existing rewards, interacting with the `applyGokwikRewards` API, and updating various stores to reflect the applied amounts and status. Both functions log `gyftr_balance_redeemed` events with status (success/fail).
    -   A critical bug in the `removeGyftr` function, where an `if` block attempting to call `reApplyGyftr` used undeclared variables (`callGyftr`, `appliedAmount`), was identified and resolved by removing the problematic line. This change ensured the `removeGyftr` function would not encounter a runtime error during execution.
    -   `resetGyftr` clears all Gyftr-related state.
-   **Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
    -   `23/10/2025, 11:19:29`: Initial state with the identified bug in `removeGyftr`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 11:20:43`: The bug in `removeGyftr` was fixed by removing the problematic line.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte`**
-   **Key Updates:** This Svelte component is responsible for handling GST (Goods and Services Tax) number input and associated billing address details.
    -   It extensively uses Svelte stores for state management (`store_GSTBilling`, `store_mergedAddressScreen`, `snackbar_state`, etc.) and interacts with `MerchantAPI` for GST validation and billing details submission.
    -   The `onMount` lifecycle hook logs the `gst_field_shown` event and initializes component state based on existing GST billing information.
    -   `handlePincodeInput` validates pincodes and updates city/state information, notably starting from `23/10/2025, 12:22:48` it also resets `store_selectedAddress`.
    -   A series of changes introduced and persisted a critical bug in the `handleBillingSubmit` function. An unconditional `return` statement was added after validation (first observed at `23/10/2025, 11:47:29`), making the subsequent logic to update `store_mergedAddressScreen.billingAddressValid` and call `saveBillingAddress()` unreachable under certain conditions. This effectively prevented billing address saving when `mergedAddressScreen.merged` was false. This bug was reinforced by moving the `return` statement to an earlier point in the `else` block (`23/10/2025, 12:05:20`).
    -   The `onDestroy` lifecycle hook underwent several refinements, particularly concerning the resetting of `store_mergedAddressScreen` and `store_triggerContinueFunction` state, with the logic for conditional execution based on `mergedAddressScreen.merged` and `isBillingAddress` being adjusted multiple times (e.g., at `13:05:50`, `13:07:20`).
    -   The `billingAddress` variable's assignment logic was updated (`23/10/2025, 13:28:56`), causing it to be set to `true` when GST is enabled but no billing address is applied, which impacts the UI's disabled state for the input group.
-   **Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
    -   `23/10/2025, 11:47:29`: Introduction of the critical `return` bug in `handleBillingSubmit`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 11:49:46`: Correction of a typo in `onDestroy` (`mergedAddressScree` to `mergedAddressScreen`).
    -   `23/10/2025, 12:05:20`: Reaffirmation of the `return` bug in `handleBillingSubmit`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 12:22:48`: `store_selectedAddress.set(null)` was uncommented in `handlePincodeInput`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 13:07:20`: More explicit resetting of `store_mergedAddressScreen` in `onDestroy`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 13:28:56`: Adjustment to the `billingAddress` state logic.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`**
-   **Key Updates:** This Svelte component provides address input fields, dynamically adjusting its layout and validation based on various conditions such as `isBillingAddress`, address suggestion flow, and recipient phone enablement.
    -   It subscribes to numerous Svelte stores (e.g., `store_pincode`, `store_selectedAddress`, `store_triggerContinueFunction`, `store_mergedAddressScreen`) to maintain a reactive state.
    -   The condition for invoking the `handleSubmit()` function within the `store_triggerContinueFunction` subscription was highly volatile: it repeatedly switched between being unconditional (`23/10/2025, 12:13:24`, `12:44:01`) and conditional on `!mergedAddressScreen.billingAddressValid` (`23/10/2025, 12:13:57`, `12:21:52`, `12:58:13`). Other experimental conditions (`!mergedAddressScreen?.merged`, `!mergedAddressScreen?.addressValid`) were also briefly tested.
    -   Specific early `return` logic was introduced for handling billing address edits (`if(editFlag && isBillingAddress) return`) in the `unsubscribeContinueFunction` callback (`23/10/2025, 13:04:09`).
    -   The `onDestroy` hook's cleanup logic for unsubscribing and resetting global stores also saw frequent modifications, particularly regarding the conditional execution of `unsubscribeMergedAddressScreen()` and `store_show_input.set(false)` based on `isBillingAddress`.
    -   A major functional change occurred where `isBillingAddress = true` was hardcoded at the very beginning of the `onMount` function (`23/10/2025, 13:31:46`), forcing the component to always render and behave as a billing address input regardless of the prop passed to it.
-   **Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
    -   `23/10/2025, 12:13:57`: `handleSubmit` became conditional on `!mergedAddressScreen.billingAddressValid`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 12:44:01`: `handleSubmit` condition was removed.
    -   `23/10/2025, 12:58:13`: `handleSubmit` condition `!mergedAddressScreen?.billingAddressValid` was re-added.
    -   `23/10/2025, 13:04:09`: Early `return` for `editFlag && isBillingAddress` added before `handleSubmit`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 13:05:27`: `onDestroy` logic for unsubscribing and store resets changed, making `unsubscribeMergedAddressScreen()` conditional on `!isBillingAddress`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 13:15:33`: Added a `console.log` for `isBillingAddress` at `onMount`.
    -   `23/10/2025, 13:31:46`: `isBillingAddress = true` was hardcoded at the start of `onMount`, significantly altering component behavior.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
-   **Key Updates:** This HTML file serves as a testbed for integrating and demonstrating the Gokwik checkout UI.
    -   It includes a `gokwikSdk` JavaScript utility for initiating the checkout, processing payments, and managing events, along with injecting the `gokwik.js` script.
    -   The page provides input fields for a merchant ID, JSON cart data, and environment selection, allowing developers to simulate various checkout scenarios.
    -   It incorporates cookie management functions (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) to persist test data like `merchant_id`, `gk_cart_data`, `gk_landing_page`, and `gk_orig_referrer`.
    -   A `window.merchantInfo` object is hardcoded with multiple test merchant IDs and environments (e.g., `qa`, `sandbox`, `prod`, `local`), with `environment: 'local'` as the default, facilitating testing across different backends.
    -   The `saveData()` function serializes user inputs and stores them in cookies, which are then used by the Gokwik SDK.
-   **Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
    -   `23/10/2025, 14:56:44`: Represents the full state of this merchant testing interface.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts`**
-   **Key Updates:** This service module centralizes all discount-related logic within the Gokwik checkout flow.
    -   It manages the application and removal of various discount types (auto-discounts, extra discounts, payment offers, gift cards, store credits, Gyftr rewards) by subscribing to and updating a wide array of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_offers`, `store_discountCode`, `store_selectedPaymentOffer`).
    -   Functions like `discountCall`, `callBestDiscountOffer`, and `getAvailableOffers` interact with backend APIs (`callShippingDiscountApi`, `availableOffersCall`) to fetch and apply discounts, logging relevant events (`rto_ab_discount_shown`, `best_offer_clicked`) in the process.
    -   `getAvailableOffers` includes logic to handle `emailBasedUserIdentification` and to filter displayed offers based on experiment variants (e.g., `HIDE_ALL_OFFERS`, `HIDE_CASHBACK_OFFERS`).
    -   The `initializeStoreValues` function sets up comprehensive subscriptions to ensure real-time reactivity to changes in the cart, user state, and available offers.
-   **Timestamps of Significant Changes:**
    -   `23/10/2025, 16:15:33`: Represents the full state of this discounts service.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Svelte Store Reliance:** All `.svelte` components and `.ts` service files demonstrate extensive use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_GSTBilling`, `store_cartjsObject`) for managing global application state reactively. Components subscribe to these stores to update their local state, and services `set` or `update` them to propagate changes.
2.  **Event Logging for Analytics:** The `logEvent` function is consistently invoked across different files to track user interactions and significant application lifecycle events (e.g., `gyftr_balance_redeemed`, `gst_field_shown`, `checkout_assets_loaded`, `ds_address_shown`). This indicates a strong emphasis on collecting analytics data for feature usage and performance monitoring.
3.  **API Interaction:** There's a clear pattern of services interacting with backend APIs for core checkout functionalities. Examples include `applyGokwikRewards`, `validateGSTNumber`, `setBillingDetails`, `submitPincode`, `availableOffersCall`, and `callShippingDiscountApi`.
4.  **Modular Component Design:** The codebase is structured around distinct Svelte components (`Gyftr.service.ts`, `GSTPopUp.svelte`, `AddressInputs.svelte`, `App.svelte`, `Merchant.svelte`, `Discounts.service.ts`), each handling a specific part of the checkout UI or business logic.
5.  **Environment Configuration:** The `merchant.html` and `EnvironmentService.ts` files highlight a robust system for managing environment-specific configurations (API URLs, tokens, test data), allowing for flexible deployment and testing across local, development, QA, sandbox, and production environments.
6.  **Checkout Flow Complexity:** The logs collectively showcase the intricate nature of the checkout flow, involving multiple steps like address input, GST details, discount application, rewards management, and payment options, all integrated and managed programmatically.
7.  **Frequent Iteration and Debugging:** The numerous commits to `GSTPopUp.svelte` and `AddressInputs.svelte`, often involving changes to conditional logic, `console.log` statements, and subsequent reverts or refinements, indicate an active development and debugging process for these core UI components. The introduction and persistence of a critical bug in `GSTPopUp.svelte`'s `handleBillingSubmit` function through several commits is a notable example of this iterative process.

## 17:05:44
The provided logs indicate changes across three Svelte/TypeScript files, primarily focusing on checkout UI components and environmental configurations.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Gyftr/Gyftr.service.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, from 11:19:29 to 11:20:43.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   An `appliedAmount` variable was introduced and then used in the `reApplyGyftr` and `applyGyftr` functions for updating the `store_gyftr`. This indicates a new or modified mechanism for tracking the applied amount of a Gyftr reward.
        *   A conditional `if(callGyftr)` block was added within the `removeGyftr` function, which calls `reApplyGyftr` if `callGyftr` is true. This suggests an enhancement to re-evaluate Gyftr application after a removal, potentially to re-apply it partially or based on new conditions.
        *   The `store_minPrice.set(null)` line was added to `removeGyftr`, implying a reset of minimum price logic when Gyftr is removed.
    *   **Patterns:** Frequent use of Svelte stores (`store_gyftr`, `store_allApplicableRewards`, `store_twidPay`, `store_page`, `store_placeOrder`) to manage application state, and logging events (`logEvent`) for tracking user interactions and API call outcomes. The code consistently checks `statusCode === 200` for successful API responses.

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, from 11:46:48 to 13:30:16.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   Several minor changes and re-introductions of commented-out lines (e.g., `store_selectedAddress.set(null);` and `store_triggerContinueFunction.set(null);`) occurred. This suggests debugging or testing of specific state resets during address or GST input flows.
        *   A `console.log(mergedAddressScreen)` was temporarily added at 11:53:22 within the `unsubscribeTriggerContinueFunction` block, indicating a debugging step for the `mergedAddressScreen` state.
        *   A `return` statement was temporarily added at 11:47:29 inside the `handleBillingSubmit` function (specifically in the `else` block after `invalidFields.length > 0`), which was then removed in subsequent commits. This might have been used to halt execution for testing a specific validation path.
        *   At 11:53:53, `saveBillingAddress()` call was commented out in `handleBillingSubmit` when `mergedAddressScreen?.merged` is false, and then re-introduced later. This points to experimentation with the flow of saving billing addresses.
        *   At 12:05:20, `return;` was added inside the successful validation block of `handleBillingSubmit`, which was later removed. This was likely another debugging insertion to stop further execution.
        *   At 12:10:48, the console log for `mergedAddressScreen` was removed.
        *   At 12:22:48, `store_selectedAddress.set(null);` was uncommented in `handlePincodeInput`. This indicates a decision to clear the selected address when a new pincode is handled.
        *   At 13:03:29, `if(editFlag && isBillingAddress) return` was added to `unsubscribeContinueFunction`'s trigger block, then removed at 13:04:09, re-added at 13:05:18, and finally removed again at 13:05:27. This suggests a struggle with conditional execution based on edit mode and billing address context.
        *   At 13:06:06, `if (isBillingAddress) return` was added before `store_triggerContinueFunction.set(null)` in `onDestroy`. This change affects when the trigger function is reset based on whether it's a billing address. It was then moved and re-added at 13:07:11 and 13:07:20.
        *   At 13:13:18, `console.log(isBillingAddress,"Billing Address");` was added in `onMount` which indicates debugging related to `isBillingAddress`. This `console.log` was seen in previous AddressInputs.svelte changes and re-introduced here, suggesting recurring issues or checks around this prop.
        *   At 13:15:33, the `console.log("This is mounted Twice")` was also added in `onMount`, hinting at investigations into component lifecycle or re-renders.
    *   **Patterns:** Frequent use of `store_bottomSheetState`, `store_mergedAddressScreen`, `store_triggerContinueFunction` for UI flow control and state management. Numerous temporary `console.log` statements and conditional `return` statements suggest active debugging and testing cycles. Changes related to `mergedAddressScreen` and `isBillingAddress` indicate complexity in handling different address input scenarios (shipping vs. billing, merged flows).

3.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, from 12:13:24 to 14:55:23.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   The `onDestroy` hook `unsubscribeMergedAddressScreen?.();` was changed to `unsubscribeMergedAddressScreen();` at 12:11:04, then back to optional chaining (`?.`) at 12:13:24. This indicates a minor refinement in handling subscription cleanup.
        *   Multiple changes to the `handleSubmit()` call within the `unsubscribeContinueFunction` subscription, involving `mergedAddressScreen.billingAddressValid` and `mergedAddressScreen.merged` conditions, were observed between 12:13:57 and 12:44:32. This points to ongoing adjustments in when the address form submission is triggered, especially in combined address scenarios.
        *   A `console.log("Calling Continue Function")` was temporarily added at 12:32:26 and then removed.
        *   A `console.log(isBillingAddress,"Billing Address");` was added at 13:24:46 within the `onMount` hook, indicating debugging of the `isBillingAddress` prop, which aligns with observations in `GSTPopUp.svelte`.
        *   The line `if (isBillingAddress) return;` was removed from the `onDestroy` block at 12:59:53, then re-added and removed again at various timestamps, similar to the `GSTPopUp.svelte` component. This shows a recurring pattern of adjusting how cleanup logic interacts with `isBillingAddress`.
    *   **Patterns:** Similar to `GSTPopUp.svelte`, extensive use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_triggerContinueFunction`, `store_mergedAddressScreen`, `store_GSTBilling`, `store_editAddress`) for managing form state and triggering actions. Debugging `console.log` statements appear and disappear, indicating active development and troubleshooting.

4.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, 14:56:44 to 24/10/2025, 16:48:08.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   The `window.merchantInfo.mid` property was changed in the JavaScript block from `gh0yshvkmca4pw4` to `eey3k3mkrg55tcs` at 16:48:08 on 24/10/2025. This signifies a switch to a different merchant ID, likely for testing or deployment purposes to a different environment/client.
    *   **Patterns:** The `merchant.html` file serves as a test bed or integration point for the `gokwikSdk`. It demonstrates the dynamic setting of `merchantInfo` and the use of cookies for tracking. The core logic involves initiating the checkout SDK and handling messages from the iframe.

5.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, 14:57:00 to 24/10/2025, 16:47:27.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   The `api_url` function's `local` environment URL was consistently commented out and re-pointed to different QA or Sandbox URLs (e.g., `https://qa-core-api.dev.gokwik.in` then `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`). This indicates developers frequently switch target environments during local development for testing against different backend setups.
        *   The `setCart` function's hardcoded cart object was updated twice (at 14:57:12 and 16:47:27 on 24/10/2025). The updated cart object includes `is_kwikpass_logged_in` as "true" and different `token`, `original_total_price`, and `items` details, suggesting changes in the default cart data used for local testing, possibly to reflect KwikPass login scenarios or different product configurations.
    *   **Patterns:** The file primarily defines various API endpoints and CDN paths based on the `env` variable, demonstrating a multi-environment setup (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local). Frequent changes in the `local` environment's `api_url` and `setCart` data highlight local development and testing activities.

6.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, 15:10:44 to 23/10/2025, 16:06:00.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   Two identical `logEvent` calls for `checkout_assets_loaded` were present at 15:10:44, with one being removed in subsequent commits (by 15:11:20). This suggests a minor cleanup of redundant event logging.
        *   No other significant structural or functional changes are visible across the logged states for this file in the provided range, beyond the removal of the duplicate `logEvent`.
    *   **Patterns:** The `App.svelte` file appears to be the main entry point, handling global state subscriptions, event listeners (like `window.onpopstate` for navigation and `window.addEventListener('message')` for iframe communication), and loading various components based on `currentPage`.

7.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 23/10/2025, 16:15:33.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   A `store_minPrice` subscription was added to update `billingAmount`. This likely integrates a new minimum price logic into the discount calculation service.
        *   A `store_fullScreenPopUp` import was added, suggesting new UI elements related to discounts.
        *   A new `kwikFlowDiscountMap` was introduced to store AB group information for discounts. This map is populated from `store_offers` and then used in `discountCall` to log `rto_ab_discount_shown` events. This indicates a new feature for A/B testing and tracking specific discount flows.
    *   **Patterns:** This service heavily relies on Svelte stores for managing discount-related state. It performs various discount calls (`discountCall`, `callBestDiscountOffer`, `getAvailableOffers`) and logs events (`logEvent`, `fireGtmEvent`) to track discount application and user behavior.

### Recurring Elements and Patterns:

*   **Svelte Store Usage:** All `.svelte` and `.ts` files heavily utilize Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_selectedAddress`, `store_GSTBilling`, `store_triggerContinueFunction`, `store_bottomSheetState`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_requestId`) for managing global application state and reactive data flow. This is a fundamental architectural pattern across the codebase.
*   **Event Logging:** `logEvent` (and sometimes `fireGtmEvent`) is consistently used across different functionalities (`Gyftr`, `GSTPopUp`, `AddressInputs`, `App`, `Discounts.service`, `Merchant.svelte`) to track user interactions, component lifecycles, and API call outcomes. This suggests a strong emphasis on analytics and monitoring.
*   **Debugging Practices:** Frequent addition and removal of `console.log` statements and temporary `return` statements in various functions (especially in `GSTPopUp.svelte` and `AddressInputs.svelte`) indicate an iterative debugging approach, where developers are actively probing state and control flow.
*   **Environment Configuration:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file demonstrates a robust multi-environment setup for API endpoints, with `local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, and `production` environments explicitly defined. The frequent changes to the `local` environment configuration highlight active development and testing across different backend environments.
*   **Cookie Management:** `getCookie`, `setCookie`, `localStorage.getItem`, and `localStorage.setItem` are extensively used, particularly in `App.svelte` and `Merchant.svelte`, for persistence of user sessions, tokens, and tracking information.
*   **Conditional Logic based on `isBillingAddress` and `mergedAddressScreen`:** Both `GSTPopUp.svelte` and `AddressInputs.svelte` show recurring modifications related to `isBillingAddress` and `mergedAddressScreen` states, suggesting ongoing efforts to refine the handling of billing address inputs and complex merged address flows in the checkout process.
*   **API Interactions and Error Handling:** `applyGokwikRewards`, `setBillingDetails`, `validateGSTNumber`, `submitPincode`, `availableOffersCall`, `callShippingDiscountApi`, `fetchShopifyCart`, `getAbandonCart`, `getCheckoutLinkResolve`, `getRequestId`, and `getUserExperiments` are common API calls. Error handling often involves setting `snackbar_state` messages for user feedback.

## 18:06:26
The project primarily involves development and refinement of a checkout UI for "gokwik.pdp", utilizing Svelte components and a modular service-oriented architecture. The changes observed span across managing gift card redemptions (Gyftr), handling Goods and Services Tax (GST) details and billing addresses, and core application flow.

    *   **24/10/2025, 17:48:21:** An `analyticsPixelObj` variable was introduced at the module level and assigned data for broader access.
    *   **24/10/2025, 17:49:23:** The `createBody` function was updated to directly include properties from the module-level `analyticsPixelObj` into the CleverTap event payload.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Svelte for UI and State Management:** The project consistently uses Svelte components (`.svelte` files) and its reactive stores (`store_...`) to build the UI and manage application state across different modules (e.g., login, address, payments, discounts).
*   **Detailed Event Logging:** A pervasive pattern is the use of `logEvent` (from `common/services/EventService`) to track user interactions and critical application states (e.g., `gst_field_shown`, `checkout_assets_loaded`, `gyftr_balance_redeemed`). This indicates a strong focus on analytics and understanding user behavior within the checkout flow.
*   **Iterative Development and Debugging:** Frequent additions and removals of `console.log` statements, along with minor changes and subsequent reversions in various `.svelte` components, suggest an agile development process involving continuous testing and debugging.
*   **Modular Service Architecture:** Functionalities are encapsulated in distinct service files (e.g., `Gyftr.service.ts`, `Discounts.service.ts`, `CleverTap.ts`), promoting maintainability and separation of concerns. These services often subscribe to global stores and interact with `MerchantAPI` for backend communication.
*   **Checkout Flow Progression:** The changes demonstrate a structured approach to the checkout funnel, addressing specific stages like address input and validation, GST details, discount application, and payment method selection.
*   **UI Feedback and Error Handling:** The `snackbar_state.set()` function is commonly used across components to provide consistent user feedback for successful operations and errors.

# Activity Summary for 18/10/2025

## 14:29:39
Changes were observed across two files related to a GoKwik checkout UI project, all occurring on `17/10/2025` within a short timeframe, indicating a focused period of development or testing.

1.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** Two updates at `21:35:00` and `21:35:08`.
    *   **Summary:** This file serves as a central point for managing environment-specific configurations for various GoKwik services. It defines functions to return appropriate base URLs for health checks, address suggestions, core APIs, experimental features, payment gateways (Twidpay, KP), CDN paths, and analytics endpoints, based on the current `env` variable. It also contains logic to retrieve and set merchant-related information and tokens. The brief interval between the two timestamps suggests a quick refinement, specifically noted in the adjustment of a `local` environment API URL configuration.
    *   *Note: Specific environment URLs, tokens, and sensitive cart data embedded within the `setCart` function's JSON object are omitted from this summary as per instructions to avoid detailing environment files or keys.*

2.  **`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp:** An update at `21:35:35`.
    *   **Summary:** This HTML file acts as a local development or testing page for the GoKwik checkout SDK. It includes a custom UI for developers to input a merchant ID and cart data in JSON format, select an environment, save these details to cookies, and then initiate the GoKwik checkout process. The page integrates the GoKwik SDK via a script and contains client-side JavaScript for handling user interactions, cookie management, and communication with the SDK. It sets up a `window.merchantInfo` object for passing initial configuration to the SDK.
    *   *Note: Specific merchant IDs, application IDs, secrets, Facebook pixel IDs, store IDs, and hardcoded `merchantInfo` values are omitted from this summary as per instructions to avoid detailing environment files or keys.*

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **GoKwik Ecosystem:** Both files are integral to the GoKwik checkout UI, with the `.ts` file handling backend service routing and the `.html` file providing a client-side interface for testing the integration.
*   **Environment Management:** A strong emphasis on distinguishing between various development, QA, sandbox, and production environments for different services (APIs, analytics, CDN, etc.) is evident.
*   **Developer Tooling/Testing:** The `merchant.html` file explicitly serves as a developer tool, providing input fields and buttons to simulate a merchant's integration with the GoKwik SDK for testing purposes.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The close timestamps for changes in `EnvironmentService.ts` suggest quick adjustments or debugging during development.
*   **Hardcoded Test Data/Configurations:** Both files, especially the `merchant.html`, contain hardcoded configurations and placeholder data, typical for a development or testing environment.

# Activity Summary for 22/10/2025

The changes log details updates across a checkout UI project, focusing on configuration, a merchant test page, and a UI component.

**File-specific Updates and Significant Timestamps:**

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/utils/ConstantVariables.ts (22/10/2025, 11:48:58)**:
    This file received a comprehensive update, introducing various constants and configurations for the checkout UI:
    *   **Payment UI Customization**: `InititalConstants` was defined to allow customization of text messages (e.g., discount, COD fees) and colors for different payment methods like UPI, COD, Cards, Wallets, BNPL, CredPay, and EMI. Button colors are standardized (white text on blue background) while badge colors are primarily black. A non-refundable subtext was added for PPCOD.
    *   **Validation and Address Defaults**: `cardValidationError` messages and `partailAddressInitialValue` for address forms were specified.
    *   **Feature Toggles and A/B Testing**: Extensive `experiments` and `experimentVariants` objects were added. This collection covers numerous UI/UX experiments, including different payment method displays, UI layouts (old/new), two-step COD flows, UPI configurations (intent fallback, QR desktop), pricing displays (slash, tiered), and offer visibility (Cred banner, payment offers). This indicates a strong emphasis on testing and dynamic feature rollout.
    *   **Error Reporting and Metrics**: A detailed `errorEvents` object categorizes API failures and high load times across various payment method screens (UPI, Cards, Wallets, Netbanking, EMI, BNPL, Snapmint, CredPay, PPCOD, COD, Coupons, BharatXPay, Simpl). This is complemented by `loadTimeVariables` to link screen names to specific error events, suggesting robust analytics and monitoring capabilities.
    *   Other constants include `MIN_ORDER_VALUE_FOR_EMI_ELIGIBILITY`, `upiPaymentType`, and `pageNames`.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html (22/10/2025, 11:51:20)**:
    This file was updated to serve as a development or testing page for merchants integrating the Gokwik SDK.
    *   It embeds a `gokwikSdk` JavaScript utility for initializing the SDK, processing payments, and managing SDK-related events. The SDK script is set to load from `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js`.
    *   Client-side cookie functions (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) were added to track referrer and landing page information.
    *   A `window.merchantInfo` object is configured with mock merchant details (ID, environment, store ID, Facebook pixel) to simulate a merchant's setup.
    *   The page provides a form to manually input merchant ID and JSON cart data, which can then be saved to cookies and used to initiate the checkout process via a "Inititate Checkout" button.
    *   Basic styling for the form elements and error display is included.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/TrustBanner.svelte (Multiple changes between 22/10/2025, 11:55:42 and 12:00:00)**:
    This Svelte component manages a dynamic, auto-sliding "Trust Banner" within the UI.
    *   It subscribes to a `store_trustBannerData` to retrieve banner content, supporting both default and custom lists of trust messages. The banner list is augmented with a duplicate of the first item to enable a smooth, continuous carousel loop.
    *   The component sets up an interval to automatically advance slides (`nextSlide()`).
    *   **Timestamp 11:57:10**: A small but important robustness improvement was made by adding optional chaining (`bannerList?.length`) when checking the banner list's length, preventing potential runtime errors if `bannerList` is not yet defined.
    *   **Timestamp 11:58:26**: A `console.log(bannerList)` statement was temporarily added, indicating debugging activity during development.
    *   **Timestamp 11:59:53**: The condition to enable the auto-sliding interval was adjusted from requiring more than one item (`bannerList?.length > 1`) to requiring more than two items (`bannerList?.length > 2`). This change ensures the carousel only auto-slides when there are at least three distinct banners to display, providing a more meaningful user experience for the animation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Configurability**: A strong pattern across the changes is the emphasis on external configuration and dynamic content. This is evident in the `ConstantVariables.ts` file's comprehensive `experiments` and payment UI settings, and in the `TrustBanner.svelte` component's ability to switch between standard and custom banner data.
*   **Checkout UI Focus**: All changes relate directly to the "checkout UI," covering payment method configurations, merchant integration, and trust-building UI elements.
*   **Iterative Development**: The sequence of minor updates in `TrustBanner.svelte` (type adjustments, optional chaining, debugging, logic refinement) highlights an iterative and continuous development approach, focusing on improving component robustness and user experience.
*   **Monitoring and Analytics**: The detailed `errorEvents` in `ConstantVariables.ts` and the presence of analytics script loading in `merchant.html` suggest a critical focus on understanding user behavior, performance, and error states within the checkout flow.

# Activity Summary for 17/10/2025

## 11:56:36
The log details changes across two main areas: UI configuration and a specific UI component.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (Timestamp: 17/10/2025, 11:20:06)**
    This file represents a comprehensive HTML/EJS template for the "Gokwik Dashboard". It outlines the core structure, including meta tags for standard attributes and a strict Content Security Policy. A `window.fcWidgetMessengerConfig` is initialized. Critically, it defines environment-specific SystemJS import maps, dynamically loading various `@gokwik` micro-frontend modules (e.g., `configuration`, `utilities`, `dashboard`, `checkout`, `payment`, `kwikpass`, `rto`, `kwikship`, `ellora`, `checkout-platform`, `shopify-app`) from different development, QA, and sandbox URLs. Shared dependencies like `react` and `react-dom` are loaded from a CDN. The production environment configuration includes integrations for Microsoft Clarity and New Relic browser monitoring, indicating a focus on analytics and performance tracking for live deployments.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/setup/discountCartItems.tsx`**
    This React component, `SetupDiscountCartItems`, is responsible for configuring discount properties within a form. It allows users to set discount types (percentage or fixed amount) and their respective values, with dynamic UI adjustments based on selections.
    *   **Initial State (Timestamp: 17/10/2025, 11:21:57)**: The component provides UI for selecting discount type, entering discount value (with appropriate suffixes/prefixes), setting discount capping for percentage-based discounts, and an option to apply fixed discounts "once per order". When "fixed" is selected as the discount type, `discountCartItemsOncePerOrder` is automatically set to `true`.
    *   **Debugging Addition (Timestamp: 17/10/2025, 11:22:59)**: A `console.log(discountApplicableOn)` statement was temporarily added, likely for debugging purposes.
    *   **Conditional Logic Update (Timestamp: 17/10/2025, 11:23:52)**: The visibility of the "Only apply discount once per order" checkbox for fixed discounts was changed to appear only when `discountApplicableOn` is `'allProducts'`.
    *   **Debugging Removal (Timestamp: 17/10/2025, 11:24:20)**: The `console.log` statement was removed, reverting that specific change.
    *   **Conditional Logic Reversal (Timestamp: 17/10/2025, 11:25:06)**: The visibility condition for the "Only apply discount once per order" checkbox was reversed. It is now displayed for fixed discounts when `discountApplicableOn` is *not* `'allProducts'`. This implies a significant change in how fixed discounts are applied based on product applicability.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **17/10/2025, 11:20:06**: The `index.ejs` file was established, defining the overarching micro-frontend architecture and environment-specific configurations for the Gokwik Dashboard.
*   **17/10/2025, 11:23:52** and **17/10/2025, 11:25:06**: These two timestamps mark the key logical modifications to the `discountCartItems.tsx` component, specifically altering when the "Only apply discount once per order" checkbox is shown for fixed-amount discounts.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Gokwik Ecosystem**: The project is clearly centered around a "Gokwik" product line, with several UI components and API endpoints referencing "gokwik."
*   **Micro-frontend Architecture**: The `index.ejs` file prominently features SystemJS import maps, dynamically loading various `@gokwik` modules based on the deployment environment, indicating a micro-frontend approach for the dashboard UI.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration**: A strong pattern of tailoring configurations (API URLs, module imports) to different environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production) is evident.
*   **Dashboard UI Development**: The file paths suggest active development on user interfaces related to a checkout dashboard.
*   **Form-Driven UI**: The `discountCartItems.tsx` component demonstrates a common pattern of building dynamic UI based on user input within a form, using form-watching hooks to conditionally render fields and update values.
*   **Rapid Iteration/Debugging**: The series of quick changes (adding/removing `console.log`, tweaking conditions) in `discountCartItems.tsx` within a few minutes suggests ongoing development, testing, and refinement of UI logic.

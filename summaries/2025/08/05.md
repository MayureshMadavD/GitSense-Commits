# Activity Summary for 05/08/2025

## 10:41:35
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file between 20:19:32 and 21:43:02 on April 8, 2025.  These updates primarily involve modifications to the component's logic for handling discounts, coupons, and payment offers.  The code heavily utilizes Svelte stores (`store_...`) to manage application state, indicating a reactive approach to UI updates.  There's a significant amount of code dedicated to handling various discount types, including automatic discounts, stacked discounts, payment offers (UPI, cards, wallets, EMI), and partner acquisition offers (e.g., Cred). The logic includes filtering, sorting, and applying these offers based on various conditions (screen size, user type, payment method availability etc.).  The code also incorporates event tracking using `logEvent` for analytics purposes.  The `onMount` lifecycle function subscribes to multiple stores to update various variables and flags influencing the UI and discount logic.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file also undergoes multiple updates during the same period. These changes modify the base URLs for various APIs and services based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  The `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, and `analytics_api` functions dynamically determine the appropriate URL based on the `env` variable, which is derived from a store (`store_environment`).  Several commented-out lines suggest experimentation with different API endpoints for the 'local' environment.   The token generation functions (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) also depend on the `env` variable to return different tokens for different environments.

Finally, the `.gitignore` file is updated multiple times, reflecting changes in how the project ignores files and directories. The primary change seems to be in the specificity of ignoring `EnvironmentService.ts`.  Initially it was listed, then removed, added back with different path specifiers (`*/`, `**/`) and finally settled back on listing it directly. This suggests some initial uncertainty about exactly how to manage this file in version control.

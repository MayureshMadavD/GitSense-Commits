# Activity Summary for 04/08/2025

## 11:18:40
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` underwent a minor update between 11:02:58 and 11:04:01 on 04/08/2025.  The primary change involves the `onMount` function's `window.onpopstate` event handler. Specifically, the condition that determines the page redirection on back button press was altered. The original code used `currentPage > 7`  to trigger a specific action. The updated code replaces this with `[14, 11, 12, 13].includes(currentPage)`, indicating a change in how specific page numbers (11, 12, 13, and 14) are now handled differently when the back button is pressed compared to other page numbers.  The rest of the code, including numerous imports of Svelte components, stores, services, and utility functions, remained consistent across both timestamps.  The extensive use of stores suggests a reactive data management approach. The code deals with checkout processes, handling various payment methods, user authentication, and error states.  The `window.addEventListener('message')` function shows that the application communicates with an iframe, likely for handling external processes such as handling a checkout link.

The log shows several code changes across two files, `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`, primarily between 12:40 PM and 13:17 PM on 04/08/2025.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`: This file, which appears to manage environment-specific configurations, underwent multiple updates throughout the logged period.  The core changes revolve around the `api_url` function, which dynamically sets API base URLs based on the environment variable `env`. Numerous environment settings (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.) were added or modified, suggesting ongoing development and testing across various environments. The  `setCart` function within this file was modified multiple times with changes to the cart object's `token` property and the addition or removal of items within the cart's `items` array. This is indicative of ongoing cart management and free gift related updates to the application.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`: This Svelte component, responsible for displaying the order summary, saw substantial changes, particularly in its reactive statements (`$:`) and event handlers.  The `totalPrice` reactive declaration was adjusted multiple times to include or exclude various cost components (e.g., prepaid discounts, COD charges, loyalty rewards), indicating refinements to order pricing calculations. There were many updates to the `handleCartUpdate` function which processes and updates the cart object and the handling of free gifts, indicating updates to the logic that handles discount application, free gifts, and total price calculation based on the current page and order type. The use of numerous Svelte stores (`store_...`) suggests a robust state management system. The inclusion of analytics tracking events (`fireGtmEvent`, `fireAnalyticsGa4`, `logEvent`) in the component shows a focus on monitoring user interactions and order details.  The  `methodsWithoutExternalPages` constant was added to simplify logic within the calculation of the `totalPrice`.  This suggests a refactoring of the code and attempts to improve maintainability and readability.

The most significant changes in both files occurred towards the end of the log, between 13:10 PM and 13:17 PM. This period shows frequent edits within the `EnvironmentService.ts` file and subsequently to the `OrderSummary.svelte` file, strongly suggesting a closely related change workflow, possibly focused on resolving conflicts between different environment configurations and order summary calculations.  The pattern across all changes is a strong emphasis on accurate price calculation based on various conditions, environment specific API URLs, and free gift additions.

The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was modified twice, at 13:19:26 and 13:37:36.  Both updates involve changes to the Javascript code within the file. These changes appear to be related to integrating a payment gateway (possibly Gokwik) and managing merchant information.  The changes include adding and removing commented-out script tags and adjustments to the `window.merchantInfo` object, which contains various merchant IDs ('mid') suggesting testing across different environments (qa, sandbox, production).  Cookie management for tracking landing pages and referrer information is also present.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file was updated multiple times (13:35:47, 13:41:55, 13:43:09, 13:44:41, 13:50:55, 14:01:38, 14:07:58, 14:11:33, 14:17:59).  This file is a Svelte component managing discounts and offers at checkout.  The repeated updates suggest iterative development and debugging.  Each update adds or refactors code related to discount application, various types of offers (gift cards, loyalty programs, partner acquisitions), and error handling.  The component heavily relies on Svelte stores for managing application state.  The large amount of code and numerous updates indicate the complexity of the discount logic, which includes handling various types of discounts, automatic discounts, stacking logic and UI updates.  A recurring pattern is the extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) to manage various aspects of the checkout process, demonstrating a reactive application architecture.

# Activity Summary for 04/08/2025

## 11:18:40
The Svelte component `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` underwent a minor update between 11:02:58 and 11:04:01 on 04/08/2025.  The primary change involves the `onMount` function's `window.onpopstate` event handler. Specifically, the condition that determines the page redirection on back button press was altered. The original code used `currentPage > 7`  to trigger a specific action. The updated code replaces this with `[14, 11, 12, 13].includes(currentPage)`, indicating a change in how specific page numbers (11, 12, 13, and 14) are now handled differently when the back button is pressed compared to other page numbers.  The rest of the code, including numerous imports of Svelte components, stores, services, and utility functions, remained consistent across both timestamps.  The extensive use of stores suggests a reactive data management approach. The code deals with checkout processes, handling various payment methods, user authentication, and error states.  The `window.addEventListener('message')` function shows that the application communicates with an iframe, likely for handling external processes such as handling a checkout link.

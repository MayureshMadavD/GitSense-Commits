# Activity Summary for 22/08/2025

## 11:29:58
The commit on `editAbcCart.tsx` (22/08/2025, 11:29:03) extensively modifies a React component for managing abandoned carts.  The component interacts with several APIs (`getCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `getCustomerAddresses`, `getAddress`, a createOrder endpoint) to fetch and update customer details, addresses, and order information.  It uses `makeAPICall` for API interactions and `gokwik-ui-kit` components for the UI.  Significant functionality includes:

* **Customer Management:**  Fetching customer details by phone number or phone hash, creating new customers, and managing customer addresses.  Error handling is included for API calls.
* **Address Management:** Fetching and creating shipping addresses. The component uses `fetchAddress` and `createAddress` functions to interact with the backend.
* **Order Creation:** Creating orders with various payment methods (COD, PP-COD, payment link, SMS/Whatsapp notification).  The `createOrder` function handles different payment scenarios and notifies the customer via different channels.
* **State Management:** Uses React's `useState` hook to manage a large amount of application state, including customer information, addresses, order details, and UI flags.  The `updateState` function helps to maintain the state consistently.  The state includes flags for various UI elements and actions (modals, loading indicators, etc.).
* **UI Interactions:** Utilizes numerous components from `gokwik-ui-kit` for creating a form-based user interface.  These include components for forms, inputs, buttons, modals, and more.
* **Discount and Shipping:** Includes logic for handling discounts and shipping, potentially based on a merchant configuration (`useMerchantConfigApi`).


The code snippet is incomplete, cutting off mid-`createOrder` function.  The full function's implementation and any further functionality are unknown from this excerpt.  The extensive use of state variables and API calls suggests a complex component responsible for a large portion of the checkout process.

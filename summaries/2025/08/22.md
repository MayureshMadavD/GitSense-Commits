# Activity Summary for 22/08/2025

## 11:29:58
The commit on `editAbcCart.tsx` (22/08/2025, 11:29:03) extensively modifies a React component for managing abandoned carts.  The component interacts with several APIs (`getCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `getCustomerAddresses`, `getAddress`, a createOrder endpoint) to fetch and update customer details, addresses, and order information.  It uses `makeAPICall` for API interactions and `gokwik-ui-kit` components for the UI.  Significant functionality includes:

* **Customer Management:**  Fetching customer details by phone number or phone hash, creating new customers, and managing customer addresses.  Error handling is included for API calls.
* **Address Management:** Fetching and creating shipping addresses. The component uses `fetchAddress` and `createAddress` functions to interact with the backend.
* **Order Creation:** Creating orders with various payment methods (COD, PP-COD, payment link, SMS/Whatsapp notification).  The `createOrder` function handles different payment scenarios and notifies the customer via different channels.
* **State Management:** Uses React's `useState` hook to manage a large amount of application state, including customer information, addresses, order details, and UI flags.  The `updateState` function helps to maintain the state consistently.  The state includes flags for various UI elements and actions (modals, loading indicators, etc.).
* **UI Interactions:** Utilizes numerous components from `gokwik-ui-kit` for creating a form-based user interface.  These include components for forms, inputs, buttons, modals, and more.
* **Discount and Shipping:** Includes logic for handling discounts and shipping, potentially based on a merchant configuration (`useMerchantConfigApi`).


The code snippet is incomplete, cutting off mid-`createOrder` function.  The full function's implementation and any further functionality are unknown from this excerpt.  The extensive use of state variables and API calls suggests a complex component responsible for a large portion of the checkout process.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 11:38:17 and 12:10:46 on August 22, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: managing abandoned carts, fetching customer details, creating orders, and handling various payment methods (COD, payment links, etc.).  However, several minor modifications occurred across these revisions.

The most significant change is visible between 12:04:31 and 12:10:46 where a `notesForm` using `Form.useForm()` was added,  a `saveButtonVisible` state variable was introduced, and the `discountShipping` function's payload within `fetchAddress` was updated to include  `shipping: { custom_shipping: true, price: 0, }`.  This suggests the addition of a notes section to the abandoned cart interface and implementation of custom shipping functionality.


The other revisions show only minor code formatting differences, mainly involving the addition or removal of commas or curly braces in the `useState` declaration of the `state` variable,  indicating potential auto-formatting or minor code cleanup activities rather than significant functional changes.  The numerous API calls (`makeAPICall`) throughout the component to endpoints like `getCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, and `getCustomerAddresses` remain unchanged in their core logic.


## 14:29:59
The log shows two revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.merchant.integration/src/Helper.service.ts`, both on August 22, 2025.  The first revision was at 13:56:05 and the second at 14:00:32.  The changes are minor and primarily focused on the `createIntegrationScript` function.

Specifically, the revision made between 13:56:05 and 14:00:32 involves a small change in the error handling within the asynchronous function in `createIntegrationScript`.  The original code checked for the existence of `response` before proceeding; the updated version removes this check, simplifying the logic.  The core functionality of fetching from `experimentServiceUrl.production` to determine UI variant and loading the appropriate `gokwik.js` remains unchanged. The function handles different environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production) for both gokwik.js and analytics URLs.  It uses experiment IDs ('683413f44669c3cd754a15aa', '686bcd0cbf2fb4c25dce1392', '6851485010bce9b0dcd2c74a') to determine which UI to load (new or old) based on merchant ID and user ID (obtained from cookies or session storage).  The code extensively uses `window.postMessage` for communication and includes functions for event handling (`window.gokwikSdk.on`, `window.gokwikSdk.emit`), button hiding (`window.gokwikSdk.hideButton`), and script loading (`loadScript`).  The `addCartBuyNow` function handles adding products to the cart and triggering the Gokwik checkout, differentiating between headless and traditional flows.  The `retrieveCart` function manages cart retrieval after modal closure.  Lists of `gkNewUIMerchants` and `oldUiMerchants` suggest A/B testing or phased rollout of a new UI.  The code also shows an integration with various analytics events using a `logEvent` function (implementation not shown).

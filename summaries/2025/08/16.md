# Activity Summary for 16/08/2025

## 13:50:06
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` was updated on 16/08/2025 at 11:51:23.  The update involved modifications to the `fetchProductBasedShippingColumnData` function. This function processes shipping data to generate table data (`tableData`), columns (`columns`), and form fields (`fields`) for a UI component, likely related to product-based shipping rules.

The `fields` array defines form elements for configuring shipping rules, including input fields for rule name and price, a select for mapping to shipping IDs, radio buttons for calculation methods, and switches for price multipliers and weight combination.  Product and collection selection is handled via custom rendered `ProductSearch` components.

The `columns` array defines the structure of a table displaying shipping rule details.  It includes columns for rule ID, name, mapped shipping ID, calculation method, price multiplier (rendered as a colored tag), weight combination (also a colored tag), product count, and collection count.

The `tableData` is derived from the input `data`, flattening nested product-based rules into a simpler array suitable for table display.  The function uses `flatMap` to handle potential absence of rules for some shipping options.  Error handling and input validation are present through the use of `rules` within the form field definitions.  The code heavily utilizes React components and functional programming patterns.

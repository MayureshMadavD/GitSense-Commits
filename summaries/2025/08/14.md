# Activity Summary for 14/08/2025

## 12:48:28
The provided code represents a React component (`GiftCardsVouchers`) for managing gift card and voucher integration settings.  Two log entries show nearly identical code, suggesting a minor, insignificant change between 12:12:31 and 12:12:39 on 14/08/2025. The only discernible difference is a likely unintentional change in `populateForm()` function, specifically within the `custom_config` object assignment, where `enable_prepaid_discount_with_rewards` changed from negation of `customConfig` value to the original value.

The component interacts with a backend API (`useMerchantConfigApi`) to fetch and save configuration. It handles various gift card and voucher providers (Shopify, Qwickcilver, Gyftr, Internal Wallet, Nector Credits), allowing users to enable/disable them and customize settings via a drawer. The `handleSwitchChange` function updates the configuration based on user toggles, while `handleSave` persists changes to the backend, handling different data structures for each provider.  The component uses Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) for state management and `deepEqualAndDiff` for efficient change detection before saving.  The `populateForm` function pre-fills the form with existing configuration data.  The code extensively uses conditional logic to manage the interaction between different providers and their settings, ensuring mutual exclusivity where necessary.  Error handling is implemented using `message.error` for UI feedback.

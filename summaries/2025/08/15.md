# Activity Summary for 15/08/2025

## 13:30:34
The log shows multiple updates to the shipping settings components of a React-based checkout dashboard UI.  The updates span from August 14th, 2025, to August 15th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` underwent significant changes.  Initially, it was a simple placeholder component. It was then progressively developed, adding a `Form` component, a `Card`, and finally a `Table` to display product-based shipping rules.  The final version incorporates `useMerchantConfigApi` to fetch and display configuration data and uses a  `Table` component from `gokwik-ui-kit` to present shipping rules, along with `Tag` components for visual indication of rule status (Enabled/Disabled).  The key changes in this file happened between 22:33:33 and 00:33:03 on August 15th.  The inclusion of `fetchProductBasedShippingColumnData`  at 00:37:43 simplifies the code by extracting the table data and column definition to another component.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` was updated several times on August 14th between 22:23:49 and 22:26:23, with minor revisions to imports and code formatting, and a substantial change at 22:26:23, adding more robust error handling and input validation for CSV file uploads.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/weightShipping.tsx`  received updates on August 14th, showing a refinement of the component's functionality, with a focus on weight-based shipping configuration.  There is a slight change between 22:22:50 and 22:22:57, primarily the path in `updateBreadcrumbs`. Another update happened on August 14th, at 22:26:39, primarily removing the `useEffect` hook that called `updateBreadcrumbs`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx` shows several updates on August 14th and 15th.  These updates primarily focus on adjusting tab indices and refining the logic for displaying different shipping methods (Shipping Method, Product Based Shipping, Weight Based Shipping, Discount Based Shipping).  The most significant changes happened around 22:38:51 and 00:21:28 on August 15th,  resulting in a more robust handling of tab switching and data fetching.  The `destroyInactiveTabPane` option was added to the `Tabs` component for performance enhancement.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx`  has one entry on August 14th at 22:21:29, showing the initial structure of the main shipping settings page. It uses components created and modified throughout the other log entries to render different shipping options.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` contains a single entry from August 15th, 00:00:44, introducing various interfaces that likely support data structures related to the shipping settings features.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/columnData.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` were added on August 15th to improve code organization, extracting the logic for generating table data and columns into reusable functions. This extraction improves maintainability and readability. The most significant change was the addition of the `fields` variable for defining Form components.

A recurring theme is the use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements and the consistent use of `useEffect` hooks to manage data fetching and state updates. The overall development pattern shows iterative development with a gradual refinement of the UI and functionality.

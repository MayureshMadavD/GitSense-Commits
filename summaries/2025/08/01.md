# Activity Summary for 01/08/2025

## 12:48:41
The log shows code changes across three files between 12:41 PM and 12:46 PM on January 8, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`: This file, updated at 12:41:07 PM, is an HTML page containing a "click me" button that triggers a checkout process via JavaScript using the `gokwikSdk`.  The JavaScript code manages communication with a GoKwik SDK (likely a payment gateway) via `postMessage`.  It also includes cookie management for tracking landing pages and referrer URLs,  and various `mid` (merchant ID) values are commented, suggesting testing across different environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  The analytics tracking is implemented with an inline script.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`: This TypeScript file, updated twice (12:41:39 PM and 12:41:53 PM), defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health check, address suggestions, APIs, etc.) based on the current environment (`env`). The `env` variable is dynamically determined and used to construct different API endpoints. The  `api_url` function includes a large number of environment-specific URLs, indicating the system supports many environments.  A notable change between the two updates is the `local` environment's `api_url` being updated from commented-out options to `https://api.gokwik.co`.  This suggests a shift to a production or stable API for local development or testing.  The file also includes functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) based on the environment and manages a cart object.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/OfferBanner.svelte`: This Svelte component, updated three times (12:44:25 PM, 12:46:35 PM, 12:46:58 PM), renders an offer banner.  The banner's content and styling are dynamically determined based on configuration data (`reqIdObject.custom_config`) and the current page (`$store_page`).  The component uses reactive statements (`$:` ) to efficiently update the UI based on changes in these variables.  The most significant change across the three updates is the use of `bannerData.banner_content?.actualText` being replaced with `bannerData.banner_content?.actualString` and then `bannerData.banner_content?.actualText`.  This shows ongoing adjustments to how banner text is accessed and handled within the component.


Overall, the changes indicate active development and testing across multiple environments.  There is a focus on dynamic configuration and environment-specific URLs to manage API calls.  The frequent updates to the OfferBanner component suggest refinements in how banner content is displayed and managed based on conditional logic.


## 13:48:38
The provided log shows updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project.  The most significant changes occur in `EnvironmentService.ts` on January 8th, 2025, between 13:17:22 and 13:17:39.  These changes involve modifications to the `api_url` function within `EnvironmentService.ts`. Specifically, a commented-out section in the `local` environment case was updated.  The `local` environment now defaults to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` instead of other commented-out options.  No other functional changes are apparent in the diff between these two timestamps.


The `merchant.html` file was updated at 13:18:13 on the same day. This update primarily involves JavaScript code managing a Gokwik SDK,  including functions for payment processing (`processPayment`), event handling (`on`, `emit`), initialization (`init`), and button hiding (`hideButton`).  The script also sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to track the landing page and referrer. The `merchant.html` file also includes hardcoded merchant information (`merchantInfo`),  potentially for testing purposes,  with different `mid` values for various environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  A commented-out section shows previous attempts to dynamically load the `gokwik.js` script, which is now handled differently within the Gokwik SDK initialization. The inclusion of analytics tracking, although commented out initially, is present suggesting that integration is anticipated.  The file also contains some seemingly extraneous HTML related to a marketing/promotions widget.


## 14:48:41
The code changes span several files related to a GoKwik checkout UI.  Significant updates occurred on January 8th, 2025, between 13:55 and 14:01.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (13:55:02): This file manages environment-specific API URLs and configurations.  It defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestions, APIs, etc.) based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The code extensively handles different environment variables and provides specific URLs for each.  A noteworthy aspect is the extensive conditional logic to determine the correct URL based on the environment, including fallback options and special cases like `local` environment.  It also manages the generation of tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) dependent on the environment.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with sample data, suggesting this file's role in setting up the initial application state.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (13:56:11): This HTML file represents the merchant's integration page.  It contains a button triggering a checkout process, using  `postMessage` to communicate with a GoKwik SDK. The code includes a significant amount of hardcoded merchant information (`mid`, `appid`, `appsecret`), potentially for testing purposes. There is also client-side Javascript managing cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) to track landing page and referrer information.  The script initializes the GoKwik SDK and handles communication with the parent window, likely an iframe embedding this merchant page, using `window.postMessage`.  The included merchantInfo object contains various details such as `environment`, `storeId`, and Facebook Pixel ID.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` (14:01:41): This Svelte component handles discount logic within the checkout flow. It interacts extensively with various stores (using Svelte's reactive declarations `$store_...`) to manage discounts, coupons, gift cards, loyalty points, and other promotional offers.  The component utilizes numerous functions from other services (`discountCall`, `applyCredOffer`, `removeCoupon`, etc.) to apply and remove discounts, fetch offers, and update the UI accordingly. The code is complex and manages multiple discount types, including automatic, manual, stacked discounts, and partner offers.  There's substantial logic for handling various states (e.g., `discountCouponApplied`, `creditsApplied`, `allowDiscountApplication`).  It features reactive statements (`$:`), indicating dynamic updates based on store changes. The numerous imports and conditional statements reflect a comprehensive system for managing discount applications in various scenarios.  The presence of `experimentVariants` suggests A/B testing is employed.  The code also handles interactions with multiple external services and APIs.

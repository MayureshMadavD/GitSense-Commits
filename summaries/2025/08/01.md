# Activity Summary for 01/08/2025

## 12:48:41
The log shows code changes across three files between 12:41 PM and 12:46 PM on January 8, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`: This file, updated at 12:41:07 PM, is an HTML page containing a "click me" button that triggers a checkout process via JavaScript using the `gokwikSdk`.  The JavaScript code manages communication with a GoKwik SDK (likely a payment gateway) via `postMessage`.  It also includes cookie management for tracking landing pages and referrer URLs,  and various `mid` (merchant ID) values are commented, suggesting testing across different environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  The analytics tracking is implemented with an inline script.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`: This TypeScript file, updated twice (12:41:39 PM and 12:41:53 PM), defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health check, address suggestions, APIs, etc.) based on the current environment (`env`). The `env` variable is dynamically determined and used to construct different API endpoints. The  `api_url` function includes a large number of environment-specific URLs, indicating the system supports many environments.  A notable change between the two updates is the `local` environment's `api_url` being updated from commented-out options to `https://api.gokwik.co`.  This suggests a shift to a production or stable API for local development or testing.  The file also includes functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) based on the environment and manages a cart object.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/OfferBanner.svelte`: This Svelte component, updated three times (12:44:25 PM, 12:46:35 PM, 12:46:58 PM), renders an offer banner.  The banner's content and styling are dynamically determined based on configuration data (`reqIdObject.custom_config`) and the current page (`$store_page`).  The component uses reactive statements (`$:` ) to efficiently update the UI based on changes in these variables.  The most significant change across the three updates is the use of `bannerData.banner_content?.actualText` being replaced with `bannerData.banner_content?.actualString` and then `bannerData.banner_content?.actualText`.  This shows ongoing adjustments to how banner text is accessed and handled within the component.


Overall, the changes indicate active development and testing across multiple environments.  There is a focus on dynamic configuration and environment-specific URLs to manage API calls.  The frequent updates to the OfferBanner component suggest refinements in how banner content is displayed and managed based on conditional logic.

# Activity Summary for 01/08/2025

## 12:48:41
The log shows code changes across three files between 12:41 PM and 12:46 PM on January 8, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`: This file, updated at 12:41:07 PM, is an HTML page containing a "click me" button that triggers a checkout process via JavaScript using the `gokwikSdk`.  The JavaScript code manages communication with a GoKwik SDK (likely a payment gateway) via `postMessage`.  It also includes cookie management for tracking landing pages and referrer URLs,  and various `mid` (merchant ID) values are commented, suggesting testing across different environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  The analytics tracking is implemented with an inline script.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`: This TypeScript file, updated twice (12:41:39 PM and 12:41:53 PM), defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health check, address suggestions, APIs, etc.) based on the current environment (`env`). The `env` variable is dynamically determined and used to construct different API endpoints. The  `api_url` function includes a large number of environment-specific URLs, indicating the system supports many environments.  A notable change between the two updates is the `local` environment's `api_url` being updated from commented-out options to `https://api.gokwik.co`.  This suggests a shift to a production or stable API for local development or testing.  The file also includes functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) based on the environment and manages a cart object.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/OfferBanner.svelte`: This Svelte component, updated three times (12:44:25 PM, 12:46:35 PM, 12:46:58 PM), renders an offer banner.  The banner's content and styling are dynamically determined based on configuration data (`reqIdObject.custom_config`) and the current page (`$store_page`).  The component uses reactive statements (`$:` ) to efficiently update the UI based on changes in these variables.  The most significant change across the three updates is the use of `bannerData.banner_content?.actualText` being replaced with `bannerData.banner_content?.actualString` and then `bannerData.banner_content?.actualText`.  This shows ongoing adjustments to how banner text is accessed and handled within the component.


Overall, the changes indicate active development and testing across multiple environments.  There is a focus on dynamic configuration and environment-specific URLs to manage API calls.  The frequent updates to the OfferBanner component suggest refinements in how banner content is displayed and managed based on conditional logic.


## 13:48:38
The provided log shows updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project.  The most significant changes occur in `EnvironmentService.ts` on January 8th, 2025, between 13:17:22 and 13:17:39.  These changes involve modifications to the `api_url` function within `EnvironmentService.ts`. Specifically, a commented-out section in the `local` environment case was updated.  The `local` environment now defaults to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` instead of other commented-out options.  No other functional changes are apparent in the diff between these two timestamps.


The `merchant.html` file was updated at 13:18:13 on the same day. This update primarily involves JavaScript code managing a Gokwik SDK,  including functions for payment processing (`processPayment`), event handling (`on`, `emit`), initialization (`init`), and button hiding (`hideButton`).  The script also sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to track the landing page and referrer. The `merchant.html` file also includes hardcoded merchant information (`merchantInfo`),  potentially for testing purposes,  with different `mid` values for various environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  A commented-out section shows previous attempts to dynamically load the `gokwik.js` script, which is now handled differently within the Gokwik SDK initialization. The inclusion of analytics tracking, although commented out initially, is present suggesting that integration is anticipated.  The file also contains some seemingly extraneous HTML related to a marketing/promotions widget.

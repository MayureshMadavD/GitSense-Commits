The log shows code changes in two files on August 13, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/integration-settings/giftCardVouchers.tsx` (08:03:52): This file contains a React component (`GiftCardsVouchers`) for managing gift card and voucher integrations.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components and interacts with Redux store using `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch`. Significant changes involve the management of multiple gift card providers (Shopify, Qwikcilver, Gyftr, Nector, Internal Wallet) and their enabled/disabled states.  The `handleSwitchChange` function controls enabling/disabling these providers, with logic to prevent conflicts. The `handleSave` function saves configuration changes to the server, handling different cases based on the selected provider and making API calls using `saveConfig`, `saveCreds`, and potentially others.  The component also features a drawer for customizing provider settings, populated using `populateForm` and using `deepEqualAndDiff` for efficient change detection. The code extensively uses conditional logic to manage the interactions between different types of gift cards and vouchers and their individual settings.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` (13:08:59): This file implements a React component for editing orders. It uses `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and interacts with an API (`makeAPICall`) for fetching and updating order data.  The component manages order line items, allowing addition, removal, and quantity modification.  It includes functionality for adding discounts (`discount` state), with options for fixed amount or percentage discounts.  The component displays order data in a table (`columns`, `data`) and features a modal for managing recently deleted items.  Significant updates include the addition of discount management features, improved UI elements and error handling (`message.error`), and the use of `useMemo` for performance optimization of calculations. The `handleReAddItem` function handles re-adding deleted items.  The component also uses `useLocation` and `useNavigate` for routing. The code uses numerous state variables to track different aspects of order details and discount information and employs a complex state management scheme.

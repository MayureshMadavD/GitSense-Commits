# Activity Summary for 11/08/2025

## 14:02:31
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` file was updated on 11/08/2025 at 14:02:03.  This React component, `DiscountVisibility`,  is a form for controlling the visibility and details of discount codes on a checkout dashboard.

The update involves significant changes to the UI for managing discount code visibility.  The form allows users to enable/disable discount code visibility, provide a description and additional details, and select visibility options ("Always" or "Only When Eligible").  Validation is implemented to ensure a description and visibility option are selected if visibility is enabled.  Further, it prevents setting visibility to "Always" for user-specific offers.

Conditional rendering is extensively used based on the `discountCodeVisibilityEnabled` state. When enabled, additional fields appear for description, details, visibility selection, and optional min/max price and quantity conditions.  These conditions are validated to ensure min values are less than max values.

The component also renders previews of how the discount code will appear to the customer, differentiating between when conditions are met and not met,  and includes informational alerts throughout. Finally, it provides links to further customize the UI.  The component utilizes React's `Form` and `Radio.Group` components from a `gokwik-ui-kit` library and Redux for state management via `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch`.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/`  across several files between 13:19 and 13:38 on November 8th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 13:19:16. This file is an HTML page containing Javascript code that interacts with a "gokwikSdk".  The Javascript manages payment processing using `window.postMessage`, initializes a script from `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js` or other URLs based on parameters, and sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`). The page also includes a button triggering a checkout function and various other UI elements.  The `merchantInfo` object contains sensitive data like merchant IDs, and app secrets which are masked here.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent multiple revisions (13:19:24, 13:19:39, 13:20:04, 13:35:31, 13:38:16). This TypeScript file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API endpoints, experiment, twidpay, kp, CDN, analytics) based on the current environment (`env`). The environment variable is fetched from the `LoginStore` and determines which API endpoints are used, with many different environments specified (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.). A significant change across these revisions appears to be in the `setCart()` function.  The cart object included in this function changes between revisions, indicating updates to the cart data itself.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`  was updated multiple times (13:29:45, 13:30:15, 13:34:49, 13:34:59). This Svelte component manages discount logic. The code is extensive and uses numerous stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage various aspects of the checkout process, including discounts,  shipping, payment methods, loyalty programs, gift cards, and analytics.  The  `allAppliedOffers` reactive declaration dynamically calculates and updates the list of applied discounts, which is further reflected in `store_allAppliedDiscounts`. The component also incorporates error handling, likely for API calls or discount processing issues.  The  `onMount` function subscribes to multiple stores and defines many variables associated with different kinds of discounts and their application, including several related to automatic discounts, the application of which depends on the runtime environment and server side configuration parameters.

In summary, the changes reflect updates to a checkout UI, encompassing front-end presentation, back-end API calls, and complex discount application logic. The frequent updates to `EnvironmentService.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` suggest ongoing development and refinement of the checkout experience and discount features. The evolution of the `setCart` function in `EnvironmentService.ts` indicates the implementation of dynamic cart data updates.

# Activity Summary for 11/08/2025

## 14:02:31
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` file was updated on 11/08/2025 at 14:02:03.  This React component, `DiscountVisibility`,  is a form for controlling the visibility and details of discount codes on a checkout dashboard.

The update involves significant changes to the UI for managing discount code visibility.  The form allows users to enable/disable discount code visibility, provide a description and additional details, and select visibility options ("Always" or "Only When Eligible").  Validation is implemented to ensure a description and visibility option are selected if visibility is enabled.  Further, it prevents setting visibility to "Always" for user-specific offers.

Conditional rendering is extensively used based on the `discountCodeVisibilityEnabled` state. When enabled, additional fields appear for description, details, visibility selection, and optional min/max price and quantity conditions.  These conditions are validated to ensure min values are less than max values.

The component also renders previews of how the discount code will appear to the customer, differentiating between when conditions are met and not met,  and includes informational alerts throughout. Finally, it provides links to further customize the UI.  The component utilizes React's `Form` and `Radio.Group` components from a `gokwik-ui-kit` library and Redux for state management via `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch`.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/`  across several files between 13:19 and 13:38 on November 8th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 13:19:16. This file is an HTML page containing Javascript code that interacts with a "gokwikSdk".  The Javascript manages payment processing using `window.postMessage`, initializes a script from `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js` or other URLs based on parameters, and sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`). The page also includes a button triggering a checkout function and various other UI elements.  The `merchantInfo` object contains sensitive data like merchant IDs, and app secrets which are masked here.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent multiple revisions (13:19:24, 13:19:39, 13:20:04, 13:35:31, 13:38:16). This TypeScript file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API endpoints, experiment, twidpay, kp, CDN, analytics) based on the current environment (`env`). The environment variable is fetched from the `LoginStore` and determines which API endpoints are used, with many different environments specified (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.). A significant change across these revisions appears to be in the `setCart()` function.  The cart object included in this function changes between revisions, indicating updates to the cart data itself.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`  was updated multiple times (13:29:45, 13:30:15, 13:34:49, 13:34:59). This Svelte component manages discount logic. The code is extensive and uses numerous stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage various aspects of the checkout process, including discounts,  shipping, payment methods, loyalty programs, gift cards, and analytics.  The  `allAppliedOffers` reactive declaration dynamically calculates and updates the list of applied discounts, which is further reflected in `store_allAppliedDiscounts`. The component also incorporates error handling, likely for API calls or discount processing issues.  The  `onMount` function subscribes to multiple stores and defines many variables associated with different kinds of discounts and their application, including several related to automatic discounts, the application of which depends on the runtime environment and server side configuration parameters.

In summary, the changes reflect updates to a checkout UI, encompassing front-end presentation, back-end API calls, and complex discount application logic. The frequent updates to `EnvironmentService.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` suggest ongoing development and refinement of the checkout experience and discount features. The evolution of the `setCart` function in `EnvironmentService.ts` indicates the implementation of dynamic cart data updates.


## 15:04:19
The log shows two revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` file.  Both revisions are nearly identical,  with the only difference being a small addition to the `InputNumber` components within the conditional rendering block for `showAdditionalConditions`. Specifically, the `precision` property is added to the `Min Price` and `Max Price` `InputNumber` components, setting it to `0`. This change occurred between 14:04:11 and 14:08:17 on November 8th, 2025.  The component is a React functional component responsible for rendering a form related to discount code visibility settings.  The form allows users to enable/disable discount code visibility, provide a description and details, select visibility options (always or only when eligible), and set minimum and maximum price and quantity conditions. The code extensively uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.  There's also a significant amount of conditional rendering based on the state of the form and the data fetched from the Redux store via `useSelector`.  Validation is implemented using custom validator functions within the `Form.Item` components to ensure data integrity.  The component also displays informative alerts to guide the user through the settings.


## 16:02:31
The log shows several updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` between 15:26:44 and 15:31:51 on November 8th, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor refinements to the `fetchCustomer` function. Specifically, the way the `createCustomer` function is called within `fetchCustomer`  when the customer is not found is altered. In the initial versions, `createCustomer` was called with `{phone}` as the argument. In the final version, it was changed to `{phone}`. There are no substantial functional changes reflected in the code snippets provided.  The `package.json` file was updated at 15:57:32 on the same day, but the content change is unrelated to the edits in `editAbcCart.tsx`.  The `package.json` update shows various dependencies and scripts for the project, including build, test, and linting configurations.


## 17:02:38
The log shows several code modifications across multiple files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` directory between 16:33 and 17:00 on November 8th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on address input and management within a checkout UI, with substantial updates to the `/src/Components/address/Address.svelte`  and `/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` files.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent two nearly identical updates within a minute (16:33:40 and 16:33:51). These changes involve defining functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs (health service, address suggestion, etc.) based on the current environment ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.). The `api_url` function is particularly extensive, handling numerous environment-specific URLs.  A minor difference is observed in the `local` environment URL handling where one version had several commented-out options, the second version only had one commented-out option and the `sandbox` url was uncommented.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 16:34:15. This file contains HTML for a merchant page, incorporating a GoKwik SDK initialization script.  The script handles communication with the GoKwik system via `postMessage`, initiating the checkout process, and managing cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`).  The script also includes some analytics setup.  Note that the `data-mid`, `data-appid`, and `data-appsecret` attributes within the HTML may contain sensitive information which has been omitted from this summary.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/Address.svelte` saw multiple revisions (16:35:48, 16:37:45, 16:44:33, 16:44:52, 16:45:13, 16:48:17, 16:48:23, and 16:58:51).  These revisions are substantial and iterative. The file is a Svelte component responsible for rendering the address input form, with features such as pincode validation, geolocation integration (`triggerGeolocationAPI`, `geoLocationMessageListener`), and conditional rendering based on user state (e.g., `$store_show_input`, `$store_editAddress`).  The most significant changes are related to handling the shipping address input, various error states, and integration with partner acquisition offers (indicated by `usePartnerOfferCss`).  There is also ongoing work and refinement of the address handling, such as changes to how  `pincode` values are handled and updated.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/addressSuggestionHelper.ts` was updated twice in quick succession (16:47:51 and 16:48:11). This file contains helper functions for address suggestions and pincode submission.  `suggestAutoFillAddress` cleans and formats address input.  `mergeUserInputWithApiResponse` intelligently merges user input with API responses.  The `submitPincode` function is key, handling the verification of pincodes with a backend API and updating various store variables. `prefilledPincodeCall` validates and submits a pre-filled pincode. Additional validation functions are also included (`validateAddress`, `validateName`).  The changes between versions appears to be mainly stylistic/formatting.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` was updated at 16:59:34 and 17:00:10. This Svelte component handles the individual address input fields (name, address, email, etc.). It shows conditional rendering based on various store values (`store_additionalAddress`, `store_addressSuggestionFlow`, `store_optionalEmail`, etc.),  and manages validation states and error messages.  The component also interacts with various analytics services (`fireAnalytics`, `fireAnalyticsGa4`, etc.). The changes between revisions appear to be mainly stylistic/formatting.

In summary, the codebase is undergoing active development, particularly concerning the address input and validation components of a checkout process.  The updates show a strong emphasis on handling different environments, integrating geolocation, improving the user experience, and ensuring robust validation and error handling. The repeated modification in `Address.svelte` indicates an iterative refinement process.

# Activity Summary for 11/08/2025

## 14:02:31
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` file was updated on 11/08/2025 at 14:02:03.  This React component, `DiscountVisibility`,  is a form for controlling the visibility and details of discount codes on a checkout dashboard.

The update involves significant changes to the UI for managing discount code visibility.  The form allows users to enable/disable discount code visibility, provide a description and additional details, and select visibility options ("Always" or "Only When Eligible").  Validation is implemented to ensure a description and visibility option are selected if visibility is enabled.  Further, it prevents setting visibility to "Always" for user-specific offers.

Conditional rendering is extensively used based on the `discountCodeVisibilityEnabled` state. When enabled, additional fields appear for description, details, visibility selection, and optional min/max price and quantity conditions.  These conditions are validated to ensure min values are less than max values.

The component also renders previews of how the discount code will appear to the customer, differentiating between when conditions are met and not met,  and includes informational alerts throughout. Finally, it provides links to further customize the UI.  The component utilizes React's `Form` and `Radio.Group` components from a `gokwik-ui-kit` library and Redux for state management via `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch`.

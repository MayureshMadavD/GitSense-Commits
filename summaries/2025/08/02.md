# Activity Summary for 02/08/2025

## 00:04:51
The log shows code changes on January 8th, 2025, around 22:57.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated to include conditional logic for different deployment environments (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  This logic dynamically sets import maps for various @gokwik packages (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, kwikpass, rto, kwikship, ellora, checkout-platform, shopify-app, and kwikcomm), using different base URLs depending on the environment.  Local development uses localhost URLs for some packages. The production environment also includes scripts for clarity.ms and New Relic.  The  `index.ejs` file also includes  various meta tags,  CSP settings, and CDN links for React, React-DOM, and single-spa libraries, showing a React single-spa application setup.  The changes to this file represent a significant configuration update for the application's deployment and environment management.

The log shows code changes on February 8th, 2025, around 18:50.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated to manage different environment configurations (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The changes primarily involve modifying the `systemjs-importmap` script tag to point to different URLs for various modules (`@gokwik/*`) based on the `deployedEnv` variable.  For the production environment, it also conditionally includes Clarity and New Relic monitoring scripts, leveraging a `clarityKey` variable.  The New Relic integration includes extensive Javascript code for error handling and performance monitoring.  The conditional logic for different environments suggests a deployment pipeline and the usage of different API endpoints based on the deployment target.  The timestamp difference between the `.env` file and the `index.ejs` file indicates that the environment variables were likely set before the import map configuration was updated.

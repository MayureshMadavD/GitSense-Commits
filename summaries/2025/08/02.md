# Activity Summary for 02/08/2025

## 00:04:51
The log shows code changes on January 8th, 2025, around 22:57.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated to include conditional logic for different deployment environments (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  This logic dynamically sets import maps for various @gokwik packages (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, kwikpass, rto, kwikship, ellora, checkout-platform, shopify-app, and kwikcomm), using different base URLs depending on the environment.  Local development uses localhost URLs for some packages. The production environment also includes scripts for clarity.ms and New Relic.  The  `index.ejs` file also includes  various meta tags,  CSP settings, and CDN links for React, React-DOM, and single-spa libraries, showing a React single-spa application setup.  The changes to this file represent a significant configuration update for the application's deployment and environment management.

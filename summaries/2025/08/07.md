# Activity Summary for 07/08/2025

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated on 06/08/2025, 23:56:51.  This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs and services based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The logic extensively uses the `env` variable,  which is derived from a store and potentially from `window.merchantInfo`.  The file also includes functions to set and retrieve cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`), and defines  functions to return different URLs depending on environment for health checks, address suggestions, APIs (`api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`), CDN paths (`cdn_path`), and merchant URLs (`merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`). There's also logic to set a default cart object for the 'local' environment.  The functions `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` return different tokens based on the environment, suggesting they are environment-specific authentication tokens.  The numerous conditional statements within these functions indicate a complex mapping between environment and API endpoints.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated on 06/08/2025, 23:57:27. This file is an HTML page for a merchant, containing a button that triggers a checkout process using a GoKwik SDK.  The `merchantInfo` object is prominently featured, containing merchant-specific data such as `mid`, `environment`, and `storeId`.  The code includes logic to initialize the GoKwik SDK (`gokwikSdk.init()`) and manages cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) to track the landing page and referrer.  The script dynamically loads the GoKwik SDK depending on the environment, defaulting to `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js` and includes commented-out code which suggests previous versions of the script loading. The script also contains numerous commented-out `mid` values, suggesting experimentation with different merchant IDs. There is also code to load an analytics script but the contents are rather minimal.  The commented out analytics script and the presence of  `fbpixel` within `merchantInfo` suggests integration with Facebook Pixel.  The page also shows a Privy widget for marketing purposes.

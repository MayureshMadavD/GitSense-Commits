# Activity Summary for 18/08/2025

## 00:43:03
The log shows modifications to two files within the `checkout-dashboard-ui` project.  The primary focus is on `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`, which underwent three revisions between 23:29:42 and 23:30:39 on August 17, 2025.  These changes primarily involved adjustments to the `Drawer` component's width, increasing it from 400 to 550.  The code itself remained largely consistent, focusing on product-based shipping rule management using a form, table, and drawer for data input and display.  The  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` file was updated once at 23:34:59 on the same day. This update involved substantial changes to the `processProductBasedShippingData` function. This function handles the processing and display of product-based shipping data, including adding, deleting, and manipulating product and collection IDs in the UI using a table, and form components.  The changes include improved handling of product variants, error messages for duplicate entries, and a more robust data structure for managing products and collections associated with shipping rules.  Both files heavily utilize the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` was updated on 18/08/2025 at 10:36:54.  This React component (`ProductBasedShipping`) manages product-based shipping rules.  It uses a form (`Form.useForm`) to add new rules and displays existing rules in a table.  The component interacts with a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook to fetch and save shipping configurations. Key functionalities include: adding new rules via a form, displaying existing rules in a table, handling form submission (`handleFormSubmit`), preventing duplicate rule creation, and using a drawer for form input.  The code utilizes several UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (Button, Card, Col, Drawer, Form, message, Row, Table) and custom components/hooks from the `@library` directory (`processProductBasedShippingData`, `RenderField`, `useMerchantConfigApi`).  Error handling is implemented to prevent saving duplicate rules.  The `useEffect` hook updates the `shippingPrices` state based on the fetched configuration.

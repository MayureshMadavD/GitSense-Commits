# Activity Summary for 18/08/2025

## 00:43:03
The log shows modifications to two files within the `checkout-dashboard-ui` project.  The primary focus is on `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`, which underwent three revisions between 23:29:42 and 23:30:39 on August 17, 2025.  These changes primarily involved adjustments to the `Drawer` component's width, increasing it from 400 to 550.  The code itself remained largely consistent, focusing on product-based shipping rule management using a form, table, and drawer for data input and display.  The  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` file was updated once at 23:34:59 on the same day. This update involved substantial changes to the `processProductBasedShippingData` function. This function handles the processing and display of product-based shipping data, including adding, deleting, and manipulating product and collection IDs in the UI using a table, and form components.  The changes include improved handling of product variants, error messages for duplicate entries, and a more robust data structure for managing products and collections associated with shipping rules.  Both files heavily utilize the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` was updated on 18/08/2025 at 10:36:54.  This React component (`ProductBasedShipping`) manages product-based shipping rules.  It uses a form (`Form.useForm`) to add new rules and displays existing rules in a table.  The component interacts with a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook to fetch and save shipping configurations. Key functionalities include: adding new rules via a form, displaying existing rules in a table, handling form submission (`handleFormSubmit`), preventing duplicate rule creation, and using a drawer for form input.  The code utilizes several UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (Button, Card, Col, Drawer, Form, message, Row, Table) and custom components/hooks from the `@library` directory (`processProductBasedShippingData`, `RenderField`, `useMerchantConfigApi`).  Error handling is implemented to prevent saving duplicate rules.  The `useEffect` hook updates the `shippingPrices` state based on the fetched configuration.


## 11:38:34
The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `shippingBasedData.tsx`.  The changes primarily focus on refining the user interface and functionality related to product-based shipping rules within a merchant's configuration.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` underwent several updates between 10:40:41 and 11:17:10 on August 18, 2025.  The most significant change was the addition of a "title" prop to the Drawer component at 10:52:21, improving the user experience. Minor additions to the `onClose` handler of the Drawer component occurred at 10:52:46 and 10:52:46, resetting form fields and updating state.  A crucial modification to `handleFormSubmit` at 11:16:27 added a check to prevent errors when editing existing rules, enhancing error handling. The rest of the changes in this file are minor formatting changes.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` was updated once at 10:57:50 and again at 10:58:00 on August 18, 2025.  These updates involved a substantial restructuring of the `processProductBasedShippingData` function. This function handles data processing and UI elements for displaying and manipulating shipping rules.  The changes are primarily in the structure of the function and there was not any significant functional update between the two timestamps. The modifications seem to be about improving the data handling and display of product and collection information within the shipping rule settings.  The code added functionality for adding and deleting products and collections to shipping rules and improved UI through the use of tables and tags.


## 13:38:33
The log shows updates to two files related to product-based shipping settings within a checkout dashboard UI.  The most significant changes occurred between 12:40:28 and 12:40:39 on August 18, 2025, in `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`. This involved a minor code rearrangement within the `handleFormSubmit` function, specifically changing the order of `setItemsData([])`, `setModalOpen(false)`, and `form.resetFields()`.  The functionality remained the same.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` was updated at 12:41:17 on August 18, 2025. This update is more substantial and involves the `processProductBasedShippingData` function.  The changes include the addition of more detailed UI elements, specifically a more comprehensive table (`itemColumnData`) to manage products and collections associated with shipping rules.  The improved table provides functionalities like adding and deleting products/collections, using a `ProductSearch` component for easier selection.  Enhancements were also made to the form (`fields`) to handle rule creation, including more robust input validation and clearer labels. The update also refactors how product and collection data is handled and displayed within the UI.  A `deleteShipping` function was added to remove shipping rules directly from the data.  The overall effect is a more user-friendly and feature-rich interface for managing product-based shipping rules.  The repeated use of `form.setFieldValue` and related form handling functions highlights a consistent pattern of managing form state updates across multiple components.


## 15:38:32
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` between 14:45:36 and 14:47:02 on August 18, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor styling adjustments within the `ProductSearch` component's rendering. Specifically, the width of the `span` containing the `ProductSearch` components was changed from `w-40` to `w-44` and then some minor adjustments were made to the  `p` tag styling from `p` to `p-0` and `p-0 mr-1`.

A separate change was made to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` at 14:51:19 and again at 14:51:24 on August 18, 2025.  These revisions do not show any code changes.

# Activity Summary for 18/08/2025

## 00:43:03
The log shows modifications to two files within the `checkout-dashboard-ui` project.  The primary focus is on `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`, which underwent three revisions between 23:29:42 and 23:30:39 on August 17, 2025.  These changes primarily involved adjustments to the `Drawer` component's width, increasing it from 400 to 550.  The code itself remained largely consistent, focusing on product-based shipping rule management using a form, table, and drawer for data input and display.  The  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` file was updated once at 23:34:59 on the same day. This update involved substantial changes to the `processProductBasedShippingData` function. This function handles the processing and display of product-based shipping data, including adding, deleting, and manipulating product and collection IDs in the UI using a table, and form components.  The changes include improved handling of product variants, error messages for duplicate entries, and a more robust data structure for managing products and collections associated with shipping rules.  Both files heavily utilize the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library.

# Activity Summary for 20/08/2025

## 00:17:02
The provided log shows three entries for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts`, all on August 19, 2025.  The code in all three entries is identical.  The timestamps indicate that the file was either updated three times with the same content, or the timestamp is inaccurate. There are no discernible changes in the code between the three entries.  The code itself is a TypeScript file containing numerous asynchronous functions related to a merchant API, likely for a checkout process.  These functions handle various aspects including cart management (`getCartJs`, `getAbandonCart`, `updateCartAnalytics`), request ID generation (`getRequestId`), user experiments (`getUserExperiments`, `assignUserVariant`), authentication and OTP (`submitPhoneNumber`, `checkLogin`, `verifyOTP`, `resendOtpCall`), address management (`deleteAddress`, `verifyPincode`, `addAddress`, `getAllAddress`), and potentially other features. The functions extensively utilize various store subscriptions (using MobX or a similar state management library) from different stores (OrderStore, LoginStore, CommonStore) to access and update application state.  The consistent use of `postCall` and `getCall` suggests a standardized API interaction pattern.  Error handling appears minimal, primarily relying on `try...catch` blocks and Promise.any for jwtToken management in checkLogin. The code also includes custom handling for various parameters like `cf_user_customer_id`, `cf_user_id`, `cf_dimension_id`, and `cf_session_id`, likely for analytics or tracking purposes.  The presence of `x-gokwik-token` and `x-kwikpass-token` headers suggest API authentication mechanisms.

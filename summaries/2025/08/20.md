# Activity Summary for 20/08/2025

## 00:17:02
The provided log shows three entries for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts`, all on August 19, 2025.  The code in all three entries is identical.  The timestamps indicate that the file was either updated three times with the same content, or the timestamp is inaccurate. There are no discernible changes in the code between the three entries.  The code itself is a TypeScript file containing numerous asynchronous functions related to a merchant API, likely for a checkout process.  These functions handle various aspects including cart management (`getCartJs`, `getAbandonCart`, `updateCartAnalytics`), request ID generation (`getRequestId`), user experiments (`getUserExperiments`, `assignUserVariant`), authentication and OTP (`submitPhoneNumber`, `checkLogin`, `verifyOTP`, `resendOtpCall`), address management (`deleteAddress`, `verifyPincode`, `addAddress`, `getAllAddress`), and potentially other features. The functions extensively utilize various store subscriptions (using MobX or a similar state management library) from different stores (OrderStore, LoginStore, CommonStore) to access and update application state.  The consistent use of `postCall` and `getCall` suggests a standardized API interaction pattern.  Error handling appears minimal, primarily relying on `try...catch` blocks and Promise.any for jwtToken management in checkLogin. The code also includes custom handling for various parameters like `cf_user_customer_id`, `cf_user_id`, `cf_dimension_id`, and `cf_session_id`, likely for analytics or tracking purposes.  The presence of `x-gokwik-token` and `x-kwikpass-token` headers suggest API authentication mechanisms.

The log shows code changes on August 20, 2025, primarily focused on the `checkout-dashboard-ui` and `dashboard-ui-configuration` projects.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated at 12:06:33.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML based on the environment (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  The significant change is the conditional inclusion of `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` blocks. These blocks define import maps for different environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production), specifying URLs for various Gokwik modules (@gokwik/*).  The production environment also includes Clarity and New Relic tracking scripts, with a dynamically injected `clarityKey`. The import map specifies CDN locations for React, React-DOM, and single-spa.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file was modified at 12:09:44. This React component handles editing order details. Key updates include:

* Extensive use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.
*  Usage of Redux's `useSelector` hook to access application state (merchant details, user configuration, etc.).
* API calls are made using `makeAPICall` from `@gokwik/utilities`.
*  The component manages line items, allowing adding, modifying, and deleting them.  Quantity adjustments trigger `modifyQty` function calls.  Item deletion temporarily stores deleted items in `discount.recentlyDeletedItems`, allowing their re-addition.
*  Discount management is a prominent feature, with options for fixed amount or percentage discounts.  The UI allows adding and removing discounts, and provides feedback through messages.
*  Data is displayed in tables using the `Table` component, with custom rendering for product information and quantity controls.
*  Error handling is implemented using state variables for errors and error items.
* The component uses `single-spa`'s `navigateToUrl` for navigation.
* The component utilizes helper functions such as `formatAmount` and `removeDuplicatesByKey`.

The updates suggest a robust order management system with a focus on a clean, component-based UI and clear separation of concerns through the use of utility functions and Redux.  The conditional logic in `index.ejs` points to a multi-environment deployment strategy.

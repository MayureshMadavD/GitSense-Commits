# Activity Summary for 25/08/2025

## 22:52:36
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`  files between August 22nd and 25th, 2025.  There are also several updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` during August 25th, 2025.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`:** This file underwent multiple revisions within a short time frame on August 22nd, 2025 (13:10:52, 13:11:01, 13:11:24).  These changes seem to focus on handling incoming `'launch'` events through a `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` function. The code processes data received from an iframe, populating various Svelte stores (`store_sourceValue`, `store_localStorageObject`, `store_isGlanceEnvironment`, etc.) with information related to the checkout process, including cart details, user data, and environment variables.  A significant amount of error handling is present for various scenarios, such as empty carts and expired checkout links.  The later update on August 25th (19:57:40) refactors the `onpopstate` event handler for improved back button functionality, adding specific actions based on the current page and loading states.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`:** This file, also updated on August 22nd (13:12:04, 13:12:15) and August 25th (22:16:38, 22:17:16, 22:19:22, 22:19:29, 22:19:45, 22:22:17, 22:22:58, 22:24:36, 22:26:25, 22:41:22, 22:43:53, 22:57:35, 23:00:42, 23:01:31, 23:02:02, 23:02:37, 23:03:27, 23:03:34, 23:08:48), defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the current environment (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`).  The  `setCart()` and `setReqId()` functions are repeatedly modified, focusing on retrieving and setting cart data from localStorage.  The final versions  load cart data (`gk_cart_data`) from cookies and handle the case where the 'custom_form' cookie is set.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`:** This file, updated multiple times on August 25th (16:37:45, 16:42:50, 16:42:57, 16:44:27, 16:45:15, 16:46:31, 16:46:38, 16:50:13, 16:51:33, 16:52:27, 16:52:38, 16:53:11, 16:53:32, 16:54:47, 16:55:09, 16:55:18, 16:55:32, 22:17:59, 22:20:47, 22:27:51, 22:28:24, 22:29:20, 22:29:26, 22:31:56, 22:32:41, 22:32:59, 22:33:39, 22:33:47, 22:34:14, 22:34:54, 22:35:05, 22:36:10, 22:39:46, 22:41:56, 22:42:01, 22:42:26, 22:42:35, 22:48:23), represents the merchant's webpage. The changes involve adding a form for saving and loading data to/from cookies, using `getCookieGk` and `setCookieGk` functions.  The  `window.merchantInfo` object is consistently updated, primarily to reflect the 'local' environment and utilize cookies for storing `merchant_id` and `gk_cart_data`. The UI is also improved with styling and a more user friendly layout, and the button text is updated to be more descriptive.


The overall pattern in these code changes points to a focus on local environment setup, improved error handling, and enhanced user interaction for the Gokwik checkout integration. The repeated modifications to cart data handling, particularly in `EnvironmentService`, suggest ongoing development and debugging of this feature. The `merchant.html` file shows a transition from a simple button to a more complex UI for managing data related to the checkout process.  The development seems to shift from localStorage to Cookie storage in the later stages.

# Activity Summary for 06/08/2025

## 14:15:56
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project, primarily focused on the `EnvironmentService.ts` file and `merchant.html` file.

The `EnvironmentService.ts` file underwent several revisions between 12:08:53 and 12:19:09 on June 8th, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved modifications to the logic determining base URLs for various APIs (e.g., `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`) based on the current environment (`env`).  The changes involve adding, removing, or altering URLs for different environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  A notable change is the handling of the 'local' environment within the `api_url` function, where the default URL switches from `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` to  `https://qa-core-api.dev.gokwik.in` between revisions. The `setCart()` function also shows a change in the `cartjsObject` data.  The most significant change is the addition of more detailed information and the change of token in the cart object.


The `merchant.html` file was updated at 12:18:38 on June 8th, 2025. This update involves changes to the client-side JavaScript code handling the Gokwik SDK initialization and communication with the parent window.  It includes setting cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), handling postMessage events,  and defining  `merchantInfo` object which seems to specify merchant details (mid, environment, etc.). The commented-out analytics script suggests a possible removal or change in the analytics implementation strategy.  The code also includes a button with hardcoded `mid`, `appid`, and `appsecret` attributes, which might be security concern and should be reviewed.

In summary, the code changes reflect adjustments to API endpoints and environmental configurations, along with client-side improvements concerning the Gokwik SDK integration and  merchant information handling.  The frequent updates to `EnvironmentService.ts` suggest ongoing development and testing across various environments.  The inclusion of `merchantInfo` with potentially sensitive data in `merchant.html` highlights the need for a thorough security review.

The log shows code changes across several files within a checkout dashboard UI project.  The primary focus is on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` file which underwent a significant update at 06/08/2025, 11:32:50.  This file defines numerous TypeScript interfaces encompassing various data structures related to orders, line items, discounts, transactions, cart items, shipping, and store credits. These interfaces are comprehensive, suggesting a robust data model for the application.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/integration-settings/giftCardVouchers.tsx` file was updated twice, at 06/08/2025, 11:32:56 and 06/08/2025, 11:33:31. These changes involve a React component responsible for managing gift card and voucher integration settings. The component interacts with Redux store selectors (`selectMerchantCreds`, `selectMerchantRewards`) and actions (`saveCreds`, `saveRewards`) to handle configuration changes. There's a significant amount of logic for managing the enablement and customization of different gift card providers (Shopify, Qwickcilver, Gyftr), including interdependencies and error handling. The second update seems to be a minor correction, possibly related to initial form values on load.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated multiple times (06/08/2025, 11:47:37, 06/08/2025, 12:15:50, and 06/08/2025, 13:30:01). This file is an EJS template that generates HTML for the dashboard UI configuration. The updates appear to be related to configuring import maps for different environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The URLs point to various backend services for different environments; a clear pattern is established for consistent environment-specific URLs.  Production also contains some New Relic and Clarity analytics code additions.  The changes across multiple timestamps suggest iterative adjustments to the import map configurations and integration of analytics.

Finally, the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file was updated on 06/08/2025, 13:40:12. This file contains a React component for editing order details. It utilizes `gokwik-ui-kit` components for the UI, Redux for state management, and custom utility functions for API calls and data formatting.  The component handles the update of order line items, discounts, shipping addresses, and maintains state for various UI elements (modals, drawers).  The code is complex and highly interactive, reflecting a sophisticated order management feature.

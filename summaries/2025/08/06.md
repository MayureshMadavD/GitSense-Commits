# Activity Summary for 06/08/2025

## 14:15:56
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project, primarily focused on the `EnvironmentService.ts` file and `merchant.html` file.

The `EnvironmentService.ts` file underwent several revisions between 12:08:53 and 12:19:09 on June 8th, 2025.  These revisions primarily involved modifications to the logic determining base URLs for various APIs (e.g., `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`) based on the current environment (`env`).  The changes involve adding, removing, or altering URLs for different environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  A notable change is the handling of the 'local' environment within the `api_url` function, where the default URL switches from `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` to  `https://qa-core-api.dev.gokwik.in` between revisions. The `setCart()` function also shows a change in the `cartjsObject` data.  The most significant change is the addition of more detailed information and the change of token in the cart object.


The `merchant.html` file was updated at 12:18:38 on June 8th, 2025. This update involves changes to the client-side JavaScript code handling the Gokwik SDK initialization and communication with the parent window.  It includes setting cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), handling postMessage events,  and defining  `merchantInfo` object which seems to specify merchant details (mid, environment, etc.). The commented-out analytics script suggests a possible removal or change in the analytics implementation strategy.  The code also includes a button with hardcoded `mid`, `appid`, and `appsecret` attributes, which might be security concern and should be reviewed.

In summary, the code changes reflect adjustments to API endpoints and environmental configurations, along with client-side improvements concerning the Gokwik SDK integration and  merchant information handling.  The frequent updates to `EnvironmentService.ts` suggest ongoing development and testing across various environments.  The inclusion of `merchantInfo` with potentially sensitive data in `merchant.html` highlights the need for a thorough security review.

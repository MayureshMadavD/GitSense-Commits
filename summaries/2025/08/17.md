## 14:26:38
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` between 13:49 and 14:24 on August 17, 2025.

The `shippingBasedData.tsx` file primarily focuses on fetching and displaying data related to product-based shipping rules.  Changes include:

* **Initial Version (13:49:28):**  The initial commit defines functions to fetch and structure product-based shipping column data for a table. This includes defining the table data (`tableData`), columns (`columns`), and form fields (`fields`).  The `ProductSearch` component is used to select products and collections.

* **State Management Added (13:52:28 - 13:57:07):**  Subsequent commits introduce a React `useState` hook (`itemsData`) to manage the state of selected products and collections within the `ProductSearch` component, improving data flow and UI updates.  A series of minor changes refine the `onAdd` function in `ProductSearch` to correctly update the state.  There's also a logging addition to debug data flow.

* **State Removal and Simplification (13:59:29 - 14:02:44):** The `useState` hook  in `shippingBasedData.tsx` is removed, simplifying the component.  The focus shifts to direct form updates via `form.setFieldValue`.

* **State Restored and Refined (14:04:42 - 14:08:03):** The `useState` hook  is reintroduced to manage product data.  Minor adjustments and console.logs further refine debugging and state updates.


* **Form Value Logging (14:06:34 - 14:07:53):** Logging statements are added to print form values and the selected product data to assist with debugging.


* **Minor UI Tweaks (14:18:49):** The `ProductSearch` component's width is adjusted within the  `shippingBasedData.tsx` file. A commented-out `ProductSearch` component for collections is observed.


The `productSearch.tsx` file underwent significant changes between 14:08 and 14:24. It's a reusable component for searching and selecting products or collections. Key revisions include:

* **Initial Version (14:08:20):** The initial commit defines the `ProductSearch` component with functionality to fetch data via `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`, handle pagination, display results, and allow users to add or remove items.  The UI heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The component handles both products and collections. A debounce function prevents excessive API calls.

* **Refactoring and UI Improvements (14:15:20 - 14:24:03):**  These commits focus on  refactoring and UI/UX improvements. Changes involve handling edge cases (empty search results), conditional rendering based on search type and collateProducts prop, and adjusting placeholder text for a more user-friendly experience.  There's also a minor error correction in image source handling and the addition of a data prop for the `products` parameter.  A conditional check is added in the rendering to ensure data is present before mapping.


In summary, the majority of the changes involve refining state management within the `shippingBasedData` component, improving data handling between `shippingBasedData` and `productSearch` component, refining the functionality and user experience of the `productSearch` component, and adding debugging statements. The overall goal appears to be to create a robust and efficient UI for managing product-based shipping rules.

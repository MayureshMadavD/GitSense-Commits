# Activity Summary for 17/08/2025

## 14:26:38
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` between 13:49 and 14:24 on August 17, 2025.

The `shippingBasedData.tsx` file primarily focuses on fetching and displaying data related to product-based shipping rules.  Changes include:

* **Initial Version (13:49:28):**  The initial commit defines functions to fetch and structure product-based shipping column data for a table. This includes defining the table data (`tableData`), columns (`columns`), and form fields (`fields`).  The `ProductSearch` component is used to select products and collections.

* **State Management Added (13:52:28 - 13:57:07):**  Subsequent commits introduce a React `useState` hook (`itemsData`) to manage the state of selected products and collections within the `ProductSearch` component, improving data flow and UI updates.  A series of minor changes refine the `onAdd` function in `ProductSearch` to correctly update the state.  There's also a logging addition to debug data flow.

* **State Removal and Simplification (13:59:29 - 14:02:44):** The `useState` hook  in `shippingBasedData.tsx` is removed, simplifying the component.  The focus shifts to direct form updates via `form.setFieldValue`.

* **State Restored and Refined (14:04:42 - 14:08:03):** The `useState` hook  is reintroduced to manage product data.  Minor adjustments and console.logs further refine debugging and state updates.


* **Form Value Logging (14:06:34 - 14:07:53):** Logging statements are added to print form values and the selected product data to assist with debugging.


* **Minor UI Tweaks (14:18:49):** The `ProductSearch` component's width is adjusted within the  `shippingBasedData.tsx` file. A commented-out `ProductSearch` component for collections is observed.


The `productSearch.tsx` file underwent significant changes between 14:08 and 14:24. It's a reusable component for searching and selecting products or collections. Key revisions include:

* **Initial Version (14:08:20):** The initial commit defines the `ProductSearch` component with functionality to fetch data via `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`, handle pagination, display results, and allow users to add or remove items.  The UI heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The component handles both products and collections. A debounce function prevents excessive API calls.

* **Refactoring and UI Improvements (14:15:20 - 14:24:03):**  These commits focus on  refactoring and UI/UX improvements. Changes involve handling edge cases (empty search results), conditional rendering based on search type and collateProducts prop, and adjusting placeholder text for a more user-friendly experience.  There's also a minor error correction in image source handling and the addition of a data prop for the `products` parameter.  A conditional check is added in the rendering to ensure data is present before mapping.


In summary, the majority of the changes involve refining state management within the `shippingBasedData` component, improving data handling between `shippingBasedData` and `productSearch` component, refining the functionality and user experience of the `productSearch` component, and adding debugging statements. The overall goal appears to be to create a robust and efficient UI for managing product-based shipping rules.


## 15:26:28
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` between 14:27 and 15:25 on August 17, 2025.  The main focus of these changes centers around improving the display and management of product-based shipping rules within a React component.

Initially, the code lacked a state mechanism for managing added products.  Between 14:27 and 14:34, several attempts were made to integrate `Form.useWatch` from a `Form` component (likely a form library like React Hook Form or similar) to manage this state. This proved unsuccessful, and the approach shifted to using `useState` to manage `products` and `collection` data.

A significant change occurred around 15:16, where a section was added to render a list of added products, including product name, thumbnail, variant information, and quantity.  This involved adding imports for `CloseOutlined` and `ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage`, suggesting a more visual representation of selected products within the form.  Subsequent edits (15:17-15:25) refined the display of this product list, simplifying the display of variant information and improving the overall UI by removing unnecessary data.  There's also a consistent effort to refine the styling, using classes like `w-full`, `flex`, `justify-between`, `p-2`, `bg-gray-50`, etc., indicating use of a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.  The `onRemove` function remains largely unchanged, primarily logging the removed product rather than implementing any actual removal logic within this component (this may be handled elsewhere).  A redundant field was removed at around 14:38.

Throughout the revisions, the core structure of the component—`tableData`, `columns`, and `fields`—remained consistent, indicating a focus on enhancing the user interface and product data management within the existing framework. The `ProductSearch` component was repeatedly used for adding products and collections, demonstrating a modular approach to the component design.


## 16:26:35
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`.  The file is a React component responsible for fetching and displaying product-based shipping data.  The majority of changes revolve around refining the display of added products and collections using a `Table` component from the `gokwik-ui-kit`.

Initially, the component rendered product information within custom `div` elements. Between  17/08/2025, 15:26:30 and 17/08/2025, 16:12:28, the code underwent significant restructuring. A `Table` component was introduced to manage the display of added items.  The `itemsData` state variable, initially an object, changed to an array to accommodate the `Table`'s `dataSource` prop.

The `itemColumnData` was introduced to define table columns, including image, product name, type, and action.  The `render` props were added to several `itemColumnData` elements to customize cell rendering, particularly for displaying images and IDs.  The timestamp for the introduction of this Table component is 17/08/2025, 16:12:28.

Between 17/08/2025, 15:50:44 and 17/08/2025, 16:04:54, updates improved handling of added products and collections data in the `ProductSearch` components' `onAdd` handlers.  These changes included consolidating data mapping within the `onAdd` functions, adding a `type` field ('product' or 'collection') to the added item data, and directly updating `itemsData` state. The change of  `itemsData` to an array and its usage within the `Table` was completed by 17/08/2025, 16:22:43.

Finally, minor adjustments to styling (`flex flex-col`) and the conditional rendering of the `Table` based on `itemsData` length were performed between 17/08/2025, 16:17:05 and 17/08/2025, 16:22:43.  The consistent use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components is a recurring pattern throughout the code.  The  `id` field in the `itemColumnData`'s `render` function was refined to only extract numeric IDs using  `replace(/^\D+/g, '')` around 17/08/2025, 16:18:59.


## 17:26:32
The log shows a single file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` undergoing multiple revisions between 16:27:08 and 17:25:20 on August 17, 2025.  The main focus of the changes is the `fetchProductBasedShippingColumnData` function, which appears to handle data related to product-based shipping rules.

The initial version lacked error handling for adding duplicate products or collections.  Subsequent revisions (16:34:48, 16:34:55) added this functionality, using `message.error` from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library to display error messages to the user if a similar product or collection is already present. A `console.log` statement was also temporarily added (16:38:53, 16:40:43) and later removed for debugging purposes.  

Another significant change (16:36:03) involved adding a `CloseOutlined` icon to the `itemColumnData` for removing items, enhancing user interaction. A minor change around 16:44:51 updated "Product Name" to "Title" in the `itemColumnData`.  At 16:48:02 a `console.log` statement was added to log the shipping data itself for debugging, which was likely removed later, as the changes around 16:58:39 shows the removal of this statement.

The change at 16:58:39 improved the code's robustness by using the `in` operator to check for the existence of the `product_based_rules` key in the `shipping` object, preventing potential errors.  A similar enhancement was made around 17:00:41, ensuring an empty array is returned if 'product_based_rules' is not present. Another update improved the id handling in the `itemColumnData` function.  Further refinements between 17:05:35 and 17:07:14 focused on consistently handling IDs, removing the `replace(/^\D+/g, '')` in certain sections and added `collateProducts` prop to the `ProductSearch` component.

Finally, the most substantial change occurred between 17:20:37 and 17:25:20, modifying the `onAdd` function in the `ProductSearch` component to handle product variants using `data.variants` and improving the error handling and logic for preventing duplicate entries of product variants. The error message was also updated to reflect that product *variants* are checked, not just products.  This modification suggests a move towards more granular control over product selection.  The `variants` field was also added to the `mappedData` array in this final revision.


## 18:26:34
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` file underwent significant revisions between 17/08/2025, 17:26:51 and 17:57:50.  The primary change was a rename of the exported function from `fetchProductBasedShippingColumnData` to `processProductBasedShippingData`. This function processes and displays product-based shipping data.  The core functionality remained consistent: it takes shipping data and a form object as input. It prepares data for display in a table (`tableData`, `columns`) and defines fields for a form (`fields`).

Early changes (17:26:51 - 17:31:51) focused on refining the `onAdd` function within the `ProductSearch` component, specifically adjusting how product variant IDs are handled and processed to prevent duplicates.  The initial attempts involved nested `map` functions and then `forEach` before settling on `flatMap`.

A notable change at 17:43:44 involved adding a 'Variant Selected' column to the table, displaying the number of variants selected for each product or collection.  Further modifications (17:44:45 - 17:48:18) improved the delete button functionality within the table by using the `DeleteFilled` component from the 'gokwik-ui-kit' library and refining its styling and functionality.  The button was initially styled with `bg-red-500`  but was then changed to `text-red-500` at 17:47:45.

The most substantial changes occurred at 17:56:59. The `DeleteFilled` component was replaced by a `Button` with a `DeleteFilled` icon, allowing for better integration with the UI framework. The `onClick` handler now intends to remove items from `itemsData` state.  However, the initial implementations of this `onClick` handler were flawed, failing to correctly remove items from the state. This was improved over several commits (18:00:22, 18:01:11, 18:03:01, 18:03:22) until the correct `filter` method was used at 18:03:22 to remove the item by id.

Finally, an `useEffect` hook was added at 18:05:06 to log the `itemsData` state and the form's values for debugging purposes; this hook shows the state change and form values on each change of the itemsData state.  At 18:10:01, the `onClick` handler was updated to attempt using the form's `setFieldValue` method to remove the item. The final commit at 18:25:40 attempted to use a `symmetricDifference` function to update the `productIds` field in the form.

Throughout the log, there is a consistent pattern of improving the handling of product and collection data within the form, and optimizing the user interface for deleting items from the table. The use of `form.getFieldValue` and `form.setFieldValue` suggests the use of a form management library like React Hook Form.


## 19:29:12
The log shows three revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`, all within a short time frame (17/08/2025, between 18:28:28 and 18:31:27).  The changes primarily focus on the `itemColumnData` array within the `processProductBasedShippingData` function.

The first two revisions are nearly identical, with a minor difference: the `map` function within the `onClick` handler of the delete button in `itemColumnData` changes its `map` function from mapping strings to numbers (`Number()`). This suggests a bug fix related to data type handling for product variants.

The third revision contains the most significant change. The `onClick` handler in the `itemColumnData`'s delete button is substantially altered.  Instead of simply removing an item from `itemsData`, it now intelligently updates the `product_ids` or `collection_ids` in the form's state based on whether the deleted item is a product or a collection.  This improves data consistency between the displayed items and the form data.  The `filteredProductId` calculation is also improved to ensure proper removal of items from the form's state in the case of products.  The logic for removing collections is completely added in this revision.  This indicates a significant improvement in the delete functionality, ensuring data integrity.  The overall structure and function of the component remains consistent across the revisions.


## 20:29:16
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`  and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` between 19:51:15 and 20:28:34 on August 17, 2025.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` file underwent several revisions, primarily focused on refining the handling of product and collection IDs within a form.  Early revisions involved debugging using `console.log` statements to track `itemsData` and form field values.  Subsequent changes focused on improving the logic for adding products and collections, preventing duplicates, and ensuring correct updates to the form's `product_based_rules` fields using `form.setFieldValue`. A notable change was introduced at 20:13:43, where the `onAdd` function for product searches was enhanced to handle duplicate product variants by updating existing entries instead of adding duplicates.  The `useEffect` hook was removed at 20:21:19.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` file received minor updates. Initially, the `Save` button lacked functionality.  This was addressed around 20:26:02 by adding an `onClick` handler to trigger form submission using `form.submit()`. A further modification at 20:28:34 added `console.log` statements within `handleFormSubmit` to output `shippingPrices` and form values.  This suggests debugging or logging improvements to observe data flow.  The overall structure of the component remained unchanged, focused on rendering a form and a table using data processed by `shippingBasedData.tsx`.


## 21:29:13
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` files between 20:41:17 and 21:25:44 on August 17, 2025.

The primary focus of the changes is on the `productBasaedShipping.tsx` component, which appears to be a React component for managing product-based shipping rules.  Initially, the `handleFormSubmit` function contained debugging `console.log` statements which were subsequently removed or modified.  A significant change occurred around 21:12:11, where error handling was added using `message.error` to prevent submission if a rule already exists for the selected shipping method.  Further refinements to `handleFormSubmit` continued until 21:25:44, where the final version updates the `targetedShipping` object with the new `formValues` while ensuring the `shipping_id` is not included in the update and logging only `shippingPrices`.


The `shippingBasedData.tsx` file was modified only once (at 21:06:17). This file contains a function `processProductBasedShippingData` that processes shipping data and returns data for a table and form fields.  This function utilizes a `ProductSearch` component and handles adding and removing products and collections from the shipping rules. The addition of the delete functionality adds a delete button to the items table.


The pattern in the `productBasaedShipping.tsx` changes demonstrates an iterative debugging and refinement process, with the initial version containing extra console logs, followed by gradual removal of unnecessary logging and enhancements to error handling and data manipulation within the `handleFormSubmit` function.  The component relies heavily on the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and uses custom hooks like `useMerchantConfigApi` for data fetching and saving.


## 22:29:18
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`.  The changes span from 21:29:36 to 22:26:25 on August 17, 2025.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` underwent several revisions, primarily focused on the `handleFormSubmit` function.  Initially, this function lacked the `saveConfig` call, which was added around 21:33:01 to persist changes. Subsequent changes to `saveConfig`'s argument (21:35:59) corrected how the `shippingPrices` array was handled. Finally, `form.resetFields()` was added at 21:37:34 to clear the form after submission.  A later change at 22:10:11 added `saveConfig` as a parameter to `processProductBasedShippingData`.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`  experienced more substantial changes over time. The most significant changes involved the `columns` array within the `processProductBasedShippingData` function.  Initially, this array did not contain an 'Action' column. This column was added around 22:05:27, initially with `EditOutlined` and `DeleteFilled` icons. This was refined further (22:18:29 - 22:26:25), integrating a `Dropdown` component to provide a more sophisticated action menu with "Edit" and "Delete" options, improving the user interface for managing shipping rules.  The changes in this file also involved updates to handle product and collection additions and removals, ensuring data consistency within the form and UI.  The addition of `saveConfig` as a parameter occurred at 22:11:42.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative development, improving the functionality and user experience of a product-based shipping configuration interface.  The updates to `shippingBasedData.tsx` focused on enhancing the UI, while the changes in `productBasaedShipping.tsx` were mainly about implementing proper data persistence and form management. The major changes to both files clustered around 22:05:27 and 22:26:25, indicating significant refactoring and UI improvements in the later stages.


## 23:29:18
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` and one to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` between 22:30 and 23:27 on August 17, 2025.

The primary focus of the changes is on the `shippingBasedData.tsx` component, which handles product-based shipping data.  The revisions primarily involve refinements to the UI components (using `gokwik-ui-kit` library), specifically a Table component displaying product and collection information, and the addition of functionality allowing users to add products and collections to shipping rules via `ProductSearch` components.  The `DeleteFilled` component is used for deleting items from the table.  There is also manipulation of form data using `form.setFieldValue` and `form.getFieldValue` to update product and collection IDs. The `saveConfig` function is repeatedly used to persist changes.


Between 22:30 and 22:35, several minor revisions were made to `shippingBasedData.tsx`, likely involving minor UI adjustments like the placement and styling of a Dropdown menu (`placement` attribute changes from `bottomLeft` to `bottomRight` and addition of `cursor-pointer` class and a `mb-2` class to Button).


Between 22:38 and 23:27,  significant changes occurred in `shippingBasedData.tsx`. These changes involved adding a `deleteShipping` function to handle the deletion of shipping rules from the data. The function identifies the target shipping data based on `shipping_uuid` and removes the `product_based_rules` property.  Furthermore, the component's structure was altered to incorporate a Drawer component (`gokwik-ui-kit`) for managing shipping rule configuration and uses `RenderField` to render form fields.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` file was modified to integrate the updated `shippingBasedData.tsx` component.  Key changes include updates to the Drawer's size (`size='large'` then `size='default'`), ensuring that the Drawer is correctly closed on form reset and improved rendering of form fields within the Drawer using  `key={field.id}`.  Error handling for duplicate rule definitions was also implemented.

In summary, the code evolution centers around enhancing the UI and functionality of product-based shipping rule management. The changes demonstrate an iterative development process, with minor UI tweaks followed by substantial additions of delete functionality and improved Drawer implementation for a better user experience.

# Activity Summary for 17/08/2025

## 14:26:38
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` between 13:49 and 14:24 on August 17, 2025.

The `shippingBasedData.tsx` file primarily focuses on fetching and displaying data related to product-based shipping rules.  Changes include:

* **Initial Version (13:49:28):**  The initial commit defines functions to fetch and structure product-based shipping column data for a table. This includes defining the table data (`tableData`), columns (`columns`), and form fields (`fields`).  The `ProductSearch` component is used to select products and collections.

* **State Management Added (13:52:28 - 13:57:07):**  Subsequent commits introduce a React `useState` hook (`itemsData`) to manage the state of selected products and collections within the `ProductSearch` component, improving data flow and UI updates.  A series of minor changes refine the `onAdd` function in `ProductSearch` to correctly update the state.  There's also a logging addition to debug data flow.

* **State Removal and Simplification (13:59:29 - 14:02:44):** The `useState` hook  in `shippingBasedData.tsx` is removed, simplifying the component.  The focus shifts to direct form updates via `form.setFieldValue`.

* **State Restored and Refined (14:04:42 - 14:08:03):** The `useState` hook  is reintroduced to manage product data.  Minor adjustments and console.logs further refine debugging and state updates.


* **Form Value Logging (14:06:34 - 14:07:53):** Logging statements are added to print form values and the selected product data to assist with debugging.


* **Minor UI Tweaks (14:18:49):** The `ProductSearch` component's width is adjusted within the  `shippingBasedData.tsx` file. A commented-out `ProductSearch` component for collections is observed.


The `productSearch.tsx` file underwent significant changes between 14:08 and 14:24. It's a reusable component for searching and selecting products or collections. Key revisions include:

* **Initial Version (14:08:20):** The initial commit defines the `ProductSearch` component with functionality to fetch data via `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`, handle pagination, display results, and allow users to add or remove items.  The UI heavily utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The component handles both products and collections. A debounce function prevents excessive API calls.

* **Refactoring and UI Improvements (14:15:20 - 14:24:03):**  These commits focus on  refactoring and UI/UX improvements. Changes involve handling edge cases (empty search results), conditional rendering based on search type and collateProducts prop, and adjusting placeholder text for a more user-friendly experience.  There's also a minor error correction in image source handling and the addition of a data prop for the `products` parameter.  A conditional check is added in the rendering to ensure data is present before mapping.


In summary, the majority of the changes involve refining state management within the `shippingBasedData` component, improving data handling between `shippingBasedData` and `productSearch` component, refining the functionality and user experience of the `productSearch` component, and adding debugging statements. The overall goal appears to be to create a robust and efficient UI for managing product-based shipping rules.


## 15:26:28
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` between 14:27 and 15:25 on August 17, 2025.  The main focus of these changes centers around improving the display and management of product-based shipping rules within a React component.

Initially, the code lacked a state mechanism for managing added products.  Between 14:27 and 14:34, several attempts were made to integrate `Form.useWatch` from a `Form` component (likely a form library like React Hook Form or similar) to manage this state. This proved unsuccessful, and the approach shifted to using `useState` to manage `products` and `collection` data.

A significant change occurred around 15:16, where a section was added to render a list of added products, including product name, thumbnail, variant information, and quantity.  This involved adding imports for `CloseOutlined` and `ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage`, suggesting a more visual representation of selected products within the form.  Subsequent edits (15:17-15:25) refined the display of this product list, simplifying the display of variant information and improving the overall UI by removing unnecessary data.  There's also a consistent effort to refine the styling, using classes like `w-full`, `flex`, `justify-between`, `p-2`, `bg-gray-50`, etc., indicating use of a CSS framework like Tailwind CSS.  The `onRemove` function remains largely unchanged, primarily logging the removed product rather than implementing any actual removal logic within this component (this may be handled elsewhere).  A redundant field was removed at around 14:38.

Throughout the revisions, the core structure of the component—`tableData`, `columns`, and `fields`—remained consistent, indicating a focus on enhancing the user interface and product data management within the existing framework. The `ProductSearch` component was repeatedly used for adding products and collections, demonstrating a modular approach to the component design.


## 16:26:35
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`.  The file is a React component responsible for fetching and displaying product-based shipping data.  The majority of changes revolve around refining the display of added products and collections using a `Table` component from the `gokwik-ui-kit`.

Initially, the component rendered product information within custom `div` elements. Between  17/08/2025, 15:26:30 and 17/08/2025, 16:12:28, the code underwent significant restructuring. A `Table` component was introduced to manage the display of added items.  The `itemsData` state variable, initially an object, changed to an array to accommodate the `Table`'s `dataSource` prop.

The `itemColumnData` was introduced to define table columns, including image, product name, type, and action.  The `render` props were added to several `itemColumnData` elements to customize cell rendering, particularly for displaying images and IDs.  The timestamp for the introduction of this Table component is 17/08/2025, 16:12:28.

Between 17/08/2025, 15:50:44 and 17/08/2025, 16:04:54, updates improved handling of added products and collections data in the `ProductSearch` components' `onAdd` handlers.  These changes included consolidating data mapping within the `onAdd` functions, adding a `type` field ('product' or 'collection') to the added item data, and directly updating `itemsData` state. The change of  `itemsData` to an array and its usage within the `Table` was completed by 17/08/2025, 16:22:43.

Finally, minor adjustments to styling (`flex flex-col`) and the conditional rendering of the `Table` based on `itemsData` length were performed between 17/08/2025, 16:17:05 and 17/08/2025, 16:22:43.  The consistent use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components is a recurring pattern throughout the code.  The  `id` field in the `itemColumnData`'s `render` function was refined to only extract numeric IDs using  `replace(/^\D+/g, '')` around 17/08/2025, 16:18:59.

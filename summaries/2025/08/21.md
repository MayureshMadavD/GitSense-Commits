The log shows code changes on August 21, 2025, to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx` (12:21:39): This file contains a React component `RenderForm` responsible for rendering a form.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components and `react-redux` for state management.  Significant updates include the addition of numerous tooltip components to clarify input fields related to loyalty programs (e.g.,  `MaxRedeemableEasyRewardsTooltip`),  and extensive form elements for configuring loyalty point settings (including switches, inputs, and select elements).  The code manages various configurations, including COD with loyalty, stacking discounts, auto-application of credits, and loyalty point display names.  It also includes alert messages related to EDD and pincode serviceability setup.  The use of several helper functions (`titleCase`, `navigateToUrl`) and imports from `@library/utilities` and `@store/user` suggest a well-integrated component within a larger application.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` (12:25:15): This file contains a React component `editAbcCart` for editing abandoned carts.  It uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components, `react-redux`, and custom hooks (`useMerchantConfigApi`). It makes API calls using  `makeAPICall` to fetch and update customer and order details, utilizing endpoints from `@library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints`.  The component handles various aspects of order management, including fetching customer details, addresses, handling different payment methods (COD, payment links, etc.), applying discounts, and order creation (`createOrder`). State management is extensive, using `useState` to track various aspects of the abandoned cart and the editing process (customer information, shipping, payment, etc.).  Error handling is evident through `try-catch` blocks and error messages. The use of  `useParams` and `useLocation` indicates the component is integrated into a routing system.  The component's significant functionality points to a key role in managing abandoned carts within the e-commerce application.

## 15:19:30
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` file on August 21st, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be refining the conditional rendering of a sales channel selector.

Initially, the sales channel selector was conditionally rendered based on the `config.enhancer_app` property.  Subsequent commits changed this conditional rendering to depend on both `merchantDetails.platform` being 'shopify' and `checkoutPlatform` being 'checkout_1'. This suggests a move towards more granular control over the visibility of the sales channel selector, potentially based on the specific checkout platform and merchant type.  The final version uses a ternary operator for a cleaner conditional rendering of this element.

Several commits between 14:59:20 and 15:07:42 involved adding `console.log` statements to debug the values of `config`, `checkoutPlatformKeys`, and `checkoutPlatform`. These were likely used to troubleshoot the conditional rendering logic.  These logging statements were subsequently removed in the last commit.  There were no significant changes to other aspects of the code, such as the date range picker functionality or the segmented control for screen selection.  The `logEvent` function consistently logs analytics data, indicating a focus on tracking user interactions.

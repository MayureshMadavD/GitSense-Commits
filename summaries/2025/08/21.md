## 13:19:30
The log shows code changes on August 21, 2025, to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx` (12:21:39): This file contains a React component `RenderForm` responsible for rendering a form.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components and `react-redux` for state management.  Significant updates include the addition of numerous tooltip components to clarify input fields related to loyalty programs (e.g.,  `MaxRedeemableEasyRewardsTooltip`),  and extensive form elements for configuring loyalty point settings (including switches, inputs, and select elements).  The code manages various configurations, including COD with loyalty, stacking discounts, auto-application of credits, and loyalty point display names.  It also includes alert messages related to EDD and pincode serviceability setup.  The use of several helper functions (`titleCase`, `navigateToUrl`) and imports from `@library/utilities` and `@store/user` suggest a well-integrated component within a larger application.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` (12:25:15): This file contains a React component `editAbcCart` for editing abandoned carts.  It uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components, `react-redux`, and custom hooks (`useMerchantConfigApi`). It makes API calls using  `makeAPICall` to fetch and update customer and order details, utilizing endpoints from `@library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints`.  The component handles various aspects of order management, including fetching customer details, addresses, handling different payment methods (COD, payment links, etc.), applying discounts, and order creation (`createOrder`). State management is extensive, using `useState` to track various aspects of the abandoned cart and the editing process (customer information, shipping, payment, etc.).  Error handling is evident through `try-catch` blocks and error messages. The use of  `useParams` and `useLocation` indicates the component is integrated into a routing system.  The component's significant functionality points to a key role in managing abandoned carts within the e-commerce application.

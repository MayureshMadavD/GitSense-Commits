# Activity Summary for 08/08/2025

## 10:59:37
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` throughout the day of July 8th, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor refinements and bug fixes, as the core functionality remains consistent across all revisions. There are no substantial structural changes to the code.  The timestamps indicate a period of intense development activity between 12:32 PM and 12:57 PM.

The Svelte component heavily relies on numerous stores from `../../common/stores/LoginStore` and `../../common/stores/CommonStore`, managing various aspects of user address, login status, and checkout flow.  The code repeatedly manipulates `addressInputs` and `addressFields` arrays, dynamically adding or removing fields based on conditional logic involving `$store_enableRecipientPhone`, `addressMMIFlow`, and `$store_additionalAddress`.  These conditions likely adapt the address form based on user context (e.g., billing vs. shipping addresses, optional fields, address suggestion flow).

The component also includes extensive analytics tracking using `fireGtmEvent` and `logEvent`, suggesting a focus on monitoring user interactions within the address input section.  The `onMount` function sets up several subscriptions to these stores and performs actions like setting focus and dispatching events. The `onDestroy` function cleans up the subscriptions and resets relevant store values.  The `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` lifecycle functions handle conditional logic for dynamically adjusting the displayed address fields.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Helper.service.ts` file, updated at 07/08/2025, 21:32:32, contains utility functions for interacting with various stores related to order management, including those responsible for estimated delivery date, order status, payment status, and bottom sheet management. It also includes functions related to address autofill detection and logging autofill events.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/localFileServices.ts` file, updated at 07/08/2025, 21:33:18, defines functions for generating base URLs for different APIs based on the environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`). The code also contains functions to set up initial values for cart data and request IDs and has functions related to generating URLs for different services.  It dynamically chooses the appropriate base URL based on the `env` variable, obtained from a store. The file also includes functions that return different types of tokens based on the environment,  `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken`.  These tokens are likely used for authentication and authorization.


The `.gitignore` file lists files and directories to be excluded from version control, including standard directories like `node_modules` and build artifacts. Notably, it excludes `./src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, indicating this file likely contains sensitive configuration data.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/integration-settings/loyaltyPoints.tsx` was updated on 08/08/2025 at 14:22:42.  This component renders a settings page for integrating various loyalty point providers (Pop Coins, Nector Coins, Flits, Yotpo, Credit Yard, Easy Rewards, Xeno).  It uses a `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and interacts with a Redux store (`@store/integrations`) for saving credentials.

The key functionality includes:

* **Toggling Loyalty Providers:** Users can enable/disable loyalty providers via switches.  Only one provider can be active at a time.  Enabling a provider with customization options opens a drawer for configuring settings.

* **Customization Drawer:** A drawer displays a customizable form (`RenderForm`) specific to the selected provider.  This form allows for various settings adjustments depending on the provider.  Special handling exists for 'nector', including JSON manipulation of `TransactionMetaDataToUpdateOrder`.  'flits' and 'nector' have specific data type conversions within the save function.

* **Data Handling:** The component uses `useMerchantConfigApi` to fetch and save configuration.  It employs `deepEqualAndDiff` for efficient comparison of configurations before saving changes. Error handling is present to display messages to the user. The component also handles different data types and structures depending on which loyalty provider is selected.

* **Form Management:**  The component uses `Form.useForm` from `gokwik-ui-kit` for managing the form state.  It populates the form with existing credentials from the Redux store and handles saving changes.  The save function includes numerous checks and transformations to properly format data based on selected provider.

The code shows a well-structured component with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive error handling. The use of `deepEqualAndDiff` suggests an effort to optimize performance and avoid unnecessary API calls.  The extensive conditional logic indicates the complexity of handling different loyalty provider integrations.

# Activity Summary for 08/08/2025

## 10:59:37
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` throughout the day of July 8th, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor refinements and bug fixes, as the core functionality remains consistent across all revisions. There are no substantial structural changes to the code.  The timestamps indicate a period of intense development activity between 12:32 PM and 12:57 PM.

The Svelte component heavily relies on numerous stores from `../../common/stores/LoginStore` and `../../common/stores/CommonStore`, managing various aspects of user address, login status, and checkout flow.  The code repeatedly manipulates `addressInputs` and `addressFields` arrays, dynamically adding or removing fields based on conditional logic involving `$store_enableRecipientPhone`, `addressMMIFlow`, and `$store_additionalAddress`.  These conditions likely adapt the address form based on user context (e.g., billing vs. shipping addresses, optional fields, address suggestion flow).

The component also includes extensive analytics tracking using `fireGtmEvent` and `logEvent`, suggesting a focus on monitoring user interactions within the address input section.  The `onMount` function sets up several subscriptions to these stores and performs actions like setting focus and dispatching events. The `onDestroy` function cleans up the subscriptions and resets relevant store values.  The `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` lifecycle functions handle conditional logic for dynamically adjusting the displayed address fields.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Helper.service.ts` file, updated at 07/08/2025, 21:32:32, contains utility functions for interacting with various stores related to order management, including those responsible for estimated delivery date, order status, payment status, and bottom sheet management. It also includes functions related to address autofill detection and logging autofill events.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/localFileServices.ts` file, updated at 07/08/2025, 21:33:18, defines functions for generating base URLs for different APIs based on the environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`). The code also contains functions to set up initial values for cart data and request IDs and has functions related to generating URLs for different services.  It dynamically chooses the appropriate base URL based on the `env` variable, obtained from a store. The file also includes functions that return different types of tokens based on the environment,  `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken`.  These tokens are likely used for authentication and authorization.


The `.gitignore` file lists files and directories to be excluded from version control, including standard directories like `node_modules` and build artifacts. Notably, it excludes `./src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, indicating this file likely contains sensitive configuration data.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/integration-settings/loyaltyPoints.tsx` was updated on 08/08/2025 at 14:22:42.  This component renders a settings page for integrating various loyalty point providers (Pop Coins, Nector Coins, Flits, Yotpo, Credit Yard, Easy Rewards, Xeno).  It uses a `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and interacts with a Redux store (`@store/integrations`) for saving credentials.

The key functionality includes:

* **Toggling Loyalty Providers:** Users can enable/disable loyalty providers via switches.  Only one provider can be active at a time.  Enabling a provider with customization options opens a drawer for configuring settings.

* **Customization Drawer:** A drawer displays a customizable form (`RenderForm`) specific to the selected provider.  This form allows for various settings adjustments depending on the provider.  Special handling exists for 'nector', including JSON manipulation of `TransactionMetaDataToUpdateOrder`.  'flits' and 'nector' have specific data type conversions within the save function.

* **Data Handling:** The component uses `useMerchantConfigApi` to fetch and save configuration.  It employs `deepEqualAndDiff` for efficient comparison of configurations before saving changes. Error handling is present to display messages to the user. The component also handles different data types and structures depending on which loyalty provider is selected.

* **Form Management:**  The component uses `Form.useForm` from `gokwik-ui-kit` for managing the form state.  It populates the form with existing credentials from the Redux store and handles saving changes.  The save function includes numerous checks and transformations to properly format data based on selected provider.

The code shows a well-structured component with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive error handling. The use of `deepEqualAndDiff` suggests an effort to optimize performance and avoid unnecessary API calls.  The extensive conditional logic indicates the complexity of handling different loyalty provider integrations.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` was updated on 08/08/2025 at 15:06:05.  This React component handles editing order details.  Significant changes involve extensive updates to the handling of line items, including adding, removing, and modifying quantities.  A discount feature was implemented, allowing for both fixed amount and percentage-based discounts with detailed tracking of applied discounts and recently deleted items.  The UI is built using the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and includes features like a table for displaying line items, input fields for quantity and discount details, and modals for confirmation and error handling.  The code utilizes React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useMemo` for managing component state and optimizing performance.  Data is fetched and updated using custom hooks and functions (e.g., `makeAPICall`, `formatAmount`).  Error handling and user feedback mechanisms (using `message` from `gokwik-ui-kit`) are integrated throughout the component.  The component interacts with a Redux store for accessing user configuration and merchant details.  The code demonstrates a robust approach to managing order editing, incorporating many considerations for user experience and data integrity.  The `useMemo` hook is used extensively for performance optimization of calculations and data transformations.


## 15:59:17
The log shows multiple revisions to a Svelte component (`PaymentHeaderShipping.svelte`) responsible for displaying and handling shipping method selection in a checkout UI, along with changes to an environment service file (`EnvironmentService.ts`) and a merchant HTML file (`merchant.html`).

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentsHeader/PaymentHeaderShipping.svelte`**: This file underwent several revisions between 15:28:06 and 15:40:30 on August 8, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent:  displaying available shipping options, allowing users to select a method, and updating the UI accordingly.  Minor changes include conditional rendering adjustments (specifically handling the display of estimated delivery dates based on the presence of `store_deliveryEstimate` and `$store_requestIdObject?.custom_config?.use_custom_edd` ) and  removal of some unnecessary `svelte-ignore` directives. The updates suggest iterative improvements to the UI and handling of edge cases related to delivery date display and conditional rendering.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**: This file was updated twice, at 15:28:49 and 15:29:01 on August 8, 2025. The changes involved modifications to the `api_url` function. Specifically, in the second update, the  `local` environment's API URL was changed from a commented-out localhost URL to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`. This indicates a shift in the local development environment's API endpoint.  The file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.), suggesting a system designed for flexible deployment across different environments.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**: This file was updated once at 15:29:32 on August 8, 2025.  The update involved modifications to the JavaScript code responsible for initializing the Gokwik SDK and handling communication with the parent window.  The `merchantInfo` object includes information such as merchant ID, environment, and Facebook Pixel ID, demonstrating the setup for tracking and identifying the merchant within the Gokwik system.  A commented-out section regarding an analytics script suggests potential future integration. The changes suggest improvements to the initialization process and merchant information handling on the merchant's webpage.


## 16:59:17
The log shows code changes across three files on August 8, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 16:07:33. This file is an HTML page containing a merchant checkout button.  The update includes modifications to JavaScript code that initializes a `gokwikSdk`, handles payment processing using `window.postMessage`, manages cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`), and embeds a Privy widget.  The script also contains numerous commented-out lines of code related to different merchant IDs (`mid`) suggesting testing across various environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.).

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated multiple times (16:07:46, 16:14:08, 16:16:39). This TypeScript file is a service for managing environment-specific configurations.  The updates consistently involve changes to functions that return different API base URLs (`getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`), CDN paths (`cdn_path`), and merchant URLs (`merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`).  The code uses the `env` variable to determine the correct URL for each environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production, and several variations thereof).  These repeated edits suggest ongoing adjustments to API endpoints or refining environment handling. There's also logic to set a cart object based on environment.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/Address.svelte` was updated three times (16:31:23, 16:32:39, 16:32:50). This Svelte component handles address input and submission.  The updates involve refinements to the handling of pincode input, including input validation, error handling, and integration with geo-location services (`triggerGeolocationAPI`, `geoLocationMessageListener`).  The  `handlePincodeInput` function now includes `console.log("Input Triggered")` which was likely added for debugging purposes.  The code interacts with various stores (`store_pincode`, `store_show_input`, etc.), making API calls (`submitPincode`, `rgeocodeAPI`), and fires analytics events. Minor updates to styling were also observed.  The multiple updates likely reflect iterative improvements to the address input and validation process.


## 19:56:30
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/Address.svelte` between 17:17:28 and 17:26:48 on August 8, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refinements to the address input component.

The initial version (17:17:28) is a comprehensive Svelte component handling address input, including pincode validation, geolocation integration via an API (`rgeocodeAPI`, `geolocationAPIEvent`), and interaction with various stores (`store_pincode`, `store_phoneNo`, etc.) for managing application state.  It also includes features like a shipping method selection (`ShippingMethod` component) and GST handling (`Gst` component).  The component uses several utility functions and services for functionalities like analytics tracking (`fireAnalyticsGa4`, `logEvent`), pincode submission (`submitPincode`), and credit removal (`removeCredits`).

Subsequent revisions (17:21:35, 17:21:50, 17:26:12, 17:26:48) primarily involve minor code adjustments.  Specifically,  a redundant `pincode = pincode;` assignment within the `on:triggerPincodeCall` event handler is added and then removed across multiple commits.  There is also a minor addition to the `.floating-label` style in the CSS section to include `background-color: var(--white);` in one of the commits, suggesting improvements to the visual styling.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout these revisions. The changes are iterative and incremental, suggesting debugging or minor improvements rather than major structural changes.

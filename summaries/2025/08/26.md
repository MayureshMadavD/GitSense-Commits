# Activity Summary for 26/08/2025

## 16:33:10
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` between 23:02:44 and 23:06:42 on August 25, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor and involve commenting out and uncommenting sections of code within the `api_url` function, specifically related to URL selection based on the `env` variable and cookie values.  There are no substantial structural changes to the file during this period. A more significant change occurs at 23:14:15 on August 25, 2025,  where a condition within the `api_url` function is modified to ensure both `getCookieGk('custom_form')` and `getCookieGk('get_url_from_cookie')` are checked before setting the URL to a value from a cookie.

A separate file, `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`, is updated at 01:13:18 on August 26, 2025. This update adds a significant amount of JavaScript code managing merchant information, cookie handling (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`), and interaction with a GoKwik SDK. The JavaScript code includes functions for processing payments (`processPayment`), event handling (`on`, `emit`), and UI manipulation (`hideButton`).  It also shows integration with several marketing and analytics platforms. The HTML includes a form for entering merchant ID, JSON input, and environment selection. A button labeled "Initiate Checkout" triggers the `goKwikCheckout` function.

The remaining files (`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/*.ts`) are updated on August 26, 2025, between 01:32:27 and 01:34:01.  These files contain code for sending analytics events to various platforms (CleverTap, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Klaviyo, Moengage, Netcore, and WebEngage).  The code for each platform is largely independent but demonstrates a common pattern of structuring data for events. They all involve functions to create event data objects, often using a common `createBody` function to consolidate information, and then utilize platform-specific functions (`clevertap.event.push`, `fbq`, `ga`, etc.) to send the data.  There is also recurring use of helper functions for phone number formatting and for mapping keys to analytics platform-specific key names. The WebEngage file is updated again at 01:34:12 with seemingly minor changes.  The final update is to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` at 01:38:03 and 01:38:22 on August 26th, 2025.  The updates include handling of various events, management of application state through Svelte stores, and integration with various analytics services. A key part of this update is the addition of `checkoutLinkIntegration` function and handling of checkout links.  The time difference between the two App.svelte changes shows minor changes.

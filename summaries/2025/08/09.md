The log shows modifications to React components for a data dashboard, primarily focusing on charting and data validation.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/chart/chart.jsx` underwent multiple revisions between 08/08/2025 and 09/08/2025.  The initial version (23:58:27 on 08/08/2025) introduces three chart components: `MerchantStatusChart`, `AvergeStatusChart`, and `MonthlyARRChart`. `MerchantStatusChart` displays CE data summaries using a bar chart, allowing users to filter by CE name.  `AvergeStatusChart` shows average CE metrics (go-live days, expected ARR, blocked merchants) in a composed chart. `MonthlyARRChart` displays monthly ARR data for the last five months, including data validation.  The validation includes checks for merchant name, expected ARR, category, and kickoff date.

Subsequent updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/chart/chart.jsx` (00:03:00, 00:03:30, 00:04:01, and 00:05:05 on 09/08/2025) refine the `MonthlyARRChart` component.  Improvements include more robust date parsing (`parseKickoffDate` function) to handle different date formats and prevent timezone issues.  The date validation is enhanced; a "reasonable range" check is added but doesn't invalidate the data. The logic to aggregate monthly ARR data by category was simplified and improved for correctness.  The final version includes a more efficient method of calculating the total ARR.  There are no major structural changes to the other chart components across these revisions.


`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/chart/validationData.jsx` (00:01:53 on 09/08/2025) introduces a `DataValidationTable` component. This component displays data validation errors in a table format, categorizing errors as "Critical" or "Minor" based on predefined rules.  The validation rules are hardcoded within the component, focusing on fields such as `expectedarr`, `mqm`, `merchanttype`, `platform`, and several others.  The table provides filtering capabilities based on error category and employs Ant Design components for styling and presentation.

# Activity Summary for 19/08/2025

## 08:20:18
The provided log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` between 00:00:27 and 00:02:01 on August 19, 2025.  The file is a React component dealing with product-based shipping data.  The core functionality involves displaying and manipulating shipping rules, associating them with products or collections, and managing rule details like price, calculation method, and multipliers.

Key changes across the revisions include modifications to the `columns` array used for rendering a table.  Initially,  columns for 'Rule ID', 'Rule Name', and 'Rule Price' were present, but these were later adjusted or removed. The 'Mapped Shipping ID' column was added and its rendering was updated to use a `Button` component with type 'link'.

The `fields` array, which defines form fields for managing shipping rules, remained largely consistent, but the code within the `custom` field's `render` function, handling the addition and removal of products and collections using `ProductSearch` components, shows no significant alterations in content, only minor structural changes around spacing and formatting.

The `processProductBasedShippingData` function, responsible for processing shipping data, remained unchanged throughout the revisions.  Similarly, helper functions like `dataMapperForItems` and the `selectedOptions` memoization logic experienced no content changes.  The changes primarily focused on the presentation and display of the data within the UI component rather than core logic.  The small time intervals between commits suggest iterative development and UI refinements.

The log shows updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` file between 11:48:31 and 12:38:53, with numerous minor modifications within that timespan.  These changes primarily involve no significant code alterations; rather, the edits appear to be refinements and adjustments to an already-existing React component responsible for editing abandoned cart details. There's no discernible pattern in these repeated edits other than iterative development.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was modified twice: at 11:46:44 and 12:16:45 and 12:39:33. The changes involved updates to the URLs used for loading various  `@gokwik` modules based on the environment (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  The `sandbox` environment's `@gokwik/utilities`  URL changed from `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` at 12:16:45.  Then it switched back to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` at 12:39:33.  This suggests potential configuration testing across different environments.

The `.env` file was also modified twice: at 11:46:33 and 12:16:34 and 12:39:21.  These changes involved switching between different API base URLs and bulk discount URLs for development (`dev`), QA (`qa`), and sandbox environments.  The changes were made to uncomment and comment out specific lines corresponding to each environment.  This indicates environment-specific configuration management.  The changes are related to enabling and disabling specific environment configurations.

The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` file.  All revisions on this file between 14:01:25 and 14:41:52  contain the same code. The code defines a TypeScript class containing numerous asynchronous functions (`getCartJs`, `getAbandonCart`, `getRequestId`, `getUserExperiments`, `updateCartAnalytics`, `assignUserVariant`, `submitPhoneNumber`, `checkLogin`, `deleteAddress`, `verifyOTP`, `resendOtpCall`, `verifyPincode`, `addAddress`, `getAllAddress`) that interact with a merchant API.  These functions handle various aspects of an e-commerce checkout process, including cart management, user authentication, address management, and experiment tracking.  They consistently use `getCall` and `postCall` functions from `ApiService`, indicating a common pattern for API interaction.  The code also heavily utilizes numerous store subscribers (e.g., `store_localStorageObject`, `store_offers`, `store_requestIdObject`) from different store modules (`OrderStore`, `LoginStore`, `CommonStore`), suggesting a reactive architecture employing a unidirectional data flow pattern.  No substantial changes were made to the code across all the revisions.

This code defines a React component `GiftCardsVouchers` for managing gift card and voucher integrations within a merchant dashboard.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and interacts with a Redux store (`@store/integrations`) for managing configuration data.

The component allows enabling/disabling various integration providers (Shopify Gift Cards, Qwikcilver, Gyftr, Internal Wallet, Nector Credits) via switches.  Enabling/disabling triggers validation to prevent conflicts (e.g., only one gift card provider can be active).  A drawer (`Drawer` component) is used to customize individual integrations via a form (`Form` component).

The `handleSwitchChange` function updates the configuration based on switch changes.  `handleSave` handles saving changes, performing validation and making API calls (`saveConfig`, `saveCreds`, `saveRewards`) to persist the changes.  The component uses selectors (`selectMerchantCreds`, `selectMerchantRewards`) to retrieve data from the Redux store and `useMerchantConfigApi` for API interactions.

`useEffect` ensures the form is pre-populated with existing data.  The component extensively uses conditional logic to handle different scenarios and to prevent invalid configurations.  The data is structured using arrays (`InternalWallet`, `GiftCards`, `Voucher`, `StoreCredit`) to represent different integration providers, each with properties like `key`, `title`, `icon`, `checked`, and `customize`.  Error messages are displayed using `message.error` to inform the user about configuration conflicts. The component also includes a link to external documentation.  The timestamp of the last code update is 19/08/2025, 16:32:13.


## 16:37:14
The log shows multiple revisions of two Svelte components: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/gift-card/GiftCard.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`.

**GiftCard.svelte:**  The component underwent two minor revisions between 16:11:22 and 16:13:43 on August 19, 2025.  The only change was the removal of a `console.log` statement from the `<script>` section.  The component handles the display and management of gift cards, including redeeming, removing, and showing a bottom sheet for input.  It interacts with several stores (`store_bottomSheetState`, `store_giftCard`, `store_giftCardTotal`, `store_giftCardProvider`) and services (`removeGiftCard`, `fireGtmEvent`, `logEvent`).

**Discounts.svelte:** This component, significantly larger and more complex than `GiftCard.svelte`,  underwent multiple revisions between 16:14:46 and 16:26:38 on August 19, 2025.  The changes across these revisions primarily involved refinements within the extensive `onMount` function. These revisions focused on managing various discount types (e.g., automatic, stacked, partner acquisition offers) and their interactions with multiple stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore`.  The component handles the application and removal of discounts,  credit application,  and interaction with loyalty programs.  The code is highly dependent on numerous stores and services, implying a complex system for handling discounts during checkout.  The `onMount` function showcases extensive subscription management to various stores using `subscribe`, indicating a reactive approach to updating the UI based on store changes.  There's heavy use of asynchronous operations (`async`/`await`) for API calls related to discount application and removal. No functional changes are apparent in the final revisions.  The core logic and structure remain consistent.

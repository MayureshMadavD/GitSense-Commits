# Activity Summary for 19/08/2025

## 08:20:18
The provided log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` between 00:00:27 and 00:02:01 on August 19, 2025.  The file is a React component dealing with product-based shipping data.  The core functionality involves displaying and manipulating shipping rules, associating them with products or collections, and managing rule details like price, calculation method, and multipliers.

Key changes across the revisions include modifications to the `columns` array used for rendering a table.  Initially,  columns for 'Rule ID', 'Rule Name', and 'Rule Price' were present, but these were later adjusted or removed. The 'Mapped Shipping ID' column was added and its rendering was updated to use a `Button` component with type 'link'.

The `fields` array, which defines form fields for managing shipping rules, remained largely consistent, but the code within the `custom` field's `render` function, handling the addition and removal of products and collections using `ProductSearch` components, shows no significant alterations in content, only minor structural changes around spacing and formatting.

The `processProductBasedShippingData` function, responsible for processing shipping data, remained unchanged throughout the revisions.  Similarly, helper functions like `dataMapperForItems` and the `selectedOptions` memoization logic experienced no content changes.  The changes primarily focused on the presentation and display of the data within the UI component rather than core logic.  The small time intervals between commits suggest iterative development and UI refinements.

The log shows updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` file between 11:48:31 and 12:38:53, with numerous minor modifications within that timespan.  These changes primarily involve no significant code alterations; rather, the edits appear to be refinements and adjustments to an already-existing React component responsible for editing abandoned cart details. There's no discernible pattern in these repeated edits other than iterative development.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was modified twice: at 11:46:44 and 12:16:45 and 12:39:33. The changes involved updates to the URLs used for loading various  `@gokwik` modules based on the environment (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  The `sandbox` environment's `@gokwik/utilities`  URL changed from `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` at 12:16:45.  Then it switched back to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` at 12:39:33.  This suggests potential configuration testing across different environments.

The `.env` file was also modified twice: at 11:46:33 and 12:16:34 and 12:39:21.  These changes involved switching between different API base URLs and bulk discount URLs for development (`dev`), QA (`qa`), and sandbox environments.  The changes were made to uncomment and comment out specific lines corresponding to each environment.  This indicates environment-specific configuration management.  The changes are related to enabling and disabling specific environment configurations.


## 15:37:34
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` file.  All revisions on this file between 14:01:25 and 14:41:52  contain the same code. The code defines a TypeScript class containing numerous asynchronous functions (`getCartJs`, `getAbandonCart`, `getRequestId`, `getUserExperiments`, `updateCartAnalytics`, `assignUserVariant`, `submitPhoneNumber`, `checkLogin`, `deleteAddress`, `verifyOTP`, `resendOtpCall`, `verifyPincode`, `addAddress`, `getAllAddress`) that interact with a merchant API.  These functions handle various aspects of an e-commerce checkout process, including cart management, user authentication, address management, and experiment tracking.  They consistently use `getCall` and `postCall` functions from `ApiService`, indicating a common pattern for API interaction.  The code also heavily utilizes numerous store subscribers (e.g., `store_localStorageObject`, `store_offers`, `store_requestIdObject`) from different store modules (`OrderStore`, `LoginStore`, `CommonStore`), suggesting a reactive architecture employing a unidirectional data flow pattern.  No substantial changes were made to the code across all the revisions.

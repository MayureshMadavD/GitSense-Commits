# Activity Summary for 19/08/2025

The provided log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` between 00:00:27 and 00:02:01 on August 19, 2025.  The file is a React component dealing with product-based shipping data.  The core functionality involves displaying and manipulating shipping rules, associating them with products or collections, and managing rule details like price, calculation method, and multipliers.

Key changes across the revisions include modifications to the `columns` array used for rendering a table.  Initially,  columns for 'Rule ID', 'Rule Name', and 'Rule Price' were present, but these were later adjusted or removed. The 'Mapped Shipping ID' column was added and its rendering was updated to use a `Button` component with type 'link'.

The `fields` array, which defines form fields for managing shipping rules, remained largely consistent, but the code within the `custom` field's `render` function, handling the addition and removal of products and collections using `ProductSearch` components, shows no significant alterations in content, only minor structural changes around spacing and formatting.

The `processProductBasedShippingData` function, responsible for processing shipping data, remained unchanged throughout the revisions.  Similarly, helper functions like `dataMapperForItems` and the `selectedOptions` memoization logic experienced no content changes.  The changes primarily focused on the presentation and display of the data within the UI component rather than core logic.  The small time intervals between commits suggest iterative development and UI refinements.

# Activity Summary for 23/06/2025

## 13:51:21
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` between 13:31:11 and 13:43:41 on June 23, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve refinements to the display and calculation of the order summary, specifically how the `mrpDiscountData` and `ppCodAmount` are handled in the UI.  The changes include adding and removing `JSON.stringify` calls around `$store_mrpDiscountData` and adjusting how the total price is displayed when `totalDiscountOnMrp` is greater than zero. The file also uses multiple stores from  `../../common/stores/LoginStore` and `../../common/stores/CommonStore` and `common/stores/OrderStore` for data management and updates.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated at 12:58:37 on June 23, 2025. This update focuses on client-side JavaScript code that initializes a Gokwik SDK, manages merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`), and sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`).  The code includes various merchant IDs (mids) suggesting different environment configurations (QA, sandbox, production, etc.). A commented-out analytics script is also present.  The script also contains potentially sensitive data (`data-appid`, `data-appsecret`) which is redacted in this summary.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated at 12:54:30 on June 23, 2025. This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs and services based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local, etc.).  The code extensively uses conditional logic to determine the appropriate URL for different environments.  It also subscribes to stores for merchant URL and environment settings.  The logic shows a complex mapping between environments and API endpoints.


## 14:51:26
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` file between 13:57:52 and 14:18:25 on June 23, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the display of order summary information, particularly concerning pricing and conditional rendering based on various store variables.

The changes involve adjustments to the conditional display of elements like the "free gift added" message and the strikethrough price when `mrpDiscountData` is available.  There's a noticeable pattern of iterative refinement to the conditional logic within the `totalPrice` calculation and the display of the `cart-amount`. The logic controlling the display of the strikethrough price for MRP discounts underwent several changes, adjusting the comparison operators (`>=`, `<=`, `>`) to fine-tune its behavior.

The UI updates involve changes to styling classes and the structure of the order summary display. A significant change around 14:13:55 introduced a new header structure for the order summary, improving the presentation of item count and pricing. The addition of a `totalItems` variable and related changes to display quantities enhances user understanding of the contents of their cart.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was modified once at 14:17:13. This file manages environment-specific configurations for various API endpoints,  CDN paths, and token values.  The changes made to this file are not described further because it contains potential sensitive information.

# Activity Summary for 23/06/2025

## 13:51:21
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` between 13:31:11 and 13:43:41 on June 23, 2025.  These revisions primarily involve refinements to the display and calculation of the order summary, specifically how the `mrpDiscountData` and `ppCodAmount` are handled in the UI.  The changes include adding and removing `JSON.stringify` calls around `$store_mrpDiscountData` and adjusting how the total price is displayed when `totalDiscountOnMrp` is greater than zero. The file also uses multiple stores from  `../../common/stores/LoginStore` and `../../common/stores/CommonStore` and `common/stores/OrderStore` for data management and updates.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated at 12:58:37 on June 23, 2025. This update focuses on client-side JavaScript code that initializes a Gokwik SDK, manages merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`), and sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`).  The code includes various merchant IDs (mids) suggesting different environment configurations (QA, sandbox, production, etc.). A commented-out analytics script is also present.  The script also contains potentially sensitive data (`data-appid`, `data-appsecret`) which is redacted in this summary.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated at 12:54:30 on June 23, 2025. This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs and services based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local, etc.).  The code extensively uses conditional logic to determine the appropriate URL for different environments.  It also subscribes to stores for merchant URL and environment settings.  The logic shows a complex mapping between environments and API endpoints.

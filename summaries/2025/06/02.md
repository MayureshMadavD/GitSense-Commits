# Activity Summary for 02/06/2025

## 16:50:46
The log shows modifications to two files within the `/Users/madav/Downloads/ss` directory.  An `index.html` file was updated at 15:50:52 on 02/06/2025, though the content of this update is not provided.  The `index.ejs` file underwent two changes on the same day.  At 15:52:19, a basic HTML structure was added, including a `<FORM>` element (note capitalization).  Two minutes later (15:52:32), this `<FORM>` element was updated to `<form action="" method="post">`, specifying a POST method for form submission.  The key pattern is the iterative refinement of the `index.ejs` file, suggesting a progressive development process.


## 17:11:39
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` file between 16:37:20 and 17:08:54 on February 6th, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining a React component, `RichTextEditor`.

The changes involve minor code style adjustments (e.g., spacing, arrow function syntax).  The most significant change is the movement of the `onPasteCapture` event handler from the `div` element with the id `editor` to the inner `span` element within that `div`. This happened between 17:07:20 and 17:08:10.  There is also a reversion of the event handler back to the `div` with id `editor` at 17:08:54.  The `onPasteCapture` event is connected to the `handleTextFormatting` function, suggesting improvements in handling pasted content.  The component consistently manages text formatting (bold, italic, underline, links), input character limits (64 characters), and adds target="_blank" to links for security.  No functional changes are apparent beyond the event handler repositioning.

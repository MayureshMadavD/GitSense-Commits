# Activity Summary for 02/06/2025

## 16:50:46
The log shows modifications to two files within the `/Users/madav/Downloads/ss` directory.  An `index.html` file was updated at 15:50:52 on 02/06/2025, though the content of this update is not provided.  The `index.ejs` file underwent two changes on the same day.  At 15:52:19, a basic HTML structure was added, including a `<FORM>` element (note capitalization).  Two minutes later (15:52:32), this `<FORM>` element was updated to `<form action="" method="post">`, specifying a POST method for form submission.  The key pattern is the iterative refinement of the `index.ejs` file, suggesting a progressive development process.


## 17:11:39
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` file between 16:37:20 and 17:08:54 on February 6th, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining a React component, `RichTextEditor`.

The changes involve minor code style adjustments (e.g., spacing, arrow function syntax).  The most significant change is the movement of the `onPasteCapture` event handler from the `div` element with the id `editor` to the inner `span` element within that `div`. This happened between 17:07:20 and 17:08:10.  There is also a reversion of the event handler back to the `div` with id `editor` at 17:08:54.  The `onPasteCapture` event is connected to the `handleTextFormatting` function, suggesting improvements in handling pasted content.  The component consistently manages text formatting (bold, italic, underline, links), input character limits (64 characters), and adds target="_blank" to links for security.  No functional changes are apparent beyond the event handler repositioning.


## 18:11:40
The log shows multiple revisions of a React component called `RichTextEditor` between 17:19 and 17:39 on February 6th, 2025.  The component is a rich text editor with functionalities for bold, italic, underline, and link insertion.

The primary changes revolve around the `handleTextFormatting` function, which handles paste events.  Initial versions logged the event object itself or parts of it (`event.currentTarget.innerHTML`, `event.target`).  Later versions focused on extracting and processing the pasted text's content using the `extractMatchFromString` function, specifically obtaining plain text using `event.clipboardData.getData('text')` and subsequently updating the component's state and invoking the `onChange` prop with the processed data.  The final version successfully integrates the pasted text's formatting and content into the editor state.

There was also a minor change in the `onPaste` event handler; it changed from `onPaste` to `onPasteCapture` and then back to `onPaste`.  This might have been an attempt to capture the paste event earlier in the event capturing/bubbling phase.


The `extractMatchFromString` function consistently parses the HTML content for bold, italic, and underline tags, extracting their content and creating a processed result object containing both the modified HTML string and extracted plain text.  This function remains unchanged throughout the revisions.  The character limit of 64 is consistently enforced throughout all revisions.

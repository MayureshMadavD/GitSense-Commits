# Activity Summary for 02/06/2025

## 16:50:46
The log shows modifications to two files within the `/Users/madav/Downloads/ss` directory.  An `index.html` file was updated at 15:50:52 on 02/06/2025, though the content of this update is not provided.  The `index.ejs` file underwent two changes on the same day.  At 15:52:19, a basic HTML structure was added, including a `<FORM>` element (note capitalization).  Two minutes later (15:52:32), this `<FORM>` element was updated to `<form action="" method="post">`, specifying a POST method for form submission.  The key pattern is the iterative refinement of the `index.ejs` file, suggesting a progressive development process.


## 17:11:39
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` file between 16:37:20 and 17:08:54 on February 6th, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining a React component, `RichTextEditor`.

The changes involve minor code style adjustments (e.g., spacing, arrow function syntax).  The most significant change is the movement of the `onPasteCapture` event handler from the `div` element with the id `editor` to the inner `span` element within that `div`. This happened between 17:07:20 and 17:08:10.  There is also a reversion of the event handler back to the `div` with id `editor` at 17:08:54.  The `onPasteCapture` event is connected to the `handleTextFormatting` function, suggesting improvements in handling pasted content.  The component consistently manages text formatting (bold, italic, underline, links), input character limits (64 characters), and adds target="_blank" to links for security.  No functional changes are apparent beyond the event handler repositioning.


## 18:11:40
The log shows multiple revisions of a React component called `RichTextEditor` between 17:19 and 17:39 on February 6th, 2025.  The component is a rich text editor with functionalities for bold, italic, underline, and link insertion.

The primary changes revolve around the `handleTextFormatting` function, which handles paste events.  Initial versions logged the event object itself or parts of it (`event.currentTarget.innerHTML`, `event.target`).  Later versions focused on extracting and processing the pasted text's content using the `extractMatchFromString` function, specifically obtaining plain text using `event.clipboardData.getData('text')` and subsequently updating the component's state and invoking the `onChange` prop with the processed data.  The final version successfully integrates the pasted text's formatting and content into the editor state.

There was also a minor change in the `onPaste` event handler; it changed from `onPaste` to `onPasteCapture` and then back to `onPaste`.  This might have been an attempt to capture the paste event earlier in the event capturing/bubbling phase.


The `extractMatchFromString` function consistently parses the HTML content for bold, italic, and underline tags, extracting their content and creating a processed result object containing both the modified HTML string and extracted plain text.  This function remains unchanged throughout the revisions.  The character limit of 64 is consistently enforced throughout all revisions.


## 19:23:30
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`, a React component for a rich text editor.  The main changes revolve around the `handleTextFormatting` function, specifically how it handles pasted content.

Initially (18:25:10 and 18:25:39), the `handleTextFormatting` function attempted to get pasted data using `'text'` and `'text/html'` respectively, but the `extractMatchFromString` function (which processes the pasted content) was commented out.  This suggests an incomplete or experimental implementation of pasting functionality.

Between 18:26:39 and 18:27:32, the code was modified to use `'text/plain'` for getting pasted data, and a `console.log` statement was added to display the pasted value.  The `extractMatchFromString` function remained commented out in this version.

Finally, at 18:28:28, the `extractMatchFromString` function was uncommented within the `handleTextFormatting` function, integrating the content extraction and processing. This version uses `'text/plain'` to retrieve the pasted data and then uses the `extractMatchFromString` to process this data before using it in the `onChange` function.


Throughout all versions, the component consistently provides functionalities for bold, italic, underline, and link insertion, utilizing the `document.execCommand` method. The character limit remains consistently set to 64.  The overall structure of the component—including the UI elements from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library—remained unchanged.  The evolution of the paste handling shows a clear progression towards a fully functional paste mechanism.

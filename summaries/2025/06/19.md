# Activity Summary for 19/06/2025

The provided code logs show modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`.  Both files are related to a discount analytics dashboard.

The `discountAnalytics.tsx` file underwent two updates. The first (12:07:54) established the initial structure of the discount analytics dashboard,  displaying various discount metrics using components like `AnalyticsCard`, `Table`, `Select`, and a custom `Chart` component.  The second update (12:39:57) appears to be minor and does not introduce significant functional changes.  Both versions heavily rely on data fetched from `getDiscountAnalyticsData` and employ numerous components for data visualization and interaction. Download functionality is implemented via a `DownloadIcon` component, using different `apiKey` values for various data sections.


The `chart.tsx` file contains components for visualizing data, including a generic `Chart` component supporting multiple chart types and a `MetricsGroup` component for displaying key metrics. It also includes components like `KeyMetricCard` and `DiscountMetricCard` for displaying individual metrics. The file underwent two updates. The first (12:39:18)  introduced the initial chart component implementation. The second update (12:40:33) improved the `getChartData` function within the `Chart` component, making it more flexible to handle different input data types (single string or array of strings).  A final update (12:50:21) further refactored `getChartData` to accept a single `inputData` parameter, which can be a string or an array, enhancing code reusability and readability.  The chart component uses `dayjs` for date formatting and `ReactApexChart` for chart rendering. A recurring element is the handling of potential data missing for KwikPass integrations, displaying a warning message with a link for more information.

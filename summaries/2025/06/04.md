# Activity Summary for 04/06/2025

## 10:54:36
The log shows iterative changes to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`.  The changes primarily focus on the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function in `commonFunctions.tsx` and the UI rendering of discount analytics data in `discountAnalytics.tsx`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 23:37 and 23:53.  The key change involved the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function. Initially, this function returned an object with `cardsSection` and `discountTypeOverview` as nested objects.  Later revisions altered the structure of the returned object, ultimately resulting in a change where `cardsSection` became a simple array and `discountTypeOverview` became an array containing the `discountTypeOverview` array and the `last_updated_at` value.  The other functions within this file (`triggerDownload`, `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`) remained unchanged throughout the log.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`**: This file also saw multiple revisions during the same timeframe. The major changes revolved around how the discount data, fetched using `getDiscountAnalyticsData`, was used to populate the UI components.  The initial version used hardcoded data.  Subsequent updates dynamically populated the UI using data from `getDiscountAnalyticsData`, leading to adjustments in how data was accessed and processed to display in tables and charts. Specifically, the component now utilizes the `discountTypeOverview` data for filtering and displaying discount types.  There was also a significant UI enhancement adding filtering options by "Type of Coupon Code," "Category," and "Status" for the third table (`table3Data`).  The changes in this file directly reflect the changes to the structure of the data returned by the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function.


The overall pattern observed is a refinement of the data handling and UI presentation related to discount analytics. The initial implementation had hardcoded data. This was improved by fetching and rendering data dynamically, requiring several iterative updates to adapt the UI to the evolving data structure returned by `commonFunctions.tsx`.  The final versions show a more complete and dynamic display of discount analytics.

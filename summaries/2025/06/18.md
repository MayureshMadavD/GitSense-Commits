# Activity Summary for 18/06/2025

## 16:53:32
The log shows two commits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`, both within a minute of each other on June 18, 2025.  The changes are minor and pertain to the pagination settings within a Table component.

The first commit (16:21:06) renders the `Table` component without pagination (`pagination={false}`).

The second commit (16:22:55) modifies the `Table` component to include pagination, specifically setting `pagination={{ pageSize: 8, position: ['bottomRight'] }}`.  All other aspects of the component remain unchanged.  The code's overall structure, involving various analytics cards, charts (DiscountBarChart, Chart), and data fetching/processing functions, remains consistent throughout both commits.  The use of `AnalyticsCard`, `DiscountMetricCard`, and `DownloadIcon` components from a `gokwik-ui-kit` library suggests a consistent design pattern.  The code heavily uses data from `discountData`, which seems to be a prop containing various structured analytics information.

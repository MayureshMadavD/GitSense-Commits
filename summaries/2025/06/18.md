# Activity Summary for 18/06/2025

## 16:53:32
The log shows two commits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`, both within a minute of each other on June 18, 2025.  The changes are minor and pertain to the pagination settings within a Table component.

The first commit (16:21:06) renders the `Table` component without pagination (`pagination={false}`).

The second commit (16:22:55) modifies the `Table` component to include pagination, specifically setting `pagination={{ pageSize: 8, position: ['bottomRight'] }}`.  All other aspects of the component remain unchanged.  The code's overall structure, involving various analytics cards, charts (DiscountBarChart, Chart), and data fetching/processing functions, remains consistent throughout both commits.  The use of `AnalyticsCard`, `DiscountMetricCard`, and `DownloadIcon` components from a `gokwik-ui-kit` library suggests a consistent design pattern.  The code heavily uses data from `discountData`, which seems to be a prop containing various structured analytics information.


## 17:53:37
The log shows several code changes across two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing a React-based discount analytics dashboard.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`:** This file underwent two nearly identical updates within a short time frame (17:28:12 and 17:28:32). No substantive code changes are observable between these two commits.  The component renders various analytics cards, charts (`DiscountBarChart`, `Chart`), and tables using the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library. It retrieves and displays discount-related data, allowing users to filter and download data using options like `Select` components and a `DownloadIcon` component, which appears to require an API key. The displayed data is organized into sections:  metric cards, discount type overview, performance summary, discount usage trend, top discounts (used and failed), and a discount code-level overview.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`:** This file contains data definitions and configurations for charts and tables used within the analytics dashboard. It was updated multiple times (17:33:58, 17:35:26, 17:35:45, 17:37:15).  These changes involved refining the data structures, particularly `SummaryBlocksData` and `ChartRows`.  These structures define the data sources, display formats (e.g., `heroValueTransform: 'amount'`), and tooltip text for various metrics presented in the dashboard.  There's a recurring theme of handling data for both GoKwik and non-GoKwik orders. The `ChartRows` data structure organizes chart data by business and marketing metrics with different filters and formatting options.  The `checkoutFunnelFilters` function appears to dynamically construct filter options based on date ranges.  The consistent use of `realtimeStats`, `funnel`, `orderMetrics`, and `marketingMetrics` as data keys suggests a structured data retrieval process from a backend system.  There is also some commented-out code related to "Gokwik SSO" and COD metrics, indicating features that may be planned or under development.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative improvements and refinements to a React-based discount analytics dashboard, enhancing its data presentation, filtering capabilities, and data structures for improved user experience and maintainability. The frequent commits to `chartsData.tsx` suggest ongoing development and adjustments to the data model and presentation.


## 18:53:47
The log shows multiple updates to components related to discount analytics within a checkout dashboard UI.  The most significant changes occur between 17:58:46 and 18:52:39 on June 18, 2025.  These changes primarily affect `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`: This file undergoes minor revisions, mostly involving whitespace and formatting adjustments with no functional changes to the code.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx`: A crucial modification is made to the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function at 18:03:54.  This function now filters the `successBarChartData` to include only items where `discount_type` is "manual". This suggests a refinement in how manual discount data is handled.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`: This file undergoes a series of edits focused on improving the Chart component.  There are many updates over the period 18:01:58 to 18:52:39,  all related to refining the chart's data handling and visual representation.  A custom tooltip is added to handle multiple key values in the data, enhancing data display and clarifying the chart's presentation of the data. The modifications primarily involve enhancements to the custom tooltip functionality to display `discountUsage`, `couponRedemptions`, and `conversionCr` alongside dates for improved clarity.  No major structural changes are apparent, indicating iterative improvements rather than a complete overhaul.


The recurring theme across these changes is the improvement of data handling and presentation within the discount analytics section of the dashboard.  The small time gaps between some commits suggest an agile development approach with rapid iteration and testing.


## 19:53:35
The provided log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` on June 18th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on improving the chart component's tooltip functionality.

The first revision (18:54:32) introduces the `Chart` component, which renders a chart using `ReactApexChart`.  It fetches and processes data (`primaryBreakdown`, `secondaryBreakdown`), generating chart series based on specified keys (`valueKey`, `multiKeyValue`). A basic tooltip is implicitly defined.

The second revision (18:58:20) enhances the tooltip for the chart.  When multiple key values are provided (`multiKeyValue.length > 1`), a custom tooltip is rendered, displaying data for primary and secondary breakdowns, including dates, discount usage percentage, coupon redemptions, and conversion rates. A noticeable addition is a dotted vertical line separating the primary and secondary data within the tooltip.


The third revision (19:02:38) refines the tooltip's styling by adding padding and a dotted border to separate the primary and secondary data columns within the tooltip, improving readability.  The padding is increased in the table cells for better spacing.

The fourth revision (19:03:30) is identical to the third revision.  There are no observable differences in the code.  This suggests either a redundant commit or a temporary save.

In summary, the major changes involve the iterative development of a custom tooltip for the chart, enhancing its presentation and readability, with one of the commits being seemingly redundant. The `MetricsGroup` and `KeyMetricCard` components remain unchanged throughout the log.  These components seem to deal with displaying metrics and handling user interaction, separate from the charting functionality.


## 20:53:35
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/` directory, specifically focusing on the `discountAnalytics.tsx` component and its associated `commonFunctions.tsx` file.  The changes span a short period, between 20:39:44 and 20:45:06 on June 18th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` underwent a single significant update at 20:39:44. This update added several functions related to discount analytics:  `triggerDownload`, `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `getUniqueOptions`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`, `useDiscountBifurcationData`, and `getDiscountAnalyticsData`. These functions handle data fetching, download triggers, UI elements (like the lock icon), data transformation, and filtering for discount-related information.  The `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function is particularly noteworthy as it processes and structures data from various sources (`DISCOUNT_ANALYTICS_CONFIG`) for different chart displays within the discount analytics dashboard.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` was updated three times between 20:44:32 and 20:45:06.  The primary focus of these changes was enhancing the UI components responsible for displaying discount analytics. The component uses the functions defined in `commonFunctions.tsx` to render various charts and tables.  The most substantial alteration is the introduction of dynamic filtering in the "Discount Code-Level Overview" section at 20:45:06. This change added the ability to filter using `Select` components for "Type of Coupon Code" and "Status," allowing users to narrow down the displayed data.  Before this change, only a search input was available. The filtering is based on calls to `getUniqueOptions` to dynamically generate the dropdown options. The minor differences between the intermediate versions (20:44:32 and 20:44:43) show a very small code refactoring in the `Select` component options, specifically in how the `INACTIVE` and `ACTIVE` options were defined.


## 21:53:35
The log shows multiple revisions to components related to discount analytics within a checkout dashboard UI.  The primary file modified is `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`.  This file underwent several minor revisions between 21:02:46 and 21:03:34, primarily involving adjustments to the width of `Select` components within the UI.  The width of the `Sub-Type` `Select` component was changed from `w-55` to `w-48` and then to `w-56`.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx`, updated at 21:01:15, contains reusable functions for the discount analytics dashboard.  These functions handle actions like triggering downloads, checking permission keys,  redirecting to reports, getting unique options, fetching analytics data, setting discount type overview data, managing discount bifurcation data, and transforming discount analytics data.  This file shows a significant amount of logic related to data handling and UI interactions.

Finally, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` was updated at 21:06:34 and 21:07:32.  These updates focused on the `Chart` component, which renders various chart types.  The primary change involved refining the custom tooltip functionality for charts displaying multiple key values, providing more detailed information in the tooltip including dates, discount usage percentage, coupon redemptions, and conversion rates.  No functional changes were made between the two updates of this file.  The component also includes reusable components like `MetricsGroup`, `KeyMetricCard`, and `DiscountMetricCard` for displaying metrics.  There is also consistent use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements.

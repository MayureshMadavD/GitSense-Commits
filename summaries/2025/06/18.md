# Activity Summary for 18/06/2025

## 16:53:32
The log shows two commits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`, both within a minute of each other on June 18, 2025.  The changes are minor and pertain to the pagination settings within a Table component.

The first commit (16:21:06) renders the `Table` component without pagination (`pagination={false}`).

The second commit (16:22:55) modifies the `Table` component to include pagination, specifically setting `pagination={{ pageSize: 8, position: ['bottomRight'] }}`.  All other aspects of the component remain unchanged.  The code's overall structure, involving various analytics cards, charts (DiscountBarChart, Chart), and data fetching/processing functions, remains consistent throughout both commits.  The use of `AnalyticsCard`, `DiscountMetricCard`, and `DownloadIcon` components from a `gokwik-ui-kit` library suggests a consistent design pattern.  The code heavily uses data from `discountData`, which seems to be a prop containing various structured analytics information.


## 17:53:37
The log shows several code changes across two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing a React-based discount analytics dashboard.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`:** This file underwent two nearly identical updates within a short time frame (17:28:12 and 17:28:32). No substantive code changes are observable between these two commits.  The component renders various analytics cards, charts (`DiscountBarChart`, `Chart`), and tables using the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library. It retrieves and displays discount-related data, allowing users to filter and download data using options like `Select` components and a `DownloadIcon` component, which appears to require an API key. The displayed data is organized into sections:  metric cards, discount type overview, performance summary, discount usage trend, top discounts (used and failed), and a discount code-level overview.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`:** This file contains data definitions and configurations for charts and tables used within the analytics dashboard. It was updated multiple times (17:33:58, 17:35:26, 17:35:45, 17:37:15).  These changes involved refining the data structures, particularly `SummaryBlocksData` and `ChartRows`.  These structures define the data sources, display formats (e.g., `heroValueTransform: 'amount'`), and tooltip text for various metrics presented in the dashboard.  There's a recurring theme of handling data for both GoKwik and non-GoKwik orders. The `ChartRows` data structure organizes chart data by business and marketing metrics with different filters and formatting options.  The `checkoutFunnelFilters` function appears to dynamically construct filter options based on date ranges.  The consistent use of `realtimeStats`, `funnel`, `orderMetrics`, and `marketingMetrics` as data keys suggests a structured data retrieval process from a backend system.  There is also some commented-out code related to "Gokwik SSO" and COD metrics, indicating features that may be planned or under development.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative improvements and refinements to a React-based discount analytics dashboard, enhancing its data presentation, filtering capabilities, and data structures for improved user experience and maintainability. The frequent commits to `chartsData.tsx` suggest ongoing development and adjustments to the data model and presentation.


## 18:53:47
The log shows multiple updates to components related to discount analytics within a checkout dashboard UI.  The most significant changes occur between 17:58:46 and 18:52:39 on June 18, 2025.  These changes primarily affect `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`: This file undergoes minor revisions, mostly involving whitespace and formatting adjustments with no functional changes to the code.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx`: A crucial modification is made to the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function at 18:03:54.  This function now filters the `successBarChartData` to include only items where `discount_type` is "manual". This suggests a refinement in how manual discount data is handled.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`: This file undergoes a series of edits focused on improving the Chart component.  There are many updates over the period 18:01:58 to 18:52:39,  all related to refining the chart's data handling and visual representation.  A custom tooltip is added to handle multiple key values in the data, enhancing data display and clarifying the chart's presentation of the data. The modifications primarily involve enhancements to the custom tooltip functionality to display `discountUsage`, `couponRedemptions`, and `conversionCr` alongside dates for improved clarity.  No major structural changes are apparent, indicating iterative improvements rather than a complete overhaul.


The recurring theme across these changes is the improvement of data handling and presentation within the discount analytics section of the dashboard.  The small time gaps between some commits suggest an agile development approach with rapid iteration and testing.

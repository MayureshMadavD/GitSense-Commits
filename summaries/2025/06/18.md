# Activity Summary for 18/06/2025

## 16:53:32
The log shows two commits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`, both within a minute of each other on June 18, 2025.  The changes are minor and pertain to the pagination settings within a Table component.

The first commit (16:21:06) renders the `Table` component without pagination (`pagination={false}`).

The second commit (16:22:55) modifies the `Table` component to include pagination, specifically setting `pagination={{ pageSize: 8, position: ['bottomRight'] }}`.  All other aspects of the component remain unchanged.  The code's overall structure, involving various analytics cards, charts (DiscountBarChart, Chart), and data fetching/processing functions, remains consistent throughout both commits.  The use of `AnalyticsCard`, `DiscountMetricCard`, and `DownloadIcon` components from a `gokwik-ui-kit` library suggests a consistent design pattern.  The code heavily uses data from `discountData`, which seems to be a prop containing various structured analytics information.

The log shows several code changes across two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing a React-based discount analytics dashboard.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`:** This file underwent two nearly identical updates within a short time frame (17:28:12 and 17:28:32). No substantive code changes are observable between these two commits.  The component renders various analytics cards, charts (`DiscountBarChart`, `Chart`), and tables using the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library. It retrieves and displays discount-related data, allowing users to filter and download data using options like `Select` components and a `DownloadIcon` component, which appears to require an API key. The displayed data is organized into sections:  metric cards, discount type overview, performance summary, discount usage trend, top discounts (used and failed), and a discount code-level overview.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`:** This file contains data definitions and configurations for charts and tables used within the analytics dashboard. It was updated multiple times (17:33:58, 17:35:26, 17:35:45, 17:37:15).  These changes involved refining the data structures, particularly `SummaryBlocksData` and `ChartRows`.  These structures define the data sources, display formats (e.g., `heroValueTransform: 'amount'`), and tooltip text for various metrics presented in the dashboard.  There's a recurring theme of handling data for both GoKwik and non-GoKwik orders. The `ChartRows` data structure organizes chart data by business and marketing metrics with different filters and formatting options.  The `checkoutFunnelFilters` function appears to dynamically construct filter options based on date ranges.  The consistent use of `realtimeStats`, `funnel`, `orderMetrics`, and `marketingMetrics` as data keys suggests a structured data retrieval process from a backend system.  There is also some commented-out code related to "Gokwik SSO" and COD metrics, indicating features that may be planned or under development.


In summary, the code changes reflect iterative improvements and refinements to a React-based discount analytics dashboard, enhancing its data presentation, filtering capabilities, and data structures for improved user experience and maintainability. The frequent commits to `chartsData.tsx` suggest ongoing development and adjustments to the data model and presentation.

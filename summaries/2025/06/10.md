# Activity Summary for 10/06/2025

## 15:32:52
The log shows several code changes across two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/styles/styles.css` file also underwent multiple updates.

The `discountAnalytics.tsx` file was updated multiple times on October 6th, 2025.  The most significant change between the first and last versions is the addition of `gutter={[16,16]}` to the `<Row>` element that wraps the bar charts, likely impacting the spacing and layout of the charts.  These modifications to the `discountAnalytics.tsx` file primarily focus on refining the visual presentation of discount analytics data within the UI, involving modifications to selectors, tables, and charts.  There's a consistent pattern of displaying last update timestamps for various data sections.

The `chart.tsx` file was also updated multiple times on October 6th, 2025, with no substantive changes across the multiple updates.  This component handles the rendering of various chart types, and the modifications appear to be primarily minor adjustments or bug fixes. The updates focus on chart configuration and rendering, using a library like `ReactApexChart`.  The component includes logic to handle multiple key-value pairs in the data, suggesting flexibility in data representation for different charts.


The `styles.css` file was updated multiple times on October 6th, 2025.  These updates seem to focus on styling various UI elements (Ant Design components and ApexCharts), primarily related to the appearance of tables, charts, menus, and date pickers. A notable change is the commenting out of a rule affecting x-axis labels in bar charts, possibly related to layout adjustments or fixing a styling issue.  The updates throughout the day show incremental refinement of visual styles, especially those related to the `checkout-analytics` class.  The last update removed a CSS rule that controlled the display of last x-axis labels in bar charts.

The log shows two entries for `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/styles/styles.css`, both at approximately 15:40 on October 6th, 2025.  The changes between these two entries are minimal, if any â€“ the content appears to be identical.  The stylesheet uses Tailwind CSS (`@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`) and styles various elements using class names suggesting an Ant Design (`.ant-table`, `.ant-picker`, `.ant-menu`, etc.) and ApexCharts (`.apexcharts-legend`, `.apexcharts-text`) integration.  The styles cover aspects like table overflow, date picker formatting, chart legend styling, menu item appearance, and custom segmented control styling. There are no apparent patterns in additions or deletions of code between the two entries.

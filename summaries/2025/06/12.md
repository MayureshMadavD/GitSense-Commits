# Activity Summary for 12/06/2025

## 13:20:37
The provided code logs show modifications to two primary files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts`.  There's also a log entry for `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` underwent multiple revisions between 12/06/2025, 12:34:10 and 12:04:21.  These revisions primarily involved refinements to the `callShippingDiscountApi` and `processShippingDiscountResponse` functions.  The changes focus on handling different API responses, particularly error states and scenarios related to shipping options and discount application.  Specific improvements include more robust error handling,  updated logic for handling gift cards during cart updates (CHECKOUT-15842), and adjustments for payment method calls (CHECKOUT-12982).  The addition of confetti effects upon successful coupon application is also notable.  The core functionality of fetching shipping discounts and processing the responses remains consistent, but the error handling and edge-case management are significantly enhanced.  The changes suggest a focus on improving the user experience and application stability in the checkout process.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts` shows a single update at 12/06/2025, 12:57:50. This update involves expanding the number of Svelte stores defined within the file.  These stores manage various aspects of the application state, including cart information (`store_cartjsObject`, `store_originalCartjsObject`), user information (`store_requestIdObject`, `store_merchantInfo`), UI elements (`snackbar_state`, `store_loader`, `store_fullScreenPopUp`), and various flags and configurations.  The addition of these stores suggests an expansion of the application's functionality or a restructuring of its state management.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` shows a single log entry at 12/06/2025, 12:59:00. This file contains various asynchronous functions interacting with a merchant API.  It includes functions for retrieving cart data, managing requests, handling user experiments, and performing various actions related to login, address management, and OTP verification. The code extensively uses Svelte stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` for data management.  The inclusion of error handling and logging mechanisms suggests a focus on robust API interaction and error management within the application.  The presence of functions to handle  `customFit` and `bik` pixels suggests integration with external analytics platforms or custom tracking solutions.

The log shows a single code change to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/payment/codLimits.tsx` on 12/06/2025 at 12:30:04.  This file is a React component (`CodLimits`) that allows setting upper and lower limits for Cash on Delivery (COD) payments.  The component uses a form with two input fields (`cod_lower_limit` and `cod_limit`) for these limits,  validated to ensure the lower limit is less than or equal to the upper limit.  The component fetches and saves configuration using `useMerchantConfigApi`, which interacts with an API endpoint (`APIEndPoints.updateDiscountConfig`).  An informational alert directs users to related "Kwik Flows" settings.  The code utilizes several components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and custom hooks and helper functions from the `@library` directory.


## 14:28:58
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` between 13:41:11 and 14:15:22 on December 6, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function.  The function processes discount analytics data, transforming it into various formats for display (cards, tables, charts).  Specific modifications include adjustments to data mapping within `useMemo` calls, altering which keys are accessed from the input `data` object.  For example, the index used to access data within `discountAnalyticsData` array changed multiple times for different parts of the function.  There are also several additions of `console.log` statements to aid debugging.  The initial state of `selectedDiscountType` in `setDiscountTypeOverviewData` changed from `discount` to `Discounts` and then back to `discount`.  Furthermore, a `console.log` statement was added and then later removed within the `setDiscountTypeOverviewData` and `getDiscountAnalyticsData` functions respectively.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/analytics/api.ts` was updated at 13:47:53 on December 6, 2025. This update involved modifications to the `analyticsAPIs` object, which defines API endpoints for various analytics data.  Some API endpoints were commented out (`vdOrderMetrics`, `vdFunnelMetrics`, `vdCodShare`, `vdCodRTORate`), and existing endpoints underwent data formatting adjustments within their associated `formatData` functions. The `fetchAnalyticsData` function was added to fetch data from the APIs defined in `analyticsAPIs`.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/analytics/index.ts` received a single update at 13:48:14 on December 6, 2025. This change introduced Redux logic for managing analytics data, using `createAsyncThunk` for asynchronous API calls and `createSlice` for state management. The reducer handles pending, fulfilled, and rejected states for fetched analytics data, appropriately updating the Redux store.  The `initialState` is heavily structured and reflects the data structure received from the APIs.


Finally, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` was updated at 14:17:08 and 14:26:28 on December 6, 2025.  These updates appear to be focused on improving the UI related to Discount Analytics.  The changes involve adding or modifying UI elements (Select, Input) and updating the rendering logic to display the data from `getDiscountAnalyticsData`. The second update at 14:26:28 likely included minor UI refinements or bug fixes.

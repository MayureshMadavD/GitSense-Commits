# Activity Summary for 17/06/2025

## 00:16:54
The log shows a single entry for `/Users/madav/Downloads/ss/index.html` at 23:57:46 on June 16th, 2025.  This file is an HTML document displaying a table summarizing data. The table presents discount usage percentage, coupon redemptions, and coupon conversion rates (CR%) for two periods, identified as "primaryDate" and "secondaryDate".  The data is dynamically inserted using JavaScript expressions like `${primaryDate}`, `${discountUsagePrimary}`, etc.  The HTML utilizes inline styling to create a visually formatted table with colored indicators for each date.  The styling is consistent, suggesting a deliberate design choice for presentation.


## 00:43:46
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` between June 16th, 23:46 and June 17th, 00:40.  The changes primarily focus on improving the `Chart` component's functionality and styling.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` Changes:**

* **June 16th, 23:46:04:** Initial commit of the `Chart` component,  `MetricsGroup`, `KeyMetricCard`, and `DiscountMetricCard` components. The `Chart` component renders an Apex chart based on provided props.  The tooltip functionality is rudimentary.

* **June 16th, 23:53:59:** Added `dayjs` library for date formatting, improving the date display within the chart's tooltip.

* **June 16th, 23:55:46:** Minor styling adjustments to the tooltip, adding `display:flex;flex-direction:row;gap:2;align-items:center;` to the `th` elements for better layout.

* **June 16th, 23:56:58:** Further refinement of tooltip styling, adding an extra `div` around the date in each `th`.

* **June 17th, 00:00:18:**  Attempted to add inline styles `display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 2px; justify-content: center;` to `th` elements within the tooltip, likely aiming for improved alignment.  The syntax was incorrect.

* **June 17th, 00:00:30:** Another attempt at correcting the tooltip `th` styling, the syntax was still incorrect.

* **June 17th, 00:04:52:** Corrected the inline styling in the tooltip's `th` elements, using `<div style="display: flex; ...">` correctly.  Added padding to table cells for improved readability.

* **June 17th, 00:08:02:** Changed the tooltip's `return` statement from a template literal using backticks (`) to a template literal using backticks (`) to avoid unnecessary string concatenation. Also updated spacing and margin.

* **June 17th, 00:09:38:** Added `text-align: center` styling to the tooltip's `th` elements for better date alignment.  Padding adjustments continued.

* **June 17th, 00:23:09:** Removed unused import `formatNumber` and `formatLastUpdateAt` from the file.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` Changes:**

* **June 17th, 00:13:24:**  This file contains various utility functions for the analytics component. The most significant change was adding a `SectionHeader` component that includes download functionality using `downloadToCSV`.  The `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function processes and transforms discount data according to a configuration (`DISCOUNT_ANALYTICS_CONFIG`).

* **June 17th, 00:22:33:** Removed unused import `Tooltip` and `InfoCircleOutlined` from this file.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` Changes:**

* **June 17th, 00:21:31:** This component renders the discount analytics section.  It uses the functions and components from `chart.tsx` and `commonFunctions.tsx` to display various charts and tables.  Significant updates include filter functionality for discount type and sub-type, as well as search functionality in the bifurcation table.

* **June 17th, 00:23:21:** Removed unused import `formatLastUpdateAt`


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` Changes:**

* **June 17th, 00:23:02:** This helper file contains various utility functions, including formatting functions (`formatAmount`, `formatNumberInCurrency`, `formatDateString`) and data manipulation functions (`sortDataByKey`, `extractTitlesAndDataIndexes`).


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` Changes:**

* **June 17th, 00:40:31:** This file defines configurations for charts and tables used in the discount analytics screen, including filter options and column definitions.

* Consistent use of functional components and hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useMemo`).
* Frequent updates related to tooltip styling and formatting.
* Data transformation and manipulation using helper functions.
* Download functionality implemented in multiple places.


The overall pattern suggests iterative development, with a focus on improving the user interface and data presentation in the discount analytics section of the dashboard.  The numerous minor revisions to `chart.tsx` indicate a concentration on refining the tooltip's appearance and formatting.


## 01:16:55
The log shows modifications to `/Users/madav/Downloads/ss/index.html`.  The file is an HTML document displaying key-value pairs within divs styled for horizontal alignment.

The first significant change occurred at 00:49:59 on 17/06/2025.  This update added two more key-value pairs to the page, increasing the number of divs from one to three.  Each div uses inline styling with mostly consistent spacing and styling.  Note there is a small variation in the spacing around `display:flex;` between the first commit and the others.

At 00:51:23, the file was modified again to revert to a single key-value pair,  combining the `key` and `:` into a single div element.

Finally, at 00:51:37, another modification added a second key-value pair back into the HTML, resulting in a similar structure to the version at 00:51:23, but with a second key-value pair.  The changes primarily involve adding and removing key-value pairs and minor adjustments to the inline styling within the divs.  The overall structure of the HTML remained relatively consistent throughout these updates.


## 01:43:41
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` between 00:48:03 and 01:35:18 on June 17, 2025.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` file underwent significant changes related to chart rendering and tooltip functionality.  The most substantial changes involve the addition and refinement of a custom tooltip for charts with multiple data series (`multiKeyValue`). This tooltip displays detailed information including "Discount Usage %," "Coupon Redemptions," and "Coupon CR%," formatted for clarity.  Several minor revisions to this file seem to be focused on code style or minor adjustments, possibly addressing bugs or improving readability, rather than introducing new functionalities.  There are no timestamp patterns, suggesting edits were not done in a batch.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` file was modified to define data structures and configurations for charts, focusing on the organization and presentation of analytics data.  The updates are largely concerned with enhancing the structure and content of various data objects  (`SummaryBlocksData`, `SummaryBlocksDataSources`, `ChartRows`), which are used to populate different sections of the dashboard with metrics and data visualizations.  These changes involved adding, removing, and modifying elements within these structures, primarily to include new metrics or adjust display formats, with the final change at 01:35:18 adjusting the formatting of the "Coupon CR%" within the custom tooltip function from the `chart.tsx` file. Again, no timestamp patterns are observed.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` shows a single revision at 00:44:04 on June 17, 2025.  This file appears to be the main component responsible for displaying the discount analytics dashboard, utilizing components and functions defined in the other two files. The code demonstrates the use of the 'gokwik-ui-kit' component library for UI elements, data fetching functions, and chart rendering to display various discount-related metrics.


## 11:58:43
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` file.  All revisions on June 17th, 2025, involve updates to the  `DiscountMetricCard` component's styling.


The first revision (02:03:23) establishes the initial component structure, including `Chart`, `MetricsGroup`, `KeyMetricCard`, and `DiscountMetricCard` components.  `Chart` is a React component that renders charts using `ReactApexChart` based on provided data and configuration.  It handles various chart types and includes options for comparisons and custom tooltips. The `MetricsGroup` component displays a group of metrics, handling cases where KwikPass integration is missing. `KeyMetricCard` and `DiscountMetricCard` display individual metrics with styling based on selection state.

Subsequent revisions (11:41:28, 11:44:51, and 11:45:45) focus solely on minor styling changes within the `DiscountMetricCard` component.  The border style of this component is adjusted: initially, it seems to have a `border-gray-500` style which gets changed to `border-gray-300` and lastly to  `border-gray-500` again,  but with a `style={{border:'1px solid gray'}}` inline style added in the second-to-last revision and then changed to `style={{border:'1px solid #d1d5db'}}` in the last revision.  These changes suggest iterative refinements to the visual appearance of the card.  No functional changes are apparent in the code across these revisions.


## 12:58:41
The provided code consists of a single file, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx`, which was modified twice on June 17th, 2025.  The changes are minor and focus primarily on logging within the `DownloadIcon` component.

The first revision (12:48:09) contains the initial version of the code, which includes functions for triggering downloads, rendering UI elements (DownloadIcon and KwikCodLock), data manipulation (checkKeys, getUniqueOptions, fetchAllAnalyticsData, setDiscountTypeOverviewData, useDiscountBifurcationData, getDiscountAnalyticsData), and navigation (redirectToReport).

The second revision (12:49:59) introduces a `console.log` statement within the `DownloadIcon` component's `onClick` handler, adding a log of the `formattedDates` variable. This suggests a debugging or logging addition to aid in development or troubleshooting.  No other functional changes to the codebase are apparent.  The core functionality of data fetching, processing, and UI rendering remains the same.


## 13:58:49
The log shows multiple revisions to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory between 13:16 and 13:45 on June 17, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `discountAnalytics.tsx` component and its associated `commonFunctions.tsx` file.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` underwent several revisions.  The core functionality remained consistent—rendering discount analytics data within an Ant Design-styled dashboard. Key changes include modifications to the `DownloadIcon` props, specifically the `apiKey` prop values which changed from  `discountStats` to `discountCouponStats` in multiple places between 13:19 and 13:23.  Additionally, a `params` prop was added to `DownloadIcon` in one of the 'Top Discount Used' sections (around 13:21) to add a parameter for discount type.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` was also modified.  A minor change in the `DownloadIcon` component around 13:17 and a more significant change at 13:27-13:28 improved the handling of the `params` prop, making it optional and using the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) for better default value handling. This suggests an improvement in the robustness of download functionality.  The rest of the file remained largely unchanged, indicating that core data fetching and manipulation functions were already stable.

The pattern across changes suggests a focus on enhancing the download functionality and making the code more robust and readable.  The series of edits in `discountAnalytics.tsx` might reflect iterative improvements to API calls or data presentation related to discount analytics. The changes to `commonFunctions.tsx` further solidify this by refining parameter handling in the download function.


## 15:58:41
The log shows updates to two files on June 17, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated at 15:52:37. This file contains functions to determine base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestion, main API, experiment, twidpay, kp, analytics) and CDN paths based on the current environment (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The code extensively uses conditional logic to switch URLs based on the environment variable `env`.  It also defines functions to retrieve and set specific tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) differing across environments. A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with sample data.  The logic suggests a multi-environment deployment strategy with different API endpoints for each stage.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 15:52:54. This file is an HTML merchant page.  It includes a button triggering a `goKwikCheckout` function which sends `merchantInfo` via a `window.postMessage` call. The `merchantInfo` object contains details like merchant ID (`mid`), app ID, app secret, store ID, and Facebook pixel ID. The environment is set to `local`.  The script dynamically loads a gokwik.js script from `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js`  in the local environment, demonstrating a development setup.  Cookie management for `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` is also implemented.  The page also contains commented-out code for potentially loading analytics scripts from a different domain and a commented section with multiple different `mid` values, suggesting potential testing across different merchant accounts or environments.

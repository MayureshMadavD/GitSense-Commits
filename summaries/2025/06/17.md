# Activity Summary for 17/06/2025

## 00:16:54
The log shows a single entry for `/Users/madav/Downloads/ss/index.html` at 23:57:46 on June 16th, 2025.  This file is an HTML document displaying a table summarizing data. The table presents discount usage percentage, coupon redemptions, and coupon conversion rates (CR%) for two periods, identified as "primaryDate" and "secondaryDate".  The data is dynamically inserted using JavaScript expressions like `${primaryDate}`, `${discountUsagePrimary}`, etc.  The HTML utilizes inline styling to create a visually formatted table with colored indicators for each date.  The styling is consistent, suggesting a deliberate design choice for presentation.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` between June 16th, 23:46 and June 17th, 00:40.  The changes primarily focus on improving the `Chart` component's functionality and styling.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` Changes:**

* **June 16th, 23:46:04:** Initial commit of the `Chart` component,  `MetricsGroup`, `KeyMetricCard`, and `DiscountMetricCard` components. The `Chart` component renders an Apex chart based on provided props.  The tooltip functionality is rudimentary.

* **June 16th, 23:53:59:** Added `dayjs` library for date formatting, improving the date display within the chart's tooltip.

* **June 16th, 23:55:46:** Minor styling adjustments to the tooltip, adding `display:flex;flex-direction:row;gap:2;align-items:center;` to the `th` elements for better layout.

* **June 16th, 23:56:58:** Further refinement of tooltip styling, adding an extra `div` around the date in each `th`.

* **June 17th, 00:00:18:**  Attempted to add inline styles `display: flex; align-items: center; gap: 2px; justify-content: center;` to `th` elements within the tooltip, likely aiming for improved alignment.  The syntax was incorrect.

* **June 17th, 00:00:30:** Another attempt at correcting the tooltip `th` styling, the syntax was still incorrect.

* **June 17th, 00:04:52:** Corrected the inline styling in the tooltip's `th` elements, using `<div style="display: flex; ...">` correctly.  Added padding to table cells for improved readability.

* **June 17th, 00:08:02:** Changed the tooltip's `return` statement from a template literal using backticks (`) to a template literal using backticks (`) to avoid unnecessary string concatenation. Also updated spacing and margin.

* **June 17th, 00:09:38:** Added `text-align: center` styling to the tooltip's `th` elements for better date alignment.  Padding adjustments continued.

* **June 17th, 00:23:09:** Removed unused import `formatNumber` and `formatLastUpdateAt` from the file.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` Changes:**

* **June 17th, 00:13:24:**  This file contains various utility functions for the analytics component. The most significant change was adding a `SectionHeader` component that includes download functionality using `downloadToCSV`.  The `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function processes and transforms discount data according to a configuration (`DISCOUNT_ANALYTICS_CONFIG`).

* **June 17th, 00:22:33:** Removed unused import `Tooltip` and `InfoCircleOutlined` from this file.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` Changes:**

* **June 17th, 00:21:31:** This component renders the discount analytics section.  It uses the functions and components from `chart.tsx` and `commonFunctions.tsx` to display various charts and tables.  Significant updates include filter functionality for discount type and sub-type, as well as search functionality in the bifurcation table.

* **June 17th, 00:23:21:** Removed unused import `formatLastUpdateAt`


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` Changes:**

* **June 17th, 00:23:02:** This helper file contains various utility functions, including formatting functions (`formatAmount`, `formatNumberInCurrency`, `formatDateString`) and data manipulation functions (`sortDataByKey`, `extractTitlesAndDataIndexes`).


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` Changes:**

* **June 17th, 00:40:31:** This file defines configurations for charts and tables used in the discount analytics screen, including filter options and column definitions.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Extensive use of React components from the `gokwik-ui-kit`.
* Consistent use of functional components and hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useMemo`).
* Frequent updates related to tooltip styling and formatting.
* Data transformation and manipulation using helper functions.
* Download functionality implemented in multiple places.


The overall pattern suggests iterative development, with a focus on improving the user interface and data presentation in the discount analytics section of the dashboard.  The numerous minor revisions to `chart.tsx` indicate a concentration on refining the tooltip's appearance and formatting.


## 01:16:55
The log shows modifications to `/Users/madav/Downloads/ss/index.html`.  The file is an HTML document displaying key-value pairs within divs styled for horizontal alignment.

The first significant change occurred at 00:49:59 on 17/06/2025.  This update added two more key-value pairs to the page, increasing the number of divs from one to three.  Each div uses inline styling with mostly consistent spacing and styling.  Note there is a small variation in the spacing around `display:flex;` between the first commit and the others.

At 00:51:23, the file was modified again to revert to a single key-value pair,  combining the `key` and `:` into a single div element.

Finally, at 00:51:37, another modification added a second key-value pair back into the HTML, resulting in a similar structure to the version at 00:51:23, but with a second key-value pair.  The changes primarily involve adding and removing key-value pairs and minor adjustments to the inline styling within the divs.  The overall structure of the HTML remained relatively consistent throughout these updates.

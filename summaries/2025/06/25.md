# Activity Summary for 25/06/2025

## 11:24:16
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` between 22:37:10 and 22:55:17 on June 24, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor adjustments and bug fixes, primarily focusing on the filtering logic within the `fetchData` function, specifically how it handles filtering products based on the `isAgentLed` flag and the `tags` field.  The changes involved altering how the tags are split and checked to remove items with 'no-agent' tag. There were no substantial structural changes to the component.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/website-analytics/index.tsx` underwent several revisions between 10:42:45 and 11:06:30 on June 25, 2025.  These revisions involved improvements to the layout and UI using the `Col` component to adjust the layout, particularly the date picker and segmented control placement, improving the visual organization of the page.  The gutter spacing in the `Row` component was also adjusted.  Functionality remained largely consistent, with updates focused on minor UI/UX elements and logEvent calls for tracking user interactions.  A significant change was made around 11:04:04 reducing the gutter from `[0, 24]` to `[0, 18]`.  The Segmented control was moved into a separate `Col` component at approximately 11:06:16.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` was modified multiple times between 10:53:28 and 11:09:43 on June 25, 2025.  These changes primarily involved additions and refinements to the analytics dashboard.  The updates included introducing functionality for downloading data (`triggerDownload`), handling different sales channels (`salesChannelOptions`, `globalFilters`), and enhancing the display of summary blocks (`blocksData`, `blocksDataFromSources`).  The `KwikCodLock` component indicates conditional rendering based on KYC status.  These changes significantly expanded the functionality and display of the analytics dashboard.  A considerable amount of refactoring occurred, with multiple minor adjustments for styling and error handling.

# Activity Summary for 25/06/2025

## 11:24:16
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` between 22:37:10 and 22:55:17 on June 24, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor adjustments and bug fixes, primarily focusing on the filtering logic within the `fetchData` function, specifically how it handles filtering products based on the `isAgentLed` flag and the `tags` field.  The changes involved altering how the tags are split and checked to remove items with 'no-agent' tag. There were no substantial structural changes to the component.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/website-analytics/index.tsx` underwent several revisions between 10:42:45 and 11:06:30 on June 25, 2025.  These revisions involved improvements to the layout and UI using the `Col` component to adjust the layout, particularly the date picker and segmented control placement, improving the visual organization of the page.  The gutter spacing in the `Row` component was also adjusted.  Functionality remained largely consistent, with updates focused on minor UI/UX elements and logEvent calls for tracking user interactions.  A significant change was made around 11:04:04 reducing the gutter from `[0, 24]` to `[0, 18]`.  The Segmented control was moved into a separate `Col` component at approximately 11:06:16.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` was modified multiple times between 10:53:28 and 11:09:43 on June 25, 2025.  These changes primarily involved additions and refinements to the analytics dashboard.  The updates included introducing functionality for downloading data (`triggerDownload`), handling different sales channels (`salesChannelOptions`, `globalFilters`), and enhancing the display of summary blocks (`blocksData`, `blocksDataFromSources`).  The `KwikCodLock` component indicates conditional rendering based on KYC status.  These changes significantly expanded the functionality and display of the analytics dashboard.  A considerable amount of refactoring occurred, with multiple minor adjustments for styling and error handling.


## 15:24:14
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`.  The updates span from 14:30:51 to 15:19:10 on June 25, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`: This file, a Svelte component, underwent two major revisions.  The first (14:30:51) introduces a significant amount of code focusing on handling merchant information, analytics calls (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics), cookie management, and conditional rendering based on environment and device type. The second revision (15:19:10) appears to be minor and doesn't significantly alter the functionality established in the first update.  Both updates involve extensive use of Javascript and Typescript, managing various states, handling events, and interacting with numerous third-party analytics platforms.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`: This file, a Typescript module, handles foreign analytics integration. It primarily focuses on subscribing to various Svelte stores to collect data and dispatch events to various analytics platforms (Facebook, Google Analytics, Snapchat etc.) based on the configuration stored in `configObject`. Several updates occurred between 14:35:14 and 14:58:11. These updates refined the logic for data aggregation, mapping, and event dispatching.  The changes show iterative improvements to the handling of various analytics parameters and configurations derived from Svelte stores.  Specifically, there's a focus on how UTM parameters, discount codes, and other order details are processed and sent to the respective analytics systems.  The code extensively uses subscriptions to Svelte stores, indicating a reactive approach to data management.  The final change (14:58:11) appears to be a minor correction or refinement, with no significant changes in functionality from previous updates.

A recurring pattern is the extensive use of analytics integrations and a reactive approach leveraging Svelte stores within both files.  The updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts` directly reflect changes made to the analytics parameters used within `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`.  The updates consistently involve additions and refinements to the handling of analytics data.  There's an obvious intent to provide comprehensive analytics tracking across numerous platforms.


## 23:30:08
The log shows several code changes across three files between 22:44 and 23:01 on June 25, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/OfferBanner.svelte` was modified three times.  The core functionality remains consistent:  a Svelte component displaying an offer banner based on configuration data (`reqIdObject.custom_config`). The banner's appearance (background color, text color, and content) is dynamically determined by the current page and configuration.  The most significant change between the first and subsequent versions is a minor update to the `.offer-strip` CSS class, changing `background-color` to `background` in the style attribute of the div element, and changing the background-color property in the style section to background.  This likely improves the styling consistency.  This file also consistently uses `fireGtmEvent` to track banner loading.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated once. This file is an HTML page likely representing a merchant integration.  It includes JavaScript code to handle communication with a GoKwik SDK (`gokwikSdk`), setting cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), and posting merchant information (`merchantInfo`) which includes sensitive data (mid, appid, appsecret). Note that this file has been excluded from this analysis as a security precaution as this may contain sensitive information.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was modified once. This TypeScript file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs based on the current environment (`env`).  It handles multiple environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production, and several variations) and sets up default configurations when env is 'local'. The functions demonstrate significant logic to determine appropriate URLs for different API endpoints (health, address suggestions, etc.). There is also logic for setting up a cart object and request ID based on the environment.  A noticeable pattern is the extensive use of conditional statements to handle various environment-specific configurations.

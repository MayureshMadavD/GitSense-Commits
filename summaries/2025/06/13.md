# Activity Summary for 13/06/2025

## 15:43:05
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` on June 13th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent several revisions between 15:18:49 and 15:31:34.  These changes primarily involved modifications to the `api_url` function, adding and updating URLs for various environments ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and others).  The `local` environment's URL was changed multiple times within this period, eventually settling on  `https://qa-core-api.dev.gokwik.in`.  The `setCart` function was also modified, updating the cart object with different product details and a new token in the second and third update .


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 15:31:10. This update added a significant amount of JavaScript code to handle merchant information, including functions for initializing the Gokwik SDK, processing payments, handling events, and managing cookies related to landing pages and referrer URLs.  It also includes a commented-out section for loading the Gokwik modal script and analytics js. The  `merchantInfo` object contains various merchant details,  including `mid`, `environment`, and other parameters.  Importantly,  it sets the environment to `'local'`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` was updated twice, at 15:34:45 and 15:35:25. The changes are extensive and primarily focus on handling discounts, coupons, and offers.  The code manages various aspects of discount application, including interactions with multiple stores, handling of one-click coupons, and applying different types of discounts (e.g., exact, min, max). The updates refine the handling of one-click coupons and add logging for debugging purposes.  The code extensively uses Svelte stores for managing state.  A significant amount of logic deals with the application and management of multiple discounts, including constraints and priorities.  The second update includes a `console.log` statement added to output `shopifyAvailableOffers` which indicates debugging efforts.


## 16:43:03
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated twice on June 13th, 2025, at 16:20:10 and 16:20:18.  The changes appear minor and likely related to debugging or configuration. The second update shows a change in the `local` environment  `api_url`  from commented-out options to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`. The file defines functions to generate URLs for various API endpoints and services based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  It heavily uses conditional logic to select appropriate URLs for different environments.  The code also includes functions to retrieve and set cookies, suggesting some client-side state management.  There's a significant amount of conditional logic based on the `env` variable, determining the base URL for various services (health check, address suggestions, APIs, analytics, etc.).  Several functions (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) return different tokens based on the environment.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated once on June 13th, 2025, at 16:20:54.  This file is an HTML page that appears to integrate with the Gokwik payment gateway.  It includes a button triggering a `goKwikCheckout` function, which sends `merchantInfo` via a `postMessage` to likely a parent window or iframe. The `merchantInfo` object contains data such as `mid`, `environment`, `storeId`, etc.  The script dynamically loads the `gokwik.js` script, handling different URLs based on the environment.  It also manages cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to track user navigation.  The code suggests the integration manages different environments (local, QA, sandbox, production) and includes commented-out code indicating earlier attempts at different configurations.  There's also a commented-out analytics script and dynamically added script, implying potential A/B testing or dynamic analytics implementation.


## 17:43:34
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout` project across several files.  The most significant changes relate to the  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file and the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/payment/codLimits.tsx` file.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`: This file, a server-side rendered EJS template,  undergoes multiple revisions throughout the log. The changes consistently modify the  `systemjs-importmap` script tag's contents. This script tag dynamically defines module import paths based on the `deployedEnv` variable (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The changes primarily involve switching the URLs for various "@gokwik" modules between local development URLs (`//localhost:9000`, `//localhost:9002`) and various  `dev.gokwik.in` and `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` URLs, reflecting a shift between different deployment environments.  The final update at 17:34:39  sets the `@gokwik/utilities`  URL to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` for the `isLocal` and `qa` environments.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/payment/codLimits.tsx`: This React component, responsible for setting COD limits, has several updates, primarily focused on the `removeError` function and the `onFinish` handler within the form.  The initial version (16:45:51) includes the `Object.fromEntries` transformation on submitted form values before sending them to `saveConfig`. Subsequent revisions (16:56:24, 17:10:55, 17:11:32, 17:13:31, 17:13:52, 17:14:58, 17:16:36) modify the `removeError` function's logic for clearing form errors; specifically, the condition controlling error validation is refined several times, altering the circumstances under which validation is triggered.  A significant change is removing the unnecessary `Object.fromEntries` transformation in the `onFinish` handler (16:56:24) and then restoring it later (17:13:52). The final version reverts to the original logic of the `removeError` function.


The changes to both files occur within a relatively short timeframe (June 13th, 2025, between 16:43 and 17:34). The pattern observed suggests iterative development and debugging, with adjustments to the conditional logic in `removeError`, and changes in the import mapping to manage various deployment configurations.


## 19:43:04
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file underwent two significant updates on June 13th, 2025.  The first update at 17:46:14 involved adding configuration for various @gokwik packages, with URLs pointing to both localhost and different environments (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The localhost URLs (`//localhost:9000/gokwik-configuration.js`, `//localhost:9002/gokwik-checkout.js`) suggest a local development setup.  The other environments use URLs on `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` and `dev-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`. The production environment includes a conditional Clarity.ms script for analytics, and New Relic instrumentation.

The second update at 18:02:29 modified the URL for `@gokwik/utilities` in the `isLocal` block to point to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js`.  This change is potentially related to switching the local utility source to a QA environment source.

A recurring pattern is the extensive use of environment-specific URLs for different modules of the Gokwik dashboard. This suggests a microservices architecture where different components are deployed independently.  The code utilizes import maps for efficient dependency management in a single-spa setup.


## 20:43:08
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` project, primarily focusing on the `/src/pages/analytics/` directory.  Changes span from 20:29:00 to 20:40:36 on June 13, 2025.

The `/src/index.ejs` file was updated at 20:29:00. This file is an EJS template, likely handling different environment configurations (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production) by dynamically including different import maps.  The import maps specify URLs for various Gokwik modules (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, etc.), differing based on the environment.  Production builds also include Clarity.ms and New Relic scripts.


The `/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file underwent several revisions (20:32:04, 20:33:02, 20:34:55, 20:37:11). These changes primarily involve refinements to the `SectionHeader` component, adding tooltip functionality and improving the UI. There are also minor updates to the tooltip in the SectionHeader component. The `InfoCircleOutlined` icon is added to the tooltip in the latest update.


The `/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file was updated multiple times (20:33:41, 20:38:48, 20:39:02, 20:40:05, 20:40:31, 20:40:36).  These changes show iterative improvements to the UI presentation of discount analytics data. Tooltips were added for clarity and `TrendDataBarChart` was replaced with `DiscountBarChart` in one of the updates.  The most significant changes involve adding tooltips to various sections, improving the overall user experience by providing more information on hover.  There is also a consistent pattern of adding last updated timestamps for each section.  The component uses several custom components (`AnalyticsCard`, `DiscountMetricCard`, `Chart`, `TrendDataBarChart`, `SectionHeader`, `Table`), suggesting a well-structured component-based architecture.


## 21:43:09
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src` directory, specifically within the `pages/analytics` section.  The changes primarily involve refining the display and functionality of a discount analytics dashboard.

The `/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 20:45:31 and 20:50:14. These modifications focused on enhancing the user interface elements, improving data presentation, and adding tooltip descriptions for better clarity.  A notable change is the addition of `tooltipText` to the `DiscountBarChart` component at 20:48:06 and 20:48:48, providing more context to the bar chart data.  The `tooltipText` property was also added to the `SectionHeader` component at 20:50:14, further improving the user experience.

The `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` file was updated at 20:47:08, primarily focusing on the `Chart` component. This component handles the rendering of various chart types and its modifications likely involved improvements to data handling and presentation logic, based on the presence of  `multiKeyValue` for handling multiple data keys within the chart.

The `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` file saw modifications at 20:52:42, 20:54:19, and 21:23:39 and 21:25:10. These changes involved adjustments to data structures related to charts and tables displayed on the analytics dashboard.  These alterations were likely made to support new features or to correct errors related to data processing or display.  No significant structural changes are evident, but the constant updates suggest iterative improvements and refinements to the dashboard's data representation.

Finally, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file was modified at 20:59:22 and 21:26:15.  These changes likely involved adjustments to helper functions, such as data fetching, filtering, and data transformation.  The  `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function was modified at 21:26:15, fixing an error in the `discountUsageTrendData` retrieval by correctly referencing `discountAnalyticsData[2]` instead of `discountAnalyticsData[3]`. This indicates bug fixes and adjustments to data handling within the components.


Across all files, a recurring theme is the consistent use of `useMemo` and `useState` hooks, suggesting a React functional component architecture employing memoization for performance optimization. The frequent updates indicate iterative development with a focus on improving the user experience and the accuracy of the data displayed on the discount analytics dashboard.

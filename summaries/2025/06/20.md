# Activity Summary for 20/06/2025

## 10:11:19
The log shows several code changes across multiple files related to a checkout dashboard UI.  The main focus is on analytics, specifically checkout, website, and discount analytics.  Significant changes occurred between 09:31 and 09:59 on June 20, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` underwent two minor revisions. The most significant change was moving imports from `gokwik-ui-kit` to `@library/components`, indicating a refactoring of the project's component library structure.  This change happened between 09:31 and 09:32. A further minor change at 09:32 removed the `Button` import.  The file renders various analytics cards and tables related to discounts, utilizing several custom components and functions.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/checkoutAnalytics.tsx` shows a single entry at 09:34. This file renders checkout-related analytics using components like `FunnelChart`, `AnalyticsCard`, and `Table`.  The code displays multiple charts and metrics, providing a detailed overview of checkout performance.  The code includes conditional rendering based on the merchant's platform and configuration, particularly regarding Shopify.  There's also functionality for downloading reports and handling cases where KwikCodLock is displayed.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/websiteAnalytics.tsx` was updated once at 09:34. This file focuses on website analytics, showcasing key metrics and a funnel chart using components from `@library/components`. There's conditional rendering based on KwikPass integration, including an alert prompting users to install the app if it's not enabled.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` underwent several revisions during the logged period (09:35 to 10:05).  This file acts as the main entry point for analytics, dynamically rendering either checkout, website, or discount analytics based on the `currentScreen` state. It fetches data using `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, handles date range selection and comparison, and incorporates conditional rendering based on the merchant's configuration and the Shopify app integration status.  The major changes involved refactoring import paths to utilize `@library/components`, suggesting a modularization effort. The component also displays summary blocks (`blocksData` and `blocksDataFromSources`) with conditional rendering for KwikCodLock if necessary.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics-component/chart.tsx`  was updated multiple times (09:40 to 09:45).  These changes are primarily focused on refining the `Chart` component, improving its functionality and the custom tooltip functionality for displaying multiple key values. Notably, the custom tooltip now includes detailed information about discount usage, coupon redemptions, and conversion rates for both primary and secondary date ranges.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`  shows a single revision at 09:48. This file contains data structures and helper functions for charts, including filters for checkout funnels and data for summary blocks.  The changes appear minor, related to data organization and formatting.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` underwent revisions between 09:49 and 09:50. The file contains various helper functions, including formatting functions (`formatAmount`, `formatNumber`), date handling, and array comparison functions. The changes seem primarily focused on optimizing or clarifying the existing functions, removing `formatNumberInCurrency`  in the last change, and there was no significant addition or deletion of code, mostly changes for better readability and organization.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/analyticsHeader.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` were updated at 09:50 and 09:59 respectively.  The file displays a date range picker and sales channel selector.  The move from `src/pages` to `@library/components` mirrors the pattern observed in other components.  There were no significant functional changes but rather a change of the location where the code resides in the project.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/commonFunctions.tsx` had one update at 10:03. This file contains common functions used across the analytics components, such as download functionality (`triggerDownload`), report redirection (`redirectToReport`), and data fetching (`fetchAllAnalyticsData`). There were added functions for discount analytics data processing.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/datePicker.tsx` had one update at 10:04. This file contains a custom date picker component used for selecting date ranges in the analytics section.

The final change at 10:05 in `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` involved replacing the relative import path for `AnalyticsHeader` with a path referencing the `@library/components` directory. This change shows a consistent effort to refactor and organize the project's codebase into a more structured component library.


## 15:11:07
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file between 13:40:31 and 14:08:38 on June 20, 2025.  These revisions appear to involve refinements and additions to a React component responsible for editing order details, primarily focusing on functionality related to managing line items and discounts.  The code consistently uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and interacts with Redux for state management.  There are no substantial structural changes, but the code undergoes iterative improvements, likely addressing bugs or adding features.  The `useMemo` hook is extensively used for performance optimization.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated once at 13:23:23 on June 20, 2025. This update modifies the HTML structure, notably incorporating import maps for managing JavaScript modules,  Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for enhanced security, and conditional loading of different import maps based on the environment (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`). The production environment includes code snippets for clarity.ms and New Relic monitoring.  The conditional logic suggests the application supports multiple deployment environments.

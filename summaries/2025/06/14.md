# Activity Summary for 14/06/2025

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` between 22:43 and 23:27 on June 13, 2025.

The `commonFunctions.tsx` file underwent significant changes related to data processing and display of discount analytics.  Initial versions contained functions for triggering downloads (`triggerDownload`),  checking keys for chart permissions (`checkKeys`), redirecting to reports (`redirectToReport`), getting unique options (`getUniqueOptions`), fetching analytics data (`fetchAllAnalyticsData`),  setting discount type overview data (`setDiscountTypeOverviewData`), handling discount bifurcation data (`useDiscountBifurcationData`), and creating a section header (`SectionHeader`).  The `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function was heavily modified across multiple commits.  Initially it processed discount data into various chart data structures. Later revisions focused on refining the conditional logic within the `switch` statement within `getDiscountAnalyticsData` to handle different data structures and correctly populate fields like `discountTypeBifurcation` and `successBarChartData` based on the presence of 'code' and 'trendData' keys in the input data. This involved adding several `console.log` statements for debugging purposes, which were likely removed in later commits.  The changes aimed to improve data handling and organization for better chart rendering.


The `chartsData.tsx` file primarily involved modifications to the `ChartRows` constant, which defines the structure of charts and tables displayed in the analytics dashboard. Changes involved adding, removing, and modifying chart configurations, including their headings, data keys, tooltip text, and filtering options. These changes suggest iterative improvements to the dashboard's presentation and functionality, likely adding new charts or modifying existing ones.  The most significant change is the refactoring of the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function to use the `index` property in `DISCOUNT_ANALYTICS_CONFIG` instead of `dataPath`. This improves the code's readability and maintainability.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` was updated on 14/06/2025 at 10:59:04.  The update introduces several functions related to analytics data handling and presentation within a React application.

Key updates include:

* **Data fetching and processing:**  `fetchAllAnalyticsData` dispatches asynchronous actions to fetch analytics data based on specified parameters and ignores certain keys based on the current screen. `getDiscountAnalyticsData` transforms raw discount data into a structured format using a configuration array (`DISCOUNT_ANALYTICS_CONFIG`), applying transformations and handling fallback values.  `setDiscountTypeOverviewData` and `useDiscountBifurcationData` manage and filter discount data for display, using `useMemo` and `useState` for optimization and state management.  `getUniqueOptions` extracts unique values from data for dropdown options.

* **Data download functionality:** `triggerDownload` handles downloading data as a CSV file via an API call.  `DownloadIcon` provides a UI component for triggering the download.  `downloadToCSV` (called from `SectionHeader`) facilitates CSV downloads from processed data.

* **UI components:**  `DownloadIcon`, `KwikCodLock` (displays a lock icon and message when KYC is incomplete), and `SectionHeader` (a component for section headers with download functionality) are added, showcasing data using React components from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  `redirectToReport` handles navigation to a general reports page.

* **Data manipulation:** Functions like `checkKeys` verify the existence of specific keys, and `sortDataByKey` (imported but not shown in detail) likely performs sorting.

The code uses several libraries, including `react-redux`, `single-spa`, and custom utilities from `@gokwik/utilities` and `@library/utilities/helpers/helper`. A recurring pattern is the use of `useMemo` and `useState` hooks for efficient data management and UI updates. The code extensively handles error conditions and employs various utility functions for data transformations and processing.

# Activity Summary for 14/06/2025

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` between 22:43 and 23:27 on June 13, 2025.

The `commonFunctions.tsx` file underwent significant changes related to data processing and display of discount analytics.  Initial versions contained functions for triggering downloads (`triggerDownload`),  checking keys for chart permissions (`checkKeys`), redirecting to reports (`redirectToReport`), getting unique options (`getUniqueOptions`), fetching analytics data (`fetchAllAnalyticsData`),  setting discount type overview data (`setDiscountTypeOverviewData`), handling discount bifurcation data (`useDiscountBifurcationData`), and creating a section header (`SectionHeader`).  The `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function was heavily modified across multiple commits.  Initially it processed discount data into various chart data structures. Later revisions focused on refining the conditional logic within the `switch` statement within `getDiscountAnalyticsData` to handle different data structures and correctly populate fields like `discountTypeBifurcation` and `successBarChartData` based on the presence of 'code' and 'trendData' keys in the input data. This involved adding several `console.log` statements for debugging purposes, which were likely removed in later commits.  The changes aimed to improve data handling and organization for better chart rendering.


The `chartsData.tsx` file primarily involved modifications to the `ChartRows` constant, which defines the structure of charts and tables displayed in the analytics dashboard. Changes involved adding, removing, and modifying chart configurations, including their headings, data keys, tooltip text, and filtering options. These changes suggest iterative improvements to the dashboard's presentation and functionality, likely adding new charts or modifying existing ones.  The most significant change is the refactoring of the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function to use the `index` property in `DISCOUNT_ANALYTICS_CONFIG` instead of `dataPath`. This improves the code's readability and maintainability.

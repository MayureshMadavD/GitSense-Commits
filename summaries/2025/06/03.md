# Activity Summary for 03/06/2025

## 15:27:13
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx`, a React component rendering an analytics dashboard.  The primary changes revolve around data fetching and conditional rendering based on the `currentScreen` prop.

Initially (14:52:36), the component fetches analytics data based on date ranges and sales channels.  It handles different analytics screens ('checkout', 'website', 'discount') and includes conditional logic for displaying specific components (`CheckoutAnalytics`, `WebsiteAnalytics`, `DiscountAnalytics`).  A `showKwikCodLock` variable controls the display of a lock icon indicating restricted access to Kwik Checkout data.

A minor change at 14:53:50 adds a `console.log` statement for debugging the `funnelFilters` state.

Subsequent changes (14:57:08, 14:57:15, 14:58:51) involve minor modifications and debugging, primarily focused on refining the `useEffect` hook that fetches analytics data (`fetchAllAnalyticsData`).  These revisions adjust logging statements and slightly alter the `ignoreKeys` array passed to `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, changing which data points are excluded from the fetch based on the selected screen (Checkout, Website, Discount).

The revision at 15:01:04 refactors the data fetching logic within the main `useEffect` hook. The logic for ignoring specific keys based on the `currentScreen` is moved outside the if block for `currentScreen === 'checkout'` for better readability.  Additionally, it logs a slice of the `ignoreKeys` array.

The revision at 15:01:21 modifies the `ignoreKeys` slice in the `useEffect` hook for `website` and `discount` screens. A different set of keys is logged.

At 15:05:28, the `useEffect` responsible for fetching data is altered again.  For the 'website' screen, `ignoreKeys` now includes a combination of previously defined ignore keys and a slice of the `ignoreKeys` array, resulting in a more complex exclusion of data points in the fetch request depending on date ranges.

Further refinements are made to the same `useEffect` hook at 15:12:10, 15:15:42, 15:20:24, 15:21:13, 15:23:05, and 15:24:58. These primarily involve adjusting the conditional logic for different analytics screens, especially handling different `ignoreKeys` based on the `currentScreen` and date ranges. The primary focus is on ensuring the appropriate data is fetched and displayed depending on the selected screen and date ranges, with a notable addition of handling the 'discount' screen more explicitly in the `useEffect` hook at 15:15:42. The final revision at 15:24:58 adds `currentScreen` to the dependency array of the `useEffect` which fetches and updates analytics data.

A new file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` is introduced at 15:14:32. This file contains utility functions, including `triggerDownload` (for downloading analytics data), `DownloadIcon` (a React component for initiating downloads), `checkKeys` (for checking permissions), `KwikCodLock` (a lock icon component), and `redirectToReport` (for redirecting to a different report). `fetchAllAnalyticsData` handles dispatching redux actions to fetch analytics data based on the current screen and provided parameters, further defining which keys are ignored for different screens.

The overall pattern shows iterative development of the analytics dashboard, with a strong emphasis on handling various scenarios and refining the data fetching and display logic.  The frequent updates to the `index.tsx` file suggest a focus on improving the user experience and addressing edge cases.

The provided log shows two entries for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/websiteAnalytics.tsx`, both recorded on 03/06/2025.  The entries are identical; there were no code changes between the two timestamps (15:29:23 and 15:29:52).

The file `websiteAnalytics.tsx` is a React component responsible for displaying website analytics data.  The component fetches data using `useSelector` from a Redux store, specifically accessing data related to website funnels and their trends.  It uses several custom components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and a local library (`@library/components/funnel-chart`).  The UI is conditionally rendered based on whether KwikPass is enabled (`isKpEnabled`). If KwikPass is not enabled, a warning alert is displayed prompting the user to install the app.  The component displays key metrics, line graphs, business metrics, and a website conversion funnel chart, all dynamically updated based on selected metrics and fetched data.  The code uses `useMemo` extensively for performance optimization and `useEffect` to update the chart data when selected metrics change.  A `Popconfirm` component offers the user the choice between downloading a report with or without marketing parameters.

# Activity Summary for 03/06/2025

## 15:27:13
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx`, a React component rendering an analytics dashboard.  The primary changes revolve around data fetching and conditional rendering based on the `currentScreen` prop.

Initially (14:52:36), the component fetches analytics data based on date ranges and sales channels.  It handles different analytics screens ('checkout', 'website', 'discount') and includes conditional logic for displaying specific components (`CheckoutAnalytics`, `WebsiteAnalytics`, `DiscountAnalytics`).  A `showKwikCodLock` variable controls the display of a lock icon indicating restricted access to Kwik Checkout data.

A minor change at 14:53:50 adds a `console.log` statement for debugging the `funnelFilters` state.

Subsequent changes (14:57:08, 14:57:15, 14:58:51) involve minor modifications and debugging, primarily focused on refining the `useEffect` hook that fetches analytics data (`fetchAllAnalyticsData`).  These revisions adjust logging statements and slightly alter the `ignoreKeys` array passed to `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, changing which data points are excluded from the fetch based on the selected screen (Checkout, Website, Discount).

The revision at 15:01:04 refactors the data fetching logic within the main `useEffect` hook. The logic for ignoring specific keys based on the `currentScreen` is moved outside the if block for `currentScreen === 'checkout'` for better readability.  Additionally, it logs a slice of the `ignoreKeys` array.

The revision at 15:01:21 modifies the `ignoreKeys` slice in the `useEffect` hook for `website` and `discount` screens. A different set of keys is logged.

At 15:05:28, the `useEffect` responsible for fetching data is altered again.  For the 'website' screen, `ignoreKeys` now includes a combination of previously defined ignore keys and a slice of the `ignoreKeys` array, resulting in a more complex exclusion of data points in the fetch request depending on date ranges.

Further refinements are made to the same `useEffect` hook at 15:12:10, 15:15:42, 15:20:24, 15:21:13, 15:23:05, and 15:24:58. These primarily involve adjusting the conditional logic for different analytics screens, especially handling different `ignoreKeys` based on the `currentScreen` and date ranges. The primary focus is on ensuring the appropriate data is fetched and displayed depending on the selected screen and date ranges, with a notable addition of handling the 'discount' screen more explicitly in the `useEffect` hook at 15:15:42. The final revision at 15:24:58 adds `currentScreen` to the dependency array of the `useEffect` which fetches and updates analytics data.

A new file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` is introduced at 15:14:32. This file contains utility functions, including `triggerDownload` (for downloading analytics data), `DownloadIcon` (a React component for initiating downloads), `checkKeys` (for checking permissions), `KwikCodLock` (a lock icon component), and `redirectToReport` (for redirecting to a different report). `fetchAllAnalyticsData` handles dispatching redux actions to fetch analytics data based on the current screen and provided parameters, further defining which keys are ignored for different screens.

The overall pattern shows iterative development of the analytics dashboard, with a strong emphasis on handling various scenarios and refining the data fetching and display logic.  The frequent updates to the `index.tsx` file suggest a focus on improving the user experience and addressing edge cases.


## 16:26:26
The provided log shows two entries for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/websiteAnalytics.tsx`, both recorded on 03/06/2025.  The entries are identical; there were no code changes between the two timestamps (15:29:23 and 15:29:52).

The file `websiteAnalytics.tsx` is a React component responsible for displaying website analytics data.  The component fetches data using `useSelector` from a Redux store, specifically accessing data related to website funnels and their trends.  It uses several custom components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and a local library (`@library/components/funnel-chart`).  The UI is conditionally rendered based on whether KwikPass is enabled (`isKpEnabled`). If KwikPass is not enabled, a warning alert is displayed prompting the user to install the app.  The component displays key metrics, line graphs, business metrics, and a website conversion funnel chart, all dynamically updated based on selected metrics and fetched data.  The code uses `useMemo` extensively for performance optimization and `useEffect` to update the chart data when selected metrics change.  A `Popconfirm` component offers the user the choice between downloading a report with or without marketing parameters.


## 20:33:21
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`.

The `chart.tsx` file underwent several edits between 20:01:36 and 20:02:55, primarily focusing on the `DiscountMetricCard` component.  These changes involved refinements to its styling and the removal of the `onSelect` and `isSelected` props, simplifying its functionality.  The component now only displays discount metrics without interactive selection capabilities.  No significant logical changes were made to the chart rendering logic during this period.

The `discountAnalytics.tsx` file was modified extensively across multiple commits.  The most significant changes involve:

* **20:01:01:** Initial commit, setting up the component with various data structures (e.g., `cardObject`, `rawData`, `table3Data`) for displaying discount analytics.  This commit defined three tables for presenting different aspects of discount data.  The data is statically defined within the component, suggesting a future implementation involving dynamic data fetching.


* **20:01:43:** Minor UI updates and removal of a `hide` prop from the `DiscountMetricCard` component call.


* **20:03:01:** Further UI-related refinements to the `DiscountMetricCard` usage.  The `isSelected` prop was removed.


* **20:05:01:** Removal of `unit` property from `cardObject`'s `gross_sales` and `net_sales` objects.


* **20:08:31:**  Introduction of `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function from `commonFunctions.tsx` to handle data processing and updates the useEffect hook to use it.


* **20:09:34:** No notable changes observed.


* **20:20:20:** Removed `unit` property from `cardObject`'s `gross_sales` object.


The `commonFunctions.tsx` file, modified between 20:08:10 and 20:26:49, introduces several utility functions:

* `triggerDownload`: Handles the downloading of analytics data.
* `DownloadIcon`: A reusable component for download functionality.
* `checkKeys`:  A helper function for checking keys against configuration.
* `KwikCodLock`: A component displaying a lock icon and a message about KYC.
* `redirectToReport`: Function to redirect to a specific report.
* `fetchAllAnalyticsData`: Fetches all analytics data using Redux dispatch.
* `getDiscountAnalyticsData`: This function evolved through several commits.  It starts by simply logging the data, then filters the input data to include only specific keys (`discountStats`, `discountTrend`, etc.), and finally returns a processed array of data objects suitable for use in the component.  The final version extracts card-specific details.

In summary, the codebase is being developed to display discount analytics.  The changes show an iterative process of refining the UI, implementing data fetching and processing, and adding reusable components.  A pattern of using the `gokwik-ui-kit` is evident throughout. The most substantial changes happened around 20:08:10 with the introduction of the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function into `discountAnalytics.tsx` and its subsequent refinement in `commonFunctions.tsx`.


## 21:33:19
The log shows multiple updates to three files (`chartsData.tsx`, `commonFunctions.tsx`, and `discountAnalytics.tsx`) between 20:37 and 21:30 on March 6, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the analytics dashboard, specifically the discount analytics section.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`: This file contains data definitions for charts and summary blocks displayed on the analytics dashboard.  No significant changes were made to its content beyond minor formatting differences between timestamps.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx`: This file contains reusable functions for the analytics dashboard.  The most significant change is in the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function. Initially, this function returned an array, but it was modified several times to return an object with a `cardsSection` property containing `cardsData` and `lastUpdated`. The `last_updated` field was changed to `last_updated_at`.  Also, some commented-out code related to `cardsData` was removed and the `precentage` field was added to cardsData.  There's a recurring pattern of using `filter` and `map` operations to process data.  The `console.log` statements were also modified throughout the updates.  A `console.log` in the `fetchAllAnalyticsData` was added.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`: This component renders the discount analytics section.  The major change involves incorporating data from the `discountData` object returned by `getDiscountAnalyticsData`, specifically using  `discountData?.cardsSection?.cardsData` to populate the `DiscountMetricCard` components.  The initial versions of this component used hardcoded data for various tables; these were eventually removed and replaced with dynamic data from the `discountData` state.  The `useEffect` hook was initially missing a dependency array, causing potential issues, which were then corrected.


## 22:33:12
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` project, specifically focusing on the analytics section.  The most significant changes occur between 21:50:58 and 21:53:46 in  `src/pages/analytics/index.tsx`.  These changes primarily involve refining the logic for fetching and displaying analytics data.  The initial version (21:50:58) had a `console.log` statement that was removed in the subsequent commit at 21:52:58, suggesting debugging or cleanup. The final version (21:53:46) is functionally identical to the second version.


The `src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file was updated at 21:53:05. This commit added several utility functions: `triggerDownload` (for downloading analytics data), `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys` (for checking permission keys against config), `KwikCodLock` (UI component for locked content), `redirectToReport` (for navigation), and `fetchAllAnalyticsData` (to dispatch data fetching actions), and `getDiscountAnalyticsData` (processes discount analytics data).


Finally, `src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` underwent two revisions (21:56:15 and 21:58:39). These modifications focused on enhancing the display of discount analytics.  The changes involved structuring the data for presentation in tables and adding filtering capabilities using `Select` components to allow users to filter data by 'Offer Type' and 'Sub-Type'.  There's no functional difference between these two commits; the code is mostly the same except for some minor whitespace changes.  The component displays discount data using several tables and cards, offering download functionality through `DownloadOutlined` buttons.

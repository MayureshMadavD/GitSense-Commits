# Activity Summary for 09/06/2025

## 11:58:36
The commit on `09/06/2025, 11:00:30` modified `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`.  This file contains React components for displaying charts and metrics.  The major update involves the `Chart` component, which now handles multiple key-value pairs for data visualization, offering enhanced customization through props like `multiKeyValue`.  A custom tooltip function was added to handle displaying multiple data points in a clear manner.  The `MetricsGroup` and `KeyMetricCard` components were updated to include warning icons (`WarningFilled`) and tooltips (`Tooltip`) indicating the need for KwikPass integration for certain metrics.  The `DiscountMetricCard` component displays currency formatted numbers and percentage changes using visual cues (`ArrowUpOutlined`, `ArrowDownOutlined`).  Finally, `TrendDataBarChart` displays bar charts with customizable options for X and Y axes.  The overall changes focus on improving data presentation, error handling, and user experience by providing more informative visual cues and better handling of missing data or required integrations.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` on September 6th, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and likely do not represent significant functional changes to the code.  All revisions between 14:52:38 and 14:58:28 involve the same file and contain nearly identical code, suggesting iterative refinements rather than substantial restructuring. The file defines data structures for charts and tables displayed in an analytics dashboard, likely visualizing business and marketing metrics.  These metrics include total sales, total orders, average order value, checkout conversion, address prefill rates, and prepaid percentages. The code uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI components and custom helper functions for data formatting (`formatAmount`, `formatNumber`, `formatNumberInCurrency`).  There is consistent use of nested key structures (`nestedKey`) to access data from various sources (`realtimeStats`, `orderMetrics`, `marketingMetrics`).  No major structural changes or additions/deletions of significant code blocks are observed across the revisions.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` between 15:02:40 and 15:07:13 on September 6th, 2025.

The `commonFunctions.tsx` file underwent several updates focused primarily on the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function.  These changes involved modifications to the `createSuccessDiscountChartData` array, reducing its size across the different revisions. The initial version contained a large amount of data, which was progressively reduced in subsequent commits.  This suggests a debugging or data-refinement process.  The function processes discount analytics data, extracting information for various chart components like cards, overview, performance summary, and bifurcation.  It uses `useMemo` extensively for performance optimization.

The `chart.tsx` file shows a minor change in the `TrendDataBarChart` component, specifically the `plotOptions.bar.columnWidth` property which is adjusted from `'40px'` to `'42px'`. This is a small visual tweak to the bar chart's appearance.  The `Chart` component in this file utilizes data from `commonFunctions.tsx` to render different chart types. The `MetricsGroup` and supporting components (`KeyMetricCard`, `DiscountMetricCard`) handle the display of key metrics, including conditional rendering based on KwikPass integration status.  The use of `Tooltip` and `WarningFilled` components is consistent, indicating a consistent approach to providing informative warnings to the user.

The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` file and  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file.  The `chart.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 16:07:30 and 16:53:48 on September 6th, 2025. These revisions focused on refining the `TrendDataBarChart` component. Initially, it displayed up to 5 data points; this was later reduced to 2, then 3, 4 and finally, settled back to 5.  The `columnWidth`  parameter within the `plotOptions`  of the `ApexOptions` object for `TrendDataBarChart` was repeatedly adjusted, starting with a fixed width (`42px`, `60px`, `65px`, `80px`) then finally using `40%` or `60%` based on the data length.  There's also a consistent use of conditional rendering based on the `data`  prop, showing a "No Data exists for the requested range" message when applicable.   The `xaxis`  categories are dynamically generated from the data using `.map((item) => item.couponCode)`.  The `customTooltip` function for the chart was added and modified to display "Coupons Applied" and "Coupons Redeemed" values when  `multiKeyValue` length is greater than 1.

The `discountAnalytics.tsx` file was updated twice (at 16:55:10 and 16:55:59). The significant change was in the rendering logic for the `TrendDataBarChart` components. In the first version only 'Top Discount Used' was displayed, but the second revision included both 'Top Discount Used' and 'Top Discount Failed' bar charts.  Both versions used `useMemo` extensively for data manipulation and optimization.  The addition of the second chart in the second version implies an enhancement to display both successful and failed discount data.  The overall pattern in both files is using functional components with `useEffect` and `useMemo` hooks for better performance and data handling.  The styling consistently uses Tailwind CSS classes.

The commit on `09/06/2025, 11:00:30` modified `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`.  This file contains React components for displaying charts and metrics.  The major update involves the `Chart` component, which now handles multiple key-value pairs for data visualization, offering enhanced customization through props like `multiKeyValue`.  A custom tooltip function was added to handle displaying multiple data points in a clear manner.  The `MetricsGroup` and `KeyMetricCard` components were updated to include warning icons (`WarningFilled`) and tooltips (`Tooltip`) indicating the need for KwikPass integration for certain metrics.  The `DiscountMetricCard` component displays currency formatted numbers and percentage changes using visual cues (`ArrowUpOutlined`, `ArrowDownOutlined`).  Finally, `TrendDataBarChart` displays bar charts with customizable options for X and Y axes.  The overall changes focus on improving data presentation, error handling, and user experience by providing more informative visual cues and better handling of missing data or required integrations.

# Activity Summary for 09/06/2025

## 11:58:36
The commit on `09/06/2025, 11:00:30` modified `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx`.  This file contains React components for displaying charts and metrics.  The major update involves the `Chart` component, which now handles multiple key-value pairs for data visualization, offering enhanced customization through props like `multiKeyValue`.  A custom tooltip function was added to handle displaying multiple data points in a clear manner.  The `MetricsGroup` and `KeyMetricCard` components were updated to include warning icons (`WarningFilled`) and tooltips (`Tooltip`) indicating the need for KwikPass integration for certain metrics.  The `DiscountMetricCard` component displays currency formatted numbers and percentage changes using visual cues (`ArrowUpOutlined`, `ArrowDownOutlined`).  Finally, `TrendDataBarChart` displays bar charts with customizable options for X and Y axes.  The overall changes focus on improving data presentation, error handling, and user experience by providing more informative visual cues and better handling of missing data or required integrations.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` on September 6th, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and likely do not represent significant functional changes to the code.  All revisions between 14:52:38 and 14:58:28 involve the same file and contain nearly identical code, suggesting iterative refinements rather than substantial restructuring. The file defines data structures for charts and tables displayed in an analytics dashboard, likely visualizing business and marketing metrics.  These metrics include total sales, total orders, average order value, checkout conversion, address prefill rates, and prepaid percentages. The code uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI components and custom helper functions for data formatting (`formatAmount`, `formatNumber`, `formatNumberInCurrency`).  There is consistent use of nested key structures (`nestedKey`) to access data from various sources (`realtimeStats`, `orderMetrics`, `marketingMetrics`).  No major structural changes or additions/deletions of significant code blocks are observed across the revisions.

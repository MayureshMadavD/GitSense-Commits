# Activity Summary for 30/06/2025

## 13:05:16
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`, and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` between 12:30 PM and 1:04 PM on June 30, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent several revisions during this period.  The core change was consistently refining the `api_url` function, adding or adjusting URLs for various environments ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and several others). The `local` environment's `api_url` was changed multiple times, initially pointing to 'https://sandbox.gokwik.co', then to `https://api.gokwik.co`. The `setCart` function was also modified, receiving a different `cartjsObject` with varying total prices and items.  The timestamps suggest rapid iteration on API endpoint URLs.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 12:31 PM. This update involved modifications to the embedded Javascript code managing the Gokwik SDK initialization and interaction.  A commented-out section suggests a previous approach to loading the Gokwik checkout script.  The script also manages cookies (`gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`) which are set on page load.  The script includes several hardcoded merchant IDs (mids), app IDs, and app secrets, suggesting different merchant configurations were tested.  The `environment` variable within `window.merchantInfo` is set to 'local'.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` shows multiple revisions between 12:41 PM and 1:01 PM.  These edits focused on refining the calculation of `totalPrice`, incorporating various discounts, rewards, taxes, and COD charges. The logic handles different scenarios based on the current page (`store_page`), payment methods, and the presence of specific features (like partner acquisition offers or TwidPay).  The component also includes extensive subscription management for Svelte stores, handling updates to the cart, discounts, and other relevant data. A significant amount of code is dedicated to managing cart updates, including handling free items and adjusting subtotals accordingly.

The provided log shows modifications to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` directory.  Both modifications occurred on June 30th, 2025.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice within a minute (13:10:33 and 13:11:13).  These updates appear to be minor and do not change the core functionality of the code which is to define functions that return URLs based on the current environment (`env`).  The code includes a large number of conditional statements to handle various environment variables (e.g., 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', 'local', etc.).  There are functions for different API endpoints (health check, address suggestion, main API, analytics API v1 and v2, etc.), and for retrieving authentication tokens.  The changes likely involve minor corrections or additions to existing URL mappings for different environments.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` was updated at 13:15:28. This file is a Svelte component responsible for displaying the order summary in a checkout UI. The update significantly expands the component's logic, introducing extensive calculations for displaying the total price, handling discounts (coupon, prepaid, loyalty, MRP), shipping, taxes, and free gifts.  It heavily interacts with various Svelte stores (`store_...`) to manage and update the order summary data dynamically.  The component also incorporates event tracking (using `fireGtmEvent` and `fireAnalyticsGa4`) and manages cart updates, including handling free items and gift additions.  The update significantly enhances the order summary's functionality and integration with the application's state management system.

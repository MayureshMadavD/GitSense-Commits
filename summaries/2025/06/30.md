# Activity Summary for 30/06/2025

## 13:05:16
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`, and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` between 12:30 PM and 1:04 PM on June 30, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent several revisions during this period.  The core change was consistently refining the `api_url` function, adding or adjusting URLs for various environments ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and several others). The `local` environment's `api_url` was changed multiple times, initially pointing to 'https://sandbox.gokwik.co', then to `https://api.gokwik.co`. The `setCart` function was also modified, receiving a different `cartjsObject` with varying total prices and items.  The timestamps suggest rapid iteration on API endpoint URLs.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 12:31 PM. This update involved modifications to the embedded Javascript code managing the Gokwik SDK initialization and interaction.  A commented-out section suggests a previous approach to loading the Gokwik checkout script.  The script also manages cookies (`gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`) which are set on page load.  The script includes several hardcoded merchant IDs (mids), app IDs, and app secrets, suggesting different merchant configurations were tested.  The `environment` variable within `window.merchantInfo` is set to 'local'.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` shows multiple revisions between 12:41 PM and 1:01 PM.  These edits focused on refining the calculation of `totalPrice`, incorporating various discounts, rewards, taxes, and COD charges. The logic handles different scenarios based on the current page (`store_page`), payment methods, and the presence of specific features (like partner acquisition offers or TwidPay).  The component also includes extensive subscription management for Svelte stores, handling updates to the cart, discounts, and other relevant data. A significant amount of code is dedicated to managing cart updates, including handling free items and adjusting subtotals accordingly.

# Activity Summary for 30/06/2025

## 13:05:16
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`, and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` between 12:30 PM and 1:04 PM on June 30, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent several revisions during this period.  The core change was consistently refining the `api_url` function, adding or adjusting URLs for various environments ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and several others). The `local` environment's `api_url` was changed multiple times, initially pointing to 'https://sandbox.gokwik.co', then to `https://api.gokwik.co`. The `setCart` function was also modified, receiving a different `cartjsObject` with varying total prices and items.  The timestamps suggest rapid iteration on API endpoint URLs.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 12:31 PM. This update involved modifications to the embedded Javascript code managing the Gokwik SDK initialization and interaction.  A commented-out section suggests a previous approach to loading the Gokwik checkout script.  The script also manages cookies (`gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`) which are set on page load.  The script includes several hardcoded merchant IDs (mids), app IDs, and app secrets, suggesting different merchant configurations were tested.  The `environment` variable within `window.merchantInfo` is set to 'local'.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` shows multiple revisions between 12:41 PM and 1:01 PM.  These edits focused on refining the calculation of `totalPrice`, incorporating various discounts, rewards, taxes, and COD charges. The logic handles different scenarios based on the current page (`store_page`), payment methods, and the presence of specific features (like partner acquisition offers or TwidPay).  The component also includes extensive subscription management for Svelte stores, handling updates to the cart, discounts, and other relevant data. A significant amount of code is dedicated to managing cart updates, including handling free items and adjusting subtotals accordingly.


## 14:05:12
The provided log shows modifications to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` directory.  Both modifications occurred on June 30th, 2025.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice within a minute (13:10:33 and 13:11:13).  These updates appear to be minor and do not change the core functionality of the code which is to define functions that return URLs based on the current environment (`env`).  The code includes a large number of conditional statements to handle various environment variables (e.g., 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', 'local', etc.).  There are functions for different API endpoints (health check, address suggestion, main API, analytics API v1 and v2, etc.), and for retrieving authentication tokens.  The changes likely involve minor corrections or additions to existing URL mappings for different environments.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` was updated at 13:15:28. This file is a Svelte component responsible for displaying the order summary in a checkout UI. The update significantly expands the component's logic, introducing extensive calculations for displaying the total price, handling discounts (coupon, prepaid, loyalty, MRP), shipping, taxes, and free gifts.  It heavily interacts with various Svelte stores (`store_...`) to manage and update the order summary data dynamically.  The component also incorporates event tracking (using `fireGtmEvent` and `fireAnalyticsGa4`) and manages cart updates, including handling free items and gift additions.  The update significantly enhances the order summary's functionality and integration with the application's state management system.


## 14:05:18
The provided log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `customerEligibility.tsx` and `utmDiscount.tsx`.  The majority of changes are within `customerEligibility.tsx`, focusing on refining the handling of UTM parameters and customer segment selection.

**`customerEligibility.tsx` Updates:**

* **June 30, 2025, 13:33:07:** Initial commit of the component, which includes functionality for selecting customer eligibility criteria (all customers, new customers, existing customers, Shopify segments, or specific customers via CSV upload).  It handles CSV uploads, validation, and downloads a sample CSV.  The component also interacts with a Redux store (`fetchCustomerSegments`, `updateSummary`) to manage customer segments and discount summaries.

* **June 30, 2025, 13:52:05:**  A minor change in the `useEffect` hook that handles `utmParameters`.  The conditional assignment of `is_auto_apply` is improved to handle cases where `utmParameters` is null or undefined.

* **June 30, 2025, 13:57:29:**  Further refinement of the `useEffect` hook that handles `utmParameters`, enhancing the logic for setting `is_auto_apply`.  The check for the existence of 'is_auto_apply' within the utmParameters object is added.


* **June 30, 2025, 14:02:27 & 14:02:41:** These commits appear to be nearly identical and represent minor, likely unintentional, duplicate commits. They show no significant code changes from the previous version.


**`utmDiscount.tsx` Updates:**

* **June 30, 2025, 13:58:51 & 14:01:01:** This component manages UTM discount configurations.  It allows users to add, edit (implicitly through re-adding), and delete UTM parameters linked to discount codes. The changes between these two timestamps primarily involved correcting a potential error in setting the `is_auto_apply` field from the config data.  The original code incorrectly accessed the field, while the correction ensures that  `is_auto_apply` is handled correctly, even if it's not present in the `config.utm_discounts[0]` object. The component uses a custom hook (`useMerchantConfigApi`) for API interactions with discount configuration saving.  Data validation and error handling (for duplicate UTM entries and missing fields) are implemented.



**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* Both components heavily utilize the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements.
* Both components use `useEffect` hooks to handle asynchronous operations and data fetching.
* `titleCase` function from `@gokwik/utilities` is used consistently for formatting.
* Error handling using `message.error` is prevalent.
* The `Form` component from `gokwik-ui-kit` is used extensively for managing form state.

The changes primarily focus on improving error handling, data validation, and the robustness of the components' logic, particularly concerning the handling of optional fields and ensuring consistent behavior in various scenarios.


## 16:05:13
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` file was updated on June 30th, 2025 at 16:01:21.  This component, `DiscountVisibility`, is a React form for managing the visibility of discount codes at checkout.  It uses `react-redux` and `gokwik-ui-kit` components.

The form allows users to enable/disable discount code visibility, provide a description and details, and select visibility options ('ALWAYS' or 'ONLY_WHEN_ELIGIBLE').  Validation is implemented to ensure a description is provided when visibility is enabled and to prevent setting visibility to 'ALWAYS' for user-specific offers.

Conditional rendering displays additional fields for minimum and maximum price and quantity when 'Add More Conditions' is clicked.  Client-side validation ensures that min values are less than max values.

The component also shows a preview of how the discount code will appear to the customer, differentiating between scenarios where conditions are met and not met. Finally, informational alerts guide the user toward additional settings for customizing discount appearance and auto-application.  The code heavily uses React's functional components, hooks, and form handling features.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and one update to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated at 16:35:21 on 30/06/2025.  This update involves changes to the merchant page's HTML, including a button triggering a `goKwikCheckout` function that sends merchant information via `window.postMessage`. The code also includes logic for setting and retrieving cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), and a commented-out section that suggests previous implementations for loading the gokwik SDK and analytics.js.  The `merchantInfo` object contains details like merchant ID (`mid`), environment, store ID, and Facebook Pixel ID.  Various commented-out `mid` values suggest testing across different environments and stores.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file underwent three updates on 30/06/2025.  The most significant changes are within the `setCart()` function.  The initial version (16:33:55) contains a hardcoded cart object. The subsequent updates (16:43:13 and 16:46:03) modify the cart object's `token` and `attributes`, suggesting modifications to the cart data structure and potentially the integration with external services.  The updates also include minor differences in the cart object's attributes such as `LUID`, `SESSION_ID`, `WE_DATA`, and updated `token` and `key`.


The `EnvironmentService.ts` file consistently manages environment-specific URLs for various API endpoints (health, address suggestion, core API, Cred URL, experiment, twidpay, kp_api, CDN, and analytics APIs – versions 1 and 2). The code heavily relies on the `env` variable to determine the appropriate URL, using a large `if-else if` chain to handle different environments ('local', 'dev', 'qa', 'qa-rto', 'qaone', 'sandbox', 'production', 'hdev', 'ndev', 'qatwo', 'dev-core', 'qa-core', 'sandbox-core', 'pci-prod', 'idev'). There's also a pattern of using different base URLs for development and production environments. The `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` functions also return different tokens depending on the environment.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` files on June 30, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent several revisions throughout the afternoon and evening. The key change is the repeated modification of the `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` functions.  These functions return different tokens based on the environment ('dev', 'local', 'hdev', 'qatwo', 'ndev', 'idev', 'sandbox', 'production', 'pci-prod', 'qa', 'qaone'). Initially, these functions didn't handle the case where `env` might be undefined. A later update adds a check (`if (!env) env = window.merchantInfo?.environment;`) to handle this scenario.  The `setCart()` function is also repeatedly updated, with changes in the cart's `token`, `original_total_price`, `total_price`, `total_discount`, `item_count` and the contents of the `items` array, indicating different test scenarios or cart updates over time.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated once, at 17:12:57. This update maintains the core functionality of the merchant page, which includes a button triggering a `goKwikCheckout` function sending `window.merchantInfo` via `postMessage`.  The notable change is the continued use of `'local'` in `window.merchantInfo.environment`, consistently aligning with the 'local' environment updates in `EnvironmentService.ts`.  The commented-out sections suggest experimentation with various `mid` values and other parameters within `window.merchantInfo`.


The frequent changes in `EnvironmentService.ts` suggest ongoing development and testing across multiple environments.  The consistency in using the 'local' environment in both files points to a development workflow focused on local testing before deploying to different environments.  The evolution of the cart data in `EnvironmentService.ts`  indicates testing with varying cart compositions, possibly involving discounts and freebies.


## 19:05:12
The provided log shows updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` between 18:17:06 and 18:20:29 on June 30, 2025.  These updates primarily involve refinements to the `callShippingDiscountApi` and `processShippingDiscountResponse` functions.  Changes include:


* **Error Handling Improvements:** The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function's error handling was enhanced to include checking for `responseData?.discount?.errorMsg` in addition to `responseData.discount?.error` within the conditional statement controlling the call to `callPaymentMethods`. This suggests improved handling of various error scenarios.


* **Gift Card Handling:**  The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function was modified to improve gift card handling, particularly in scenarios where the cart is updated (`modified_cart` flag). The code now includes more robust handling of `giftCardData` to ensure that gift cards are reapplied correctly after a cart update.  Fixes for CHECKOUT-15842 and CHECKOUT-12982 are referenced, pointing to specific issue resolutions.


* **Confetti Enhancement (Minor):** The `callShippingDiscountApi` function's confetti trigger condition appears to have been slightly altered. The exact change is subtle and requires deeper analysis of the logical conditions for confetti display.


* **Logging Enhancement:** The `setShippingMethod` function now includes logging of a shipping method selection event, enhancing the tracking capabilities of the application.


The code consistently interacts with various store objects (e.g., `store_discountCallStatus`, `store_shippingOptionsResponse`, `store_selectedShippingMethod`) using RxJS's `subscribe` and update methods.  The code's overall structure remained consistent across the updates; the changes focused on improving the handling of API responses, error states, and gift card functionality.  The frequent commits suggest iterative development and debugging of the shipping discount service.

# Activity Summary for 05/06/2025

## 00:58:50
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` between 00:06:02 and 00:26:16 on May 6, 2025.  The `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` file primarily focuses on rendering charts using `ReactApexChart`, handling data processing, and displaying warning messages related to KwikPass integration.  The changes are incremental, mainly involving minor adjustments to styling and conditional rendering within the `DiscountMetricCard` component.  There's also a consistent use of `Tooltip` and `WarningFilled` components for displaying informative messages.


The `/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` file underwent several revisions, mostly focusing on the `formatNumberInCurrency` function.  Initial versions used simple rounding and concatenation for formatting numbers into K and L representations.  Later versions introduced a more robust `truncate` function for precise decimal handling and added the 'â‚¹' currency symbol. The changes between 00:19:20 and 00:33:29 specifically improve the handling of null, undefined, and NaN values in `formatNumberInCurrency`, ensuring a default '0' is returned in such cases.  The file also contains functions for date formatting, amount formatting, and other utility functions.


Between 00:34:43 and 00:50:17 on May 6, 2025, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` file was modified.  These changes involve defining filter options (`checkoutFunnelFilters`, `paymentMethodFilter`, `salesOrCountFilter`, `splitByFilter`), data structures for summary blocks (`SummaryBlocksData`, `SummaryBlocksDataSources`), table columns (`tableColumns`), and chart rows (`ChartRows`).  The data structures suggest the organization of data for displaying analytics related to business metrics (e.g., Total Orders, Average Order Value, Total Sales) and marketing metrics (e.g., Sales Attributed to Marketing, Sales by Marketing Parameters).  The components likely rely on the helper functions within `helper.ts` for data formatting.


Finally, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file was modified between 00:50:54 and 00:58:19 on May 6, 2025.  These changes involve building a React component responsible for presenting discount analytics data. It uses multiple tables and charts to display various metrics, including discount burn, average discount, gross and net sales, and conversion rates.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Table`, `Tag`, `Select`, and `Button`. A notable change is the introduction of `dummyTableData` which suggests a shift towards using mock data for certain sections of the analytics display. The pagination size in the `Table` component is also adjusted.


## 10:19:57
The log shows multiple revisions to two files between 01:00:43 and 01:18:37 on May 6, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file received two updates. The first update at 01:00:43 added several functions, including `triggerDownload` (for downloading analytics data), `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `getUniqueOptions`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, and `getDiscountAnalyticsData`.  The second update at 01:12:27 modified the `getUniqueOptions` function to uppercase the labels of the options returned. This change ensures consistency in label display.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file underwent several revisions.  The initial version at 01:00:56 displayed discount analytics data using several tables and charts. Subsequent updates focused primarily on improving the user interface of the Discount Type Overview section.  Specifically, the changes between 01:03:39 and 01:18:37 involved adding a `Select` component to filter data within the Discount Type Overview table by 'Offer Type' and 'Sub-Type'. The default value for Offer Type was changed to 'discount' at 01:14:30, and at 01:18:37, conditional rendering was added so the select components are only rendered when `discountData?.discountTypeOverview[0]?.length` is true.  The default values for the select components were also refined to handle cases where no data is present. A recurring element throughout the changes in this file is the use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.  The `DownloadOutlined` icon is consistently used across different sections to indicate download functionality.


## 12:19:53
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file.  All revisions made between 12:08:45 and 12:19:43 PM on May 6th, 2025, involve the same file and pertain to functions related to analytics data handling and display within a React application.

The primary changes are within the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function.  Initially (12:08:45), this function lacked a `?.` (optional chaining) operator in the `forEach` loop that populates `discountAnalyticsData`. This was added in subsequent commits (12:09:10 and 12:09:55).  A `console.log(discountAnalyticsData)` statement was added in the commit at 12:09:55, likely for debugging purposes.  No other functional changes seem to have occurred across the different commits.  The overall structure of the other functions (`triggerDownload`, `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `getUniqueOptions`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`) remained consistent throughout the revisions.  The code consistently uses React hooks (`useMemo`, `useState`), Redux (`AppDispatch`, `useSelector`), and various Gokwik-specific libraries for API calls, UI components, and single-spa routing.


## 13:19:52
The log shows code changes across two files on May 6th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` (12:23:20): This file contains various utility functions.  Updates include additions of functions for:

*   `getDynamicSearchFilters`: Filters search results based on `is_dynamic` property.
*   `formatDateString`: Formats dates according to 'en-GB' locale.
*   `formatAmount`: Formats numbers as Indian Rupees (INR) with customizable options.
*   `shopifyAppCheckoutEnabledStatus`: Checks if Shopify app checkout is enabled based on last login date.
*   `debounce`: Implements a debounce function.
*   `disabledBeforeDate` and `disabledBeforeTime`: Helper functions for date and time disabling.
*   `capitalizeFirstLetter`: Capitalizes the first letter of a string (optionally all words).
*   `uploadCohortCsv`: Uploads a CSV file, validating that it contains either all phone numbers or all emails.
*   `getFutureDateString`: Calculates and formats a future date.
*   `compareAndCaptureArrayFields`: Compares two arrays and identifies added and removed elements based on their IDs.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` (12:36:06): This component handles shipping method configuration. Key changes include:

*   Extensive use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components for creating a form-based UI for managing shipping configurations.
*   Implementation of functions for handling CSV uploads (`uploadCohortCsv` from `helper.ts` is used), including validation and error handling.  The CSV is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket via a pre-signed URL.
*   Use of `react-redux` for managing application state, accessing merchant details (`useSelector(getMerchantDetails)`).
*   Functions to fetch and display pincode lists, with error handling.
*   Form handling using `Form.useForm()` and `Form.useWatch()`.
*   State management using `useState` for various UI elements (modals, switches, edit status, etc.).
*   Custom rendering of form fields using `RenderField`.
*   Functions to handle saving and updating shipping configurations (`saveConfig`).


Both files extensively utilize functions from `@gokwik/utilities` for API calls and other utilities.  The `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file specifically uses pre-signed URLs for uploading CSV data to an AWS S3 bucket.  There's a consistent use of error handling and feedback messages using `message.error()` and `message.success()` throughout both files.  The overall pattern suggests a well-structured application with clear separation of concerns between utility functions and UI components.


## 14:19:59
The log shows multiple revisions to several files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory between 13:31 and 14:18 on May 6, 2025.  The primary focus appears to be on developing components related to analytics and discount dashboards.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` underwent several minor updates throughout the logged period.  These changes primarily involved refining the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function, ensuring data consistency and handling cases where data might be missing or null. A minor addition of `|| []` was made in `getDiscountAnalyticsData` to handle potential null values in `discountPerformanceSummary`.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` shows revisions focused on improving the UI of the discount analytics dashboard. Specifically, changes were made to the `discountData?.discountPerformanceSummary` usage in the Table component, adding a `|| []` to handle null or undefined values and ensuring the table renders correctly in those cases. There were no significant functional changes.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` shows a large code snippet representing a React component for configuring shipping methods.  This component includes features like form handling, CSV file upload for pincodes and cohorts, API calls for data fetching, and error handling. The component utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` library extensively and interacts with Redux for state management. Note that this file contains an incomplete code snippet.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`  was modified several times. These updates seem to be related to the configuration of charts and data displayed within the analytics dashboard. There are no major structural changes, just minor modifications to data handling.  The modifications suggest an iterative process of refining the data presentation and filtering options within the analytics section.

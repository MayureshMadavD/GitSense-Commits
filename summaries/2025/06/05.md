# Activity Summary for 05/06/2025

## 00:58:50
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` between 00:06:02 and 00:26:16 on May 6, 2025.  The `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` file primarily focuses on rendering charts using `ReactApexChart`, handling data processing, and displaying warning messages related to KwikPass integration.  The changes are incremental, mainly involving minor adjustments to styling and conditional rendering within the `DiscountMetricCard` component.  There's also a consistent use of `Tooltip` and `WarningFilled` components for displaying informative messages.


The `/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` file underwent several revisions, mostly focusing on the `formatNumberInCurrency` function.  Initial versions used simple rounding and concatenation for formatting numbers into K and L representations.  Later versions introduced a more robust `truncate` function for precise decimal handling and added the 'â‚¹' currency symbol. The changes between 00:19:20 and 00:33:29 specifically improve the handling of null, undefined, and NaN values in `formatNumberInCurrency`, ensuring a default '0' is returned in such cases.  The file also contains functions for date formatting, amount formatting, and other utility functions.


Between 00:34:43 and 00:50:17 on May 6, 2025, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` file was modified.  These changes involve defining filter options (`checkoutFunnelFilters`, `paymentMethodFilter`, `salesOrCountFilter`, `splitByFilter`), data structures for summary blocks (`SummaryBlocksData`, `SummaryBlocksDataSources`), table columns (`tableColumns`), and chart rows (`ChartRows`).  The data structures suggest the organization of data for displaying analytics related to business metrics (e.g., Total Orders, Average Order Value, Total Sales) and marketing metrics (e.g., Sales Attributed to Marketing, Sales by Marketing Parameters).  The components likely rely on the helper functions within `helper.ts` for data formatting.


Finally, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file was modified between 00:50:54 and 00:58:19 on May 6, 2025.  These changes involve building a React component responsible for presenting discount analytics data. It uses multiple tables and charts to display various metrics, including discount burn, average discount, gross and net sales, and conversion rates.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Table`, `Tag`, `Select`, and `Button`. A notable change is the introduction of `dummyTableData` which suggests a shift towards using mock data for certain sections of the analytics display. The pagination size in the `Table` component is also adjusted.

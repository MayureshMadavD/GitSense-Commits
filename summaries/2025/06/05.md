# Activity Summary for 05/06/2025

## 00:58:50
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` between 00:06:02 and 00:26:16 on May 6, 2025.  The `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` file primarily focuses on rendering charts using `ReactApexChart`, handling data processing, and displaying warning messages related to KwikPass integration.  The changes are incremental, mainly involving minor adjustments to styling and conditional rendering within the `DiscountMetricCard` component.  There's also a consistent use of `Tooltip` and `WarningFilled` components for displaying informative messages.


The `/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` file underwent several revisions, mostly focusing on the `formatNumberInCurrency` function.  Initial versions used simple rounding and concatenation for formatting numbers into K and L representations.  Later versions introduced a more robust `truncate` function for precise decimal handling and added the 'â‚¹' currency symbol. The changes between 00:19:20 and 00:33:29 specifically improve the handling of null, undefined, and NaN values in `formatNumberInCurrency`, ensuring a default '0' is returned in such cases.  The file also contains functions for date formatting, amount formatting, and other utility functions.


Between 00:34:43 and 00:50:17 on May 6, 2025, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` file was modified.  These changes involve defining filter options (`checkoutFunnelFilters`, `paymentMethodFilter`, `salesOrCountFilter`, `splitByFilter`), data structures for summary blocks (`SummaryBlocksData`, `SummaryBlocksDataSources`), table columns (`tableColumns`), and chart rows (`ChartRows`).  The data structures suggest the organization of data for displaying analytics related to business metrics (e.g., Total Orders, Average Order Value, Total Sales) and marketing metrics (e.g., Sales Attributed to Marketing, Sales by Marketing Parameters).  The components likely rely on the helper functions within `helper.ts` for data formatting.


Finally, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file was modified between 00:50:54 and 00:58:19 on May 6, 2025.  These changes involve building a React component responsible for presenting discount analytics data. It uses multiple tables and charts to display various metrics, including discount burn, average discount, gross and net sales, and conversion rates.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Table`, `Tag`, `Select`, and `Button`. A notable change is the introduction of `dummyTableData` which suggests a shift towards using mock data for certain sections of the analytics display. The pagination size in the `Table` component is also adjusted.


## 10:19:57
The log shows multiple revisions to two files between 01:00:43 and 01:18:37 on May 6, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file received two updates. The first update at 01:00:43 added several functions, including `triggerDownload` (for downloading analytics data), `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `getUniqueOptions`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, and `getDiscountAnalyticsData`.  The second update at 01:12:27 modified the `getUniqueOptions` function to uppercase the labels of the options returned. This change ensures consistency in label display.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file underwent several revisions.  The initial version at 01:00:56 displayed discount analytics data using several tables and charts. Subsequent updates focused primarily on improving the user interface of the Discount Type Overview section.  Specifically, the changes between 01:03:39 and 01:18:37 involved adding a `Select` component to filter data within the Discount Type Overview table by 'Offer Type' and 'Sub-Type'. The default value for Offer Type was changed to 'discount' at 01:14:30, and at 01:18:37, conditional rendering was added so the select components are only rendered when `discountData?.discountTypeOverview[0]?.length` is true.  The default values for the select components were also refined to handle cases where no data is present. A recurring element throughout the changes in this file is the use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.  The `DownloadOutlined` icon is consistently used across different sections to indicate download functionality.


## 12:19:53
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file.  All revisions made between 12:08:45 and 12:19:43 PM on May 6th, 2025, involve the same file and pertain to functions related to analytics data handling and display within a React application.

The primary changes are within the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function.  Initially (12:08:45), this function lacked a `?.` (optional chaining) operator in the `forEach` loop that populates `discountAnalyticsData`. This was added in subsequent commits (12:09:10 and 12:09:55).  A `console.log(discountAnalyticsData)` statement was added in the commit at 12:09:55, likely for debugging purposes.  No other functional changes seem to have occurred across the different commits.  The overall structure of the other functions (`triggerDownload`, `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `getUniqueOptions`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`) remained consistent throughout the revisions.  The code consistently uses React hooks (`useMemo`, `useState`), Redux (`AppDispatch`, `useSelector`), and various Gokwik-specific libraries for API calls, UI components, and single-spa routing.


## 13:19:52
The log shows code changes across two files on May 6th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` (12:23:20): This file contains various utility functions.  Updates include additions of functions for:

*   `getDynamicSearchFilters`: Filters search results based on `is_dynamic` property.
*   `formatDateString`: Formats dates according to 'en-GB' locale.
*   `formatAmount`: Formats numbers as Indian Rupees (INR) with customizable options.
*   `shopifyAppCheckoutEnabledStatus`: Checks if Shopify app checkout is enabled based on last login date.
*   `debounce`: Implements a debounce function.
*   `disabledBeforeDate` and `disabledBeforeTime`: Helper functions for date and time disabling.
*   `capitalizeFirstLetter`: Capitalizes the first letter of a string (optionally all words).
*   `uploadCohortCsv`: Uploads a CSV file, validating that it contains either all phone numbers or all emails.
*   `getFutureDateString`: Calculates and formats a future date.
*   `compareAndCaptureArrayFields`: Compares two arrays and identifies added and removed elements based on their IDs.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` (12:36:06): This component handles shipping method configuration. Key changes include:

*   Extensive use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components for creating a form-based UI for managing shipping configurations.
*   Implementation of functions for handling CSV uploads (`uploadCohortCsv` from `helper.ts` is used), including validation and error handling.  The CSV is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket via a pre-signed URL.
*   Use of `react-redux` for managing application state, accessing merchant details (`useSelector(getMerchantDetails)`).
*   Functions to fetch and display pincode lists, with error handling.
*   Form handling using `Form.useForm()` and `Form.useWatch()`.
*   State management using `useState` for various UI elements (modals, switches, edit status, etc.).
*   Custom rendering of form fields using `RenderField`.
*   Functions to handle saving and updating shipping configurations (`saveConfig`).


Both files extensively utilize functions from `@gokwik/utilities` for API calls and other utilities.  The `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file specifically uses pre-signed URLs for uploading CSV data to an AWS S3 bucket.  There's a consistent use of error handling and feedback messages using `message.error()` and `message.success()` throughout both files.  The overall pattern suggests a well-structured application with clear separation of concerns between utility functions and UI components.


## 14:19:59
The log shows multiple revisions to several files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory between 13:31 and 14:18 on May 6, 2025.  The primary focus appears to be on developing components related to analytics and discount dashboards.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` underwent several minor updates throughout the logged period.  These changes primarily involved refining the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function, ensuring data consistency and handling cases where data might be missing or null. A minor addition of `|| []` was made in `getDiscountAnalyticsData` to handle potential null values in `discountPerformanceSummary`.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` shows revisions focused on improving the UI of the discount analytics dashboard. Specifically, changes were made to the `discountData?.discountPerformanceSummary` usage in the Table component, adding a `|| []` to handle null or undefined values and ensuring the table renders correctly in those cases. There were no significant functional changes.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` shows a large code snippet representing a React component for configuring shipping methods.  This component includes features like form handling, CSV file upload for pincodes and cohorts, API calls for data fetching, and error handling. The component utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` library extensively and interacts with Redux for state management. Note that this file contains an incomplete code snippet.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx`  was modified several times. These updates seem to be related to the configuration of charts and data displayed within the analytics dashboard. There are no major structural changes, just minor modifications to data handling.  The modifications suggest an iterative process of refining the data presentation and filtering options within the analytics section.


## 15:20:00
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`.  The changes span from 14:23:14 to 15:18:26 on May 6th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` underwent several revisions, primarily focusing on refining data structures and potentially adding new features.  These changes were made in relatively short intervals, suggesting iterative development or bug fixing.  No significant structural changes are evident; rather, the modifications appear to be focused on adding new data points, adjusting existing data structures, and adding imports and minor modifications to existing variables.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` shows changes related to the UI and data presentation of discount analytics.  The most notable change between the initial and final versions is the removal of filter Selects within the `Discount Type-Wise Bifurcation` section and replacement of hardcoded table data with data from `discountData?.discountTypeBifurcation[0]`. This indicates a shift towards dynamically populating the table with data fetched from a data source, rather than hardcoding it.  Further changes show minor UI adjustments and formatting improvements, particularly the positioning of "Last updated on" timestamps.  A noteworthy update at 14:28:57 removed a large section of hardcoded sample data (`dataForTable2`), which reinforces the move towards dynamic data loading.  Later changes involve adjustments to the presentation of data from `discountData`, confirming a continuous effort to improve the display of discount information.


## 16:19:58
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx`.  The changes span from 15:32:24 to 16:19:36 on 05/06/2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` primarily involves updates to data structures (`SummaryBlocksData`, `SummaryBlocksDataSources`, `ChartRows`, `checkoutFunnelFilters`) related to displaying charts and tables in a dashboard.  These changes  appear to be focused on refining the data displayed, adding tooltips,  and managing data transformations for display as amounts, numbers, or percentages. The `InfoCircleOutlined` component from `gokwik-ui-kit` was added  at 15:59:10 suggesting an improvement in providing information to the user. There are no substantial structural changes,  only data adjustments and additions of helper functions and components.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` tracks modifications to a React component rendering discount analytics. The initial version at 15:43:35 presents a structured layout using `gokwik-ui-kit` components (Row, Col, Select, Table, Button) to display various discount metrics.  Subsequent changes (15:44:43, 15:45:06, 15:46:14) focus on enhancing the display of last updated timestamps and handling conditional rendering based on data availability. The most significant changes happened between 16:09:32 and 16:19:36,  primarily involving the addition of `className='w-48'` to the Select components within the Discount Type-Wise Bifurcation section at 16:11:13 for styling consistency, and small refinements to the `getUniqueOptions` function in `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` to improve data handling at 16:19:09.  The overall pattern in this file is iterative refinement of the UI and handling of edge cases (e.g., empty data).  The changes in this file heavily rely on data structures and functions defined in `chartsData.tsx`.


## 17:19:57
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` between 16:20:30 and 17:10:10 on May 6, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `getUniqueOptions` function and adding a new function, `setDiscountBifercationData`.

Initially, `getUniqueOptions` had inconsistencies in its logic for handling empty or undefined values.  Several iterations attempted to address this, with the final version (at 17:10:10) using `Array.from(new Set(...))` and `.filter((val) => val !== undefined && val !== null && val !== '')` for a more robust approach to filtering unique values, removing null, undefined and empty strings.

The `setDiscountBifercationData` function was introduced at 16:58:19. This function processes discount data, using `useMemo` to efficiently filter based on selected criteria (`type`, `category`, `status`).  Subsequent updates to this function (17:01:53 and 17:10:10) improved the filtering logic to correctly handle case-insensitive comparisons (using `.toLowerCase()`) and to ensure data is filtered only if a filter is actually applied (i.e., not "All").  The function also returns a state variable and a function to update the state variable.

The other functions in the file (`triggerDownload`, `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`, `getDiscountAnalyticsData`) remained largely unchanged throughout the revision process, indicating that the core functionality of these functions was not altered significantly. The `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function processes the analytics data into a format suitable for rendering in the user interface, using `useMemo` to optimize performance.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file was also updated at 16:58:01 and 17:06:13. These changes primarily involved integrating the new `setDiscountBifercationData` function and improving the filtering and display of the discount bifurcation data in the UI with added Select components to filter based on Type, Category and Status of discount codes.  The UI update at 17:06:13 incorporated the filtered data returned by `setDiscountBifercationData`.


## 18:20:01
The provided log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/` directory, focusing primarily on the `analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` and `analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` files.

The `commonFunctions.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 17:22:52 and 17:56:05.  These changes primarily involved refinements to data handling and filtering functions related to discount analytics. Specifically:

* **17:29:51:** The `setDiscountBifercationData` function was modified to improve its filtering logic, using a more concise and efficient approach for filtering data based on multiple criteria (`type`, `category`, and `status`). The data type was changed from `any` to `any[]`.
* **17:36:16:**  A `searchText` filter was added to the `setDiscountBifercationData` function, allowing filtering by a search text within the `title` field.
* **17:37:24 & 17:37:33:** Minor corrections were made to the `setDiscountBifercationData` function's search logic, specifically correcting how the searchText was accessed and ensuring proper comparison of lowercase values.
* **17:46:48:** The `setDiscountBifercationData` function was renamed to `useDiscountBifurcationData` and changed to a custom hook using `useMemo` and `useState`.  The search functionality was improved to use `includes` instead of strict equality for the `searchText` field making the search less strict, enabling partial matches.
* **17:55:19 & 17:56:05:** The `matchText` condition in `useDiscountBifurcationData` was changed to search within the `code` property instead of the `title` property. This was likely a correction to align the search with the intended data field.


The `discountAnalytics.tsx` file also saw modifications between 17:25:15 and 18:08:18, mostly related to UI improvements and incorporating the changes made to `commonFunctions.tsx`.  The key changes include:

* **17:40:00 & 17:40:19:** A search input (`Input` component) was added to the "Discount Type-Wise Bifurcation" section, allowing users to search by coupon code. Minor formatting adjustments were also made.
* **17:50:50:** The event handling for the search input was improved to correctly update the `dataFilters` state.
* **18:01:05:** The `rowKey` prop of the `Table` component in the "Discount Type-Wise Bifurcation" section was changed from using `item.code` to using the index, likely to handle potential duplicate `code` values.  The last updated timestamp display was moved to align better with the section header.
* **18:05:15:**  Code refactoring for improved readability and maintainability. A `SectionHeader` component was created to reduce repetition in the JSX. The Select components were simplified, removing redundant `defaultValue` and `value` props and using a more concise onChange handler. The mapping of the sections was streamlined using `map` for better code clarity.
* **18:08:18:** Placeholder content ('test' or 'chart') was added to sections to represent incomplete areas.


In summary, the code changes show a focused effort to improve the discount analytics dashboard's functionality and user interface.  The majority of changes center around enhancing data filtering and search capabilities within the discount data display, making the UI more user-friendly and efficient.


## 21:08:49
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file between 18:47 and 18:54 on May 6, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on improving the UI of the "Discount Type-Wise Bifurcation" section.

Initially, the code rendered the filter labels (`Type of Coupon Code`, `Category`, `Status`) within the same `div` as the Select components. Subsequent commits refactor this section:

* **18:47:33 - 18:49:07:** Minor formatting and code cleanup, specifically around spacing and unnecessary parenthesis.  No functional changes.
* **18:49:07 - 18:49:54:** Removal of unnecessary `<span>` elements which were used for labelling the filter Select components, this could be for better organization. 
* **18:49:54 - 18:51:53:** A `<span>` element was re-introduced, but this time used for better structure, placing label and `Select` inside the `<span>`.
* **18:51:53 - 18:53:23:** The `<span>` is now also styled with `flex flex-row items-center` to align the label and Select component horizontally in the center. 
* **18:53:23 - 18:54:12:** Finally, colons are added to the end of each filter label (`Type of Coupon Code:`, `Category:`, `Status:`),  and a `gap-2` class is added to the `<span>` to create spacing between the label and the Select component.


Throughout the revisions, the core functionality remains consistent:  the component displays discount analytics data using tables and charts from `gokwik-ui-kit` components.  The data is fetched and processed using functions like `getDiscountAnalyticsData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`, and `useDiscountBifurcationData`.  The last update timestamp for different data sections is consistently displayed.  The changes primarily reflect iterative UI refinement.

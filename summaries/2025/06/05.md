# Activity Summary for 05/06/2025

## 00:58:50
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` between 00:06:02 and 00:26:16 on May 6, 2025.  The `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chart.tsx` file primarily focuses on rendering charts using `ReactApexChart`, handling data processing, and displaying warning messages related to KwikPass integration.  The changes are incremental, mainly involving minor adjustments to styling and conditional rendering within the `DiscountMetricCard` component.  There's also a consistent use of `Tooltip` and `WarningFilled` components for displaying informative messages.


The `/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` file underwent several revisions, mostly focusing on the `formatNumberInCurrency` function.  Initial versions used simple rounding and concatenation for formatting numbers into K and L representations.  Later versions introduced a more robust `truncate` function for precise decimal handling and added the 'â‚¹' currency symbol. The changes between 00:19:20 and 00:33:29 specifically improve the handling of null, undefined, and NaN values in `formatNumberInCurrency`, ensuring a default '0' is returned in such cases.  The file also contains functions for date formatting, amount formatting, and other utility functions.


Between 00:34:43 and 00:50:17 on May 6, 2025, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-component/chartsData.tsx` file was modified.  These changes involve defining filter options (`checkoutFunnelFilters`, `paymentMethodFilter`, `salesOrCountFilter`, `splitByFilter`), data structures for summary blocks (`SummaryBlocksData`, `SummaryBlocksDataSources`), table columns (`tableColumns`), and chart rows (`ChartRows`).  The data structures suggest the organization of data for displaying analytics related to business metrics (e.g., Total Orders, Average Order Value, Total Sales) and marketing metrics (e.g., Sales Attributed to Marketing, Sales by Marketing Parameters).  The components likely rely on the helper functions within `helper.ts` for data formatting.


Finally, the `/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file was modified between 00:50:54 and 00:58:19 on May 6, 2025.  These changes involve building a React component responsible for presenting discount analytics data. It uses multiple tables and charts to display various metrics, including discount burn, average discount, gross and net sales, and conversion rates.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Table`, `Tag`, `Select`, and `Button`. A notable change is the introduction of `dummyTableData` which suggests a shift towards using mock data for certain sections of the analytics display. The pagination size in the `Table` component is also adjusted.

The log shows multiple revisions to two files between 01:00:43 and 01:18:37 on May 6, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file received two updates. The first update at 01:00:43 added several functions, including `triggerDownload` (for downloading analytics data), `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `getUniqueOptions`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, and `getDiscountAnalyticsData`.  The second update at 01:12:27 modified the `getUniqueOptions` function to uppercase the labels of the options returned. This change ensures consistency in label display.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` file underwent several revisions.  The initial version at 01:00:56 displayed discount analytics data using several tables and charts. Subsequent updates focused primarily on improving the user interface of the Discount Type Overview section.  Specifically, the changes between 01:03:39 and 01:18:37 involved adding a `Select` component to filter data within the Discount Type Overview table by 'Offer Type' and 'Sub-Type'. The default value for Offer Type was changed to 'discount' at 01:14:30, and at 01:18:37, conditional rendering was added so the select components are only rendered when `discountData?.discountTypeOverview[0]?.length` is true.  The default values for the select components were also refined to handle cases where no data is present. A recurring element throughout the changes in this file is the use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.  The `DownloadOutlined` icon is consistently used across different sections to indicate download functionality.


## 12:19:53
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-component/commonFunctions.tsx` file.  All revisions made between 12:08:45 and 12:19:43 PM on May 6th, 2025, involve the same file and pertain to functions related to analytics data handling and display within a React application.

The primary changes are within the `getDiscountAnalyticsData` function.  Initially (12:08:45), this function lacked a `?.` (optional chaining) operator in the `forEach` loop that populates `discountAnalyticsData`. This was added in subsequent commits (12:09:10 and 12:09:55).  A `console.log(discountAnalyticsData)` statement was added in the commit at 12:09:55, likely for debugging purposes.  No other functional changes seem to have occurred across the different commits.  The overall structure of the other functions (`triggerDownload`, `DownloadIcon`, `checkKeys`, `KwikCodLock`, `redirectToReport`, `getUniqueOptions`, `fetchAllAnalyticsData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`) remained consistent throughout the revisions.  The code consistently uses React hooks (`useMemo`, `useState`), Redux (`AppDispatch`, `useSelector`), and various Gokwik-specific libraries for API calls, UI components, and single-spa routing.

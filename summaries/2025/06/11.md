# Activity Summary for 11/06/2025

## 13:17:39
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project between 12:19 PM and 12:58 PM on November 6th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the handling of environment variables, discount application logic, and merchant information within the application.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice (12:19:34 and 12:54:22).  The key change was in the `api_url()` function which maps different environment variables ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.) to their corresponding API base URLs.  The  `local` environment's API URL was changed from `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` to `https://api.gokwik.co` in the second update.  This file also defines functions to generate base URLs for various services based on the environment.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated twice (12:19:46 and 12:56:53). These updates involved minor adjustments to the merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`) object, particularly the `mid` (merchant ID) property, which was changed to different values across several updates, seemingly reflecting various testing or staging environments.  The core functionality of this file, which initializes the Gokwik SDK and handles merchant information, remains consistent.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts` was updated twice (12:20:59 and 12:21:06).  These updates appear to be minor formatting changes or possibly a very small addition (the last line). The file manages many Svelte stores holding application state, including cart information, user data, and various flags for UI control.  The number of stores and their complexity suggests a rich application state management system.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` (12:22:22): This file contains functions for interacting with the merchant's API.  It uses several stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage the API requests and responses, indicating close coupling between the API interaction and application state.  The code suggests a system designed to handle various API calls related to cart, login, address management, and order processing.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` was updated multiple times (12:23:39, 12:23:44, 12:23:58, 12:27:23). This file manages the application of shipping and discounts.  Several updates focused on refining error handling and logic around discount application, particularly regarding retry mechanisms (`discount_shipping_retry`) and the handling of gift cards within the discount calculation. The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function shows significant effort in handling various response scenarios and updating the application state based on them.  The repeated updates suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the discount logic.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` was updated twice (12:44:34 and 12:58:35).  These updates relate to the discounts section of the UI.  The most substantial change in the later update was within the `store_offers.subscribe` block. It modifies how the application handles one-click coupons ("min_discount" and "max_discount" types), removing a condition that may have been causing errors. This demonstrates ongoing work to improve the discount selection and application, particularly concerning one-click coupons.  The large number of imports and variables suggest a complex system for managing discounts and related UI elements.


In summary, the codebase is undergoing active development, with a focus on improving the robustness of the discount and shipping calculation logic, handling of various API responses, and UI responsiveness.  The frequent updates to `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` highlight the iterative nature of the development process, and the changes in the `merchant.html` file suggest testing across various environments. The use of Svelte stores reveals a sophisticated state management strategy within the application.


## 14:17:28
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file between 13:24:23 and 13:45:03 on November 6th, 2025.  All revisions involve updates to the same Svelte component handling discounts in a checkout process.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on managing various types of discounts (coupons, store credit, partner offers, one-click coupons), handling discount stacking, and updating the UI accordingly.

The changes primarily involve refinements within the `onMount` function's subscriptions to various stores (`store_requestIdObject`, `store_reapplyEr`, `store_discountBasedRewards`, `store_partnerAcquisitionOffer`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, and `store_offers`). These refinements primarily involve minor adjustments to the logic controlling discount application, especially concerning one-click coupon handling and discount stacking. For example,  a condition `!curr.freeProductCount` was removed in multiple places within the `store_offers` subscription  (`min_discount` and `max_discount` conditions), likely a bug fix related to CHECKOUT-15805.  There's also some minor cleanup of logic around applying multiple one-click coupons.  The overall structure and variables remain largely unchanged throughout the revisions, suggesting iterative debugging and improvement rather than a major restructuring of the component.


## 15:17:29
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file, updated at 15:15:57 on 11/06/2025, is a crucial service handling environment-specific configurations.  It defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestions, main API, Cred, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, analytics) and CDN paths based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The code extensively uses conditional logic to determine the appropriate URL for each API based on the `env` variable, which is obtained from a store.  A significant portion of the code manages different API endpoints for various environments.  A `local` environment setting is also included, pointing to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` by default.  Additionally, it includes functions to set and retrieve cookies related to landing pages and referrer information.  The file also manages tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that vary depending on the environment.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file, updated at 15:16:15 on 11/06/2025, is a merchant landing page. It includes a button triggering a `goKwikCheckout` function that sends merchant information via a `postMessage` to a parent window.  The merchant information includes a `mid` (merchant ID), environment details (`local` in this instance), and other identifiers.  The page dynamically loads a `gokwik.js` script from `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js`  or other URLs depending on the environment based on the `gokwikSdk.init()` call.  A commented-out section suggests the possibility of alternative loading methods for the GOKwik script.  The file also initializes a basic GoKwik SDK. The script sets and retrieves cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to track user sessions.  The presence of many commented-out `mid` values suggests that the page has been used for testing with various merchant IDs.


## 16:17:34
The provided log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`.  The file is a TypeScript service handling shipping discounts and related actions within a checkout process.  Key changes revolve around gift card handling and code cleanup/refactoring.

Between 15:20:22 and 15:59:34, several commits focused on improving the handling of gift cards (`giftCardData`) within the `processShippingDiscountResponse` function.  Initially, there was a section seemingly addressing issue CHECKOUT-14308,  iterating over gift card data.  Subsequent commits refine this section significantly. In one commit at 15:36:04, the `giftCardData` array is simply cleared if `modified_cart` is true, reflecting a simplification in gift card management. Later commits at 15:47:21 and 15:48:49  introduce  a more robust approach, storing the previous `giftCardData` before clearing it and then re-fetching gift cards individually using `getGiftCard`.  This change aims at correctly handling gift cards when the cart is updated.  The final revision at 15:59:34 adds a comment "Handling GiftCard on Cart Update" to clarify this improved logic.

Another notable change, around 16:01:23, involves refactoring the `processShippingDiscountResponse` function by extracting a reusable `updateTwidCall` function to reduce redundancy in gift card handling logic.  This enhances the maintainability of the code.


The consistent theme across all revisions is the management of asynchronous operations (`async/await`), particularly in handling API calls for discounts and cart updates.  The code extensively utilizes observable stores (e.g., `store_giftCard`, `store_discountCallStatus`) for state management, which is a common pattern in reactive programming.  Error handling (using `try...catch`) and logging (using `logEvent`) are consistently present.  Finally, there's evidence of addressing specific checkout issues (CHECKOUT-14308, CHECKOUT-12982, CHECKOUT-15842) throughout the development process.


## 17:17:28
The provided log shows three revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`.  All three revisions are almost identical; the only difference lies within the `processShippingDiscountResponse` function, specifically in how it handles the `getGiftCard` function.

* **Revision 1 (11/06/2025, 16:36:41):** The `getGiftCard` function is called with `i?.code`  to access the gift card code.


* **Revision 2 (11/06/2025, 16:39:53):**  The `getGiftCard` function is called using bracket notation `i['code']` to access the gift card code. This is a minor change in syntax, likely a stylistic adjustment or a fix to potential issues with optional chaining (`?.`).

* **Revision 3 (11/06/2025, 17:17:11):** Identical to Revision 2.

The file itself is a TypeScript service handling shipping discounts. It heavily uses observable stores (using `subscribe` methods) from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage application state.  The `callShippingDiscountApi` and `processShippingDiscountResponse` functions are central to the logic, interacting with a `discountShippingCall` API to fetch and process discount and shipping information.  Error handling, gift card management, and UI updates (using snackbar and loader states) are also prominent features.  The code includes logging using `logEvent` and integrates with services like Shopify and potentially loyalty programs.  There is a use of confetti effects for successful coupon application. The `currentPage` variable suggests a multi-step checkout process.  The changes between revisions are very minor and focused on the handling of gift card data, suggesting debugging or code cleanup rather than a significant functional change.


## 18:17:28
The provided code represents a TypeScript service (`ShippingDiscount.service.ts`) handling shipping discounts and related logic.  Two versions are shown, with a minor change between them. Both versions heavily utilize observable stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage application state.

The core functionality involves the `callShippingDiscountApi` function, which makes an API call to fetch shipping discounts.  This function handles various scenarios, including successful discount application (with confetti effects for certain user cohorts), loyalty point application logging, error handling, and updates to the UI state based on API responses.  The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function processes the API response and updates relevant stores, handling cases like setting shipping methods, options, and discounts. It also includes logic for handling gift cards, particularly during cart updates (a fix for CHECKOUT-15842).  Another notable section addresses a retry mechanism for discount and shipping calculations (possibly related to CHECKOUT-12982).

The difference between the two code versions is subtle: In the second version, within the `processShippingDiscountResponse` function and the gift card handling section,  `i['provider']` is changed to `i['']`  in the for loop of the first if condition.  Also, `modified_cart` is set to false after the loop in the second version.  This suggests a potential bug fix related to gift card handling and cart updates.

The timestamps (11/06/2025, 17:21:36 and 11/06/2025, 17:22:24) indicate that these changes were made within a minute of each other, likely reflecting a quick iterative development cycle.


## 21:17:30
The log shows updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`.

The `merchant.html` file was modified twice, at 20:28:23 and 20:30:03 on November 6th, 2025.  These changes appear minor and involve no structural alterations to the HTML. The changes seem to primarily focus on the Javascript code within the file.  The Javascript code manages a `gokwikSdk` object responsible for payment processing and communication with a backend service via `postMessage`.  It also includes cookie management for tracking landing pages and referrers and contains commented-out code related to loading external scripts and a commented-out section related to  `merchantInfo` object that includes various merchant IDs for different environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  The `merchantInfo` object consistently includes `environment`, `type`, `storeId`, and `fbpixel` fields.

The `EnvironmentService.ts` file was modified once at 20:28:36 on November 6th, 2025. This TypeScript file defines functions that return different API base URLs based on the current environment ('local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and others).  The environment is retrieved from a store. The file also contains functions to manage cart and request IDs, specifically setting them when the environment is 'local'.  There are multiple API endpoints defined for different services (health check, address suggestions, core API, cred URL, experiment URL, Twidpay API, KP API, CDN path, analytics API (v1 and v2), and merchant URLs).  Each function selects an appropriate URL based on the environment variable.  The file also includes functions to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) depending on the environment.  A function `setCart` initializes a cart object with sample data.  The extensive branching within the functions indicates a complex system with many different environments and API endpoints.

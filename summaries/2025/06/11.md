# Activity Summary for 11/06/2025

## 13:17:39
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project between 12:19 PM and 12:58 PM on November 6th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the handling of environment variables, discount application logic, and merchant information within the application.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice (12:19:34 and 12:54:22).  The key change was in the `api_url()` function which maps different environment variables ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.) to their corresponding API base URLs.  The  `local` environment's API URL was changed from `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` to `https://api.gokwik.co` in the second update.  This file also defines functions to generate base URLs for various services based on the environment.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated twice (12:19:46 and 12:56:53). These updates involved minor adjustments to the merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`) object, particularly the `mid` (merchant ID) property, which was changed to different values across several updates, seemingly reflecting various testing or staging environments.  The core functionality of this file, which initializes the Gokwik SDK and handles merchant information, remains consistent.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts` was updated twice (12:20:59 and 12:21:06).  These updates appear to be minor formatting changes or possibly a very small addition (the last line). The file manages many Svelte stores holding application state, including cart information, user data, and various flags for UI control.  The number of stores and their complexity suggests a rich application state management system.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` (12:22:22): This file contains functions for interacting with the merchant's API.  It uses several stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage the API requests and responses, indicating close coupling between the API interaction and application state.  The code suggests a system designed to handle various API calls related to cart, login, address management, and order processing.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` was updated multiple times (12:23:39, 12:23:44, 12:23:58, 12:27:23). This file manages the application of shipping and discounts.  Several updates focused on refining error handling and logic around discount application, particularly regarding retry mechanisms (`discount_shipping_retry`) and the handling of gift cards within the discount calculation. The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function shows significant effort in handling various response scenarios and updating the application state based on them.  The repeated updates suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the discount logic.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` was updated twice (12:44:34 and 12:58:35).  These updates relate to the discounts section of the UI.  The most substantial change in the later update was within the `store_offers.subscribe` block. It modifies how the application handles one-click coupons ("min_discount" and "max_discount" types), removing a condition that may have been causing errors. This demonstrates ongoing work to improve the discount selection and application, particularly concerning one-click coupons.  The large number of imports and variables suggest a complex system for managing discounts and related UI elements.


In summary, the codebase is undergoing active development, with a focus on improving the robustness of the discount and shipping calculation logic, handling of various API responses, and UI responsiveness.  The frequent updates to `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` highlight the iterative nature of the development process, and the changes in the `merchant.html` file suggest testing across various environments. The use of Svelte stores reveals a sophisticated state management strategy within the application.


## 14:17:28
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file between 13:24:23 and 13:45:03 on November 6th, 2025.  All revisions involve updates to the same Svelte component handling discounts in a checkout process.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on managing various types of discounts (coupons, store credit, partner offers, one-click coupons), handling discount stacking, and updating the UI accordingly.

The changes primarily involve refinements within the `onMount` function's subscriptions to various stores (`store_requestIdObject`, `store_reapplyEr`, `store_discountBasedRewards`, `store_partnerAcquisitionOffer`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, and `store_offers`). These refinements primarily involve minor adjustments to the logic controlling discount application, especially concerning one-click coupon handling and discount stacking. For example,  a condition `!curr.freeProductCount` was removed in multiple places within the `store_offers` subscription  (`min_discount` and `max_discount` conditions), likely a bug fix related to CHECKOUT-15805.  There's also some minor cleanup of logic around applying multiple one-click coupons.  The overall structure and variables remain largely unchanged throughout the revisions, suggesting iterative debugging and improvement rather than a major restructuring of the component.

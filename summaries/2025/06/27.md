# Activity Summary for 27/06/2025

## 11:32:57
The log shows several code changes on June 27, 2025, related to a checkout dashboard UI, specifically focusing on analytics features.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` (10:57:57): This file was updated to modify the analytics header component.  Key changes include adding a select component for choosing a checkout platform ('kwik_checkout' triggers navigation to `/shopify-app/analytics`), another select for sales channels, and an `AnalyticsDateRangePicker` with a `disabledDate` function to restrict date selection based on the chosen screen ('checkout', 'website', or 'discount') and a minimum selectable date (April 1, 2025).  The component also logs events using `logEvent` based on user interactions and the selected screen.  The `screenOptions` array dynamically adjusts based on URL parameters, reflecting a modular design accommodating different analytics views.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/chartsData.tsx` (10:59:16 & 11:00:34): This file, modified twice in quick succession, defines data structures for various analytics charts and summary blocks.  It contains filter options for payment methods, sales or count, and split-by criteria for the charts, and multiple arrays (`SummaryBlocksData`, `SummaryBlocksDataSources`, `ChartRows`) defining the data to be displayed for summary blocks and charts, including  metrics like total sales, total orders, average order value, and checkout conversion. The second update to this file appears to be minor and doesn't introduce any significant changes in functionality.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/discountAnalytics.tsx` (11:22:36 & 11:22:42): This file, updated twice within a short timeframe, implements the discount analytics page. It renders several `AnalyticsCard` components, each displaying different aspects of discount data.  These include metric cards, tables showing discount type overviews and performance summaries, charts displaying discount usage trends and bar charts for top discounts used and failed.  Download functionality (`DownloadIcon`) is integrated for each section. The second update made a minor change to the width of a Select component for better UI.  The code utilizes custom hooks (`useDiscountBifurcationData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`) to manage data filtering and selection, indicating a well-structured approach to data handling.  The overall structure suggests a focus on providing a comprehensive and interactive view of discount analytics.

The changes across these files demonstrate a consistent pattern of building a robust analytics dashboard with reusable components and clear data organization. The use of custom hooks promotes code reusability and maintainability.  The frequent updates within short time intervals suggest an iterative development process with bug fixing or minor UI/UX improvements.


## 13:33:01
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx`  between 12:34 PM and 12:59 PM on June 27, 2025, and to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` between 13:05 PM and 13:16 PM on June 27, 2025, and finally to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/utmDiscount.tsx` between 13:17 PM and 13:18 PM on June 27, 2025.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` file underwent numerous minor revisions focusing primarily on the `onValuesChange` function within the `Form` component.  Initial versions logged `allValues` to the console. Later versions attempted to modify the `utmParameters` within `allValues` to include `is_auto_apply` from `utmParamInputs`, and then ultimately to remove `is_auto_apply` from `allValues` entirely.  The final change in this file involved switching the `onChange` handler for the auto-apply switch to directly update the `utmParameters` array in the form state instead of updating the `utmParamInputs` state.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` file saw changes related to an alert message. The initial version displayed an alert about controlling UTM discount visibility. This was later replaced with a more precise alert indicating that disabling discount code visibility would prevent its display on checkout.  No functional changes were made besides the update in the alert message.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/utmDiscount.tsx` file had a single, minor revision. An alert message explaining UTM discount visibility control was conditionally rendered based on the `is_auto_apply` value in `utmValues`.  If `is_auto_apply` is false, the alert is displayed; otherwise, it's not.  This improves UI clarity by only showing the information when relevant.


## 16:32:51
The log shows three updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` on June 27, 2025.  The key change across all updates is a modification to the `screenOptions` variable within the `AnalyticsHeader` component.

The first update (16:11:05) conditionally renders 'Discount Analytics' and 'Website Analytics' in `screenOptions` based on the presence of 'discount' and 'website' in the URL's search parameters.

The second update (16:13:33) modifies the `screenOptions` logic.  If `merchantDetails?.m_id` equals '4bzi40ahksbqurl7', it always includes 'Checkout Analytics', 'Discount Analytics', and 'Website Analytics'. Otherwise, it falls back to the conditional logic from the previous version.  This suggests a specific merchant ID has a different analytics configuration.

The third update (16:15:02) further refines this conditional logic.  The merchant ID triggering the static screen option set is changed from '4bzi40ahksbqurl7' to '12wyqc2guqmkrw6406j'.  This indicates a different merchant now has a customized analytics view.  The rest of the component remains consistent across all three updates, focused on date selection, filtering, and event logging via `logEvent` function calls.  The changes are localized to the way the available analytics screens are determined, suggesting different configurations for different clients.

The log shows modifications to components related to a checkout dashboard UI and its configuration.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` file, updated at 16:44:44 on 27/06/2025, is a React component responsible for handling customer eligibility for discounts.  It uses various UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` to create a form for selecting customer eligibility criteria (all customers, new customers, existing customers, Shopify segments, or specific customers via CSV upload). The component fetches customer segments from a Shopify store and allows for CSV upload and validation of phone numbers. It also includes functionality for downloading sample CSV files and handling UTM parameters.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file, updated at 16:45:08 on 27/06/2025, appears to be an EJS template for setting up the dashboard UI, configuring various import maps for different environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production), and including scripts for runtime and analytics. This file dynamically loads different versions of the application based on the deployment environment.

Multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/utmDiscount.tsx` occurred between 16:57:21 and 17:31:22 on 27/06/2025. This React component manages UTM-based discount configuration.  The changes primarily focus on refining the handling of the `is_auto_apply` flag for UTM discounts. Initially, the default value and handling were inconsistent; subsequent commits adjusted the default to `true` and ensured that changes to `is_auto_apply` are reflected in both `utmValues` and the `dataSource`. The component allows users to add, edit, and delete UTM parameter sets linked to discount codes, showing error messages for missing fields and duplicate entries.  The `saveConfig` function handles persistence of configurations.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` file, updated at 17:18:41 on 27/06/2025, is the main settings page component. It uses React Router to render different settings sub-pages based on the route.  It handles pincode settings, shipping settings, discount configurations, bulk discounts, integrations, customization, tax settings, payment settings, merchant agreements, and free gift configurations.  A significant part of this commit involves handling the display and interaction with a merchant agreement, including polling for agreement status and using a modal to display the agreement.

Finally, the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/index.tsx` file, updated at 17:18:54 on 27/06/2025, is a component that renders a series of collapsible sections each representing different aspects of checkout configurations, including COD limits, discount code blocking, various types of discounts (GWP, tiered, sales channel specific, dynamic, buy X at Y), discount applicability, capping, and UTM-based discounting.  The file heavily uses Tooltips to explain each configuration.  The key takeaway is that this is a central component to manage various discount and checkout settings.

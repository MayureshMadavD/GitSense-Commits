The log shows several code changes on June 27, 2025, related to a checkout dashboard UI, specifically focusing on analytics features.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` (10:57:57): This file was updated to modify the analytics header component.  Key changes include adding a select component for choosing a checkout platform ('kwik_checkout' triggers navigation to `/shopify-app/analytics`), another select for sales channels, and an `AnalyticsDateRangePicker` with a `disabledDate` function to restrict date selection based on the chosen screen ('checkout', 'website', or 'discount') and a minimum selectable date (April 1, 2025).  The component also logs events using `logEvent` based on user interactions and the selected screen.  The `screenOptions` array dynamically adjusts based on URL parameters, reflecting a modular design accommodating different analytics views.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/chartsData.tsx` (10:59:16 & 11:00:34): This file, modified twice in quick succession, defines data structures for various analytics charts and summary blocks.  It contains filter options for payment methods, sales or count, and split-by criteria for the charts, and multiple arrays (`SummaryBlocksData`, `SummaryBlocksDataSources`, `ChartRows`) defining the data to be displayed for summary blocks and charts, including  metrics like total sales, total orders, average order value, and checkout conversion. The second update to this file appears to be minor and doesn't introduce any significant changes in functionality.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/discountAnalytics.tsx` (11:22:36 & 11:22:42): This file, updated twice within a short timeframe, implements the discount analytics page. It renders several `AnalyticsCard` components, each displaying different aspects of discount data.  These include metric cards, tables showing discount type overviews and performance summaries, charts displaying discount usage trends and bar charts for top discounts used and failed.  Download functionality (`DownloadIcon`) is integrated for each section. The second update made a minor change to the width of a Select component for better UI.  The code utilizes custom hooks (`useDiscountBifurcationData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`) to manage data filtering and selection, indicating a well-structured approach to data handling.  The overall structure suggests a focus on providing a comprehensive and interactive view of discount analytics.

The changes across these files demonstrate a consistent pattern of building a robust analytics dashboard with reusable components and clear data organization. The use of custom hooks promotes code reusability and maintainability.  The frequent updates within short time intervals suggest an iterative development process with bug fixing or minor UI/UX improvements.

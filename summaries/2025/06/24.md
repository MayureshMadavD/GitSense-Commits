# Activity Summary for 24/06/2025

## 13:24:19
The log shows code changes on June 24, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated at 12:40:45. This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-spa application.  The changes involve modifying the import map to load different versions of the application's modules based on the `deployedEnv` variable (dev, qa, sandbox, production).  Different URLs are used for each environment, pointing to various instances of the  `@gokwik` modules (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, kwikpass, rto, kwikship, ellora, checkout-platform, shopify-app, and kwikcomm).  Local development uses `localhost` URLs for some of these modules.  The production environment includes Clarity and New Relic scripts, indicating performance monitoring and analytics are integrated.  The New Relic configuration includes settings for error tracking, distributed tracing, and session replay. The code also includes several polyfills for older browsers.  There's a conditional inclusion of a Clarity script based on the availability of a `clarityKey`.


## 13:24:21
The log shows two updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts`, at 13:19:49 and 13:21:19 on 24/06/2025.  Both updates contain identical code, suggesting a possible redundant commit or a very minor, undetectable change between versions.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` file was updated at 13:11:07 on 24/06/2025. This update is substantial, involving a Svelte component managing various aspects of merchant checkout. Key features include:

* **Extensive analytics integration:**  The code includes calls to numerous analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA Analytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, and Shopify Analytics), indicating a focus on comprehensive tracking and data collection.
* **Multiple payment method handling:**  The component seems to handle various payment methods and integrates with UPI (Unified Payments Interface) checking.
* **Shopify integration:**  Specific handling for Shopify sessions and cookies suggests integration with the Shopify e-commerce platform.
* **Extensive state management:** The component uses many variables to track various states, such as loading state, cart information, user information, and various flags for different features.
* **Conditional rendering:** The code includes conditional logic based on environment (dev, production, etc.), device type (Android, iOS), and query parameters.
* **Cookie and local storage management:** The component actively uses cookies and local storage for storing and retrieving data.
* **Truecaller integration:** The inclusion of `truecallerConfig` with various API keys suggests integration with the Truecaller identity verification service.  Note that these keys should be kept secure and not committed to a public repository.
* **Error handling and logging:** The code includes `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors and `console.log` statements for debugging.

In summary, the `Merchant.svelte` component is a complex piece of code responsible for managing the merchant-specific checkout experience, incorporating a wide range of functionalities, and integrating multiple third-party services. The `CommonStore.ts` file defines a comprehensive set of Svelte stores managing the application state.


## 14:24:30
The log shows multiple updates to Svelte components and associated service files between 13:29 and 14:04 on June 24, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts` underwent three revisions.  The primary change across these revisions is the addition of  `kpFbPixelInterface` to the import statement from `./../services/Interfaces.ts`. No other significant code changes are observable in the diff.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Interfaces.ts` was updated once, with no immediately obvious pattern in the changes other than general maintenance or type definition updates.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` was updated twice.  The most significant change is the addition of  `getKpFromUrl()` function to extract `kp_mclid` from the URL parameters and its use to populate the `kp_fb_id` variable. This suggests an enhancement related to retrieving a Kwikpass Marketing Cloud ID (kpmclid) from the URL.  Minor changes also appear in error handling and logging.  The second revision further refines this by adding a check in `setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad` to prioritize `getKpFromUrl()` over the cookie value for `kp_fb_id`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts` was updated once. This update modified how  `fbExternalId` is subscribed to and populated from the store.  The key change is replacing the previous method of assigning the `external_id` with assigning `kp_fb_external_id`, which suggests a change in the naming or structure of data related to Facebook external IDs.  The file also shows extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state.  Many different analytics platforms are integrated (Facebook, Google Analytics, Snapchat, etc.).

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` was updated once.  This update focuses primarily on handling of the message event (`window.addEventListener('message', ...)`), enhancing error handling for empty carts, and improving the management of the `localStorageObject` and related tokens.  The code showcases a complex checkout flow with numerous components and states. The integration with multiple analytics services is also apparent, alongside Shopify-specific functionalities.


The overall pattern across these changes suggests ongoing development and refinement of a checkout UI, with a focus on improved analytics tracking, error handling, and integration with various third-party services (Shopify, various analytics platforms, payment providers).  The frequent updates to `CommonStore.ts` indicate that it plays a central role in managing the application's state.  The `Merchant.svelte` updates focus on improving data handling and parameter acquisition, specifically around tracking data.


## 16:24:28
The provided log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`.  The changes span a period of roughly 20 minutes on June 24th, 2025.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**: This file tracks changes related to analytics tracking.  Several updates were made between 16:04:07 and 16:16:00. The primary focus is on integrating various analytics platforms (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Wigzo, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, and Shopify Analytics).  The code heavily utilizes subscriptions to stores (LoginStore, OrderStore, CommonStore) to collect data points like discount amounts, order details, user information, and source URLs.  This data is then used to construct and send events to the respective analytics platforms.  A notable change involved adding `kpmclid` variable to store `kp_fb_id`  from `store_fbExternalId` subscription. The `adSourceMapping` function also underwent revisions, likely to improve the handling and parsing of UTM parameters.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**: This file manages the merchant's checkout UI. The modifications between 16:04:37 and 16:20:50 primarily center around enhancing cookie handling and URL parameter processing.  The code retrieves various parameters from cookies and URL search parameters, including `shopifySessionId`, UTM parameters, Facebook and Snapchat IDs, and discount codes. These values are then used to populate variables within the component and to initialize the checkout process.  The `getKpmclidParam` function evolved from obtaining this parameter directly from the URL to also checking for it within cookies.  The list `sessionIDFixMerchants` was also modified by adding more merchant IDs to it.  The code also includes extensive logic for handling different environments (local, dev, production, sandbox, qa, qatwo), suggesting a robust deployment strategy across various stages.  The component uses numerous functions to interact with multiple analytics services, reflecting a comprehensive approach to tracking user actions.

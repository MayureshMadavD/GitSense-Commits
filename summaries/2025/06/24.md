## 14:24:30
The log shows multiple updates to Svelte components and associated service files between 13:29 and 14:04 on June 24, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts` underwent three revisions.  The primary change across these revisions is the addition of  `kpFbPixelInterface` to the import statement from `./../services/Interfaces.ts`. No other significant code changes are observable in the diff.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Interfaces.ts` was updated once, with no immediately obvious pattern in the changes other than general maintenance or type definition updates.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` was updated twice.  The most significant change is the addition of  `getKpFromUrl()` function to extract `kp_mclid` from the URL parameters and its use to populate the `kp_fb_id` variable. This suggests an enhancement related to retrieving a Kwikpass Marketing Cloud ID (kpmclid) from the URL.  Minor changes also appear in error handling and logging.  The second revision further refines this by adding a check in `setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad` to prioritize `getKpFromUrl()` over the cookie value for `kp_fb_id`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts` was updated once. This update modified how  `fbExternalId` is subscribed to and populated from the store.  The key change is replacing the previous method of assigning the `external_id` with assigning `kp_fb_external_id`, which suggests a change in the naming or structure of data related to Facebook external IDs.  The file also shows extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state.  Many different analytics platforms are integrated (Facebook, Google Analytics, Snapchat, etc.).

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` was updated once.  This update focuses primarily on handling of the message event (`window.addEventListener('message', ...)`), enhancing error handling for empty carts, and improving the management of the `localStorageObject` and related tokens.  The code showcases a complex checkout flow with numerous components and states. The integration with multiple analytics services is also apparent, alongside Shopify-specific functionalities.


The overall pattern across these changes suggests ongoing development and refinement of a checkout UI, with a focus on improved analytics tracking, error handling, and integration with various third-party services (Shopify, various analytics platforms, payment providers).  The frequent updates to `CommonStore.ts` indicate that it plays a central role in managing the application's state.  The `Merchant.svelte` updates focus on improving data handling and parameter acquisition, specifically around tracking data.


## 16:24:28
The provided log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`.  The changes span a period of roughly 20 minutes on June 24th, 2025.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**: This file tracks changes related to analytics tracking.  Several updates were made between 16:04:07 and 16:16:00. The primary focus is on integrating various analytics platforms (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Wigzo, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, and Shopify Analytics).  The code heavily utilizes subscriptions to stores (LoginStore, OrderStore, CommonStore) to collect data points like discount amounts, order details, user information, and source URLs.  This data is then used to construct and send events to the respective analytics platforms.  A notable change involved adding `kpmclid` variable to store `kp_fb_id`  from `store_fbExternalId` subscription. The `adSourceMapping` function also underwent revisions, likely to improve the handling and parsing of UTM parameters.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**: This file manages the merchant's checkout UI. The modifications between 16:04:37 and 16:20:50 primarily center around enhancing cookie handling and URL parameter processing.  The code retrieves various parameters from cookies and URL search parameters, including `shopifySessionId`, UTM parameters, Facebook and Snapchat IDs, and discount codes. These values are then used to populate variables within the component and to initialize the checkout process.  The `getKpmclidParam` function evolved from obtaining this parameter directly from the URL to also checking for it within cookies.  The list `sessionIDFixMerchants` was also modified by adding more merchant IDs to it.  The code also includes extensive logic for handling different environments (local, dev, production, sandbox, qa, qatwo), suggesting a robust deployment strategy across various stages.  The component uses numerous functions to interact with multiple analytics services, reflecting a comprehensive approach to tracking user actions.


## 17:24:38
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts` file and the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` file between 16:24 and 17:23 on June 24, 2025.  The changes primarily involve enhancements to the tracking and analytics functionality within the GoKwik checkout process.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`:**

This file underwent several minor edits within a short time frame.  The core functionality remained consistent, focusing on collecting various data points related to the checkout flow (discount amounts, COD charges, user addresses, shipping methods, etc.) and forwarding this information to different analytics platforms (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Wigzo, Facebook, Google Analytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, and Shopify Analytics).  The primary change across revisions was the renaming of the `kpmclid` variable to `kp_facebook_cli_id` and then finally to `kpFbCliId`. This suggests a refactoring effort to improve naming conventions for better code readability. There are also several commented-out lines of code within `store_foreignAnalytics.subscribe` which may indicate experimentation or features under development.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`:**

This file also experienced multiple revisions during the same period.  It's a Svelte component responsible for the merchant-specific logic and integrations within the GoKwik checkout flow. The major changes were related to how cookies are handled and used to populate data such as `shopifySessionId`, `snapchatAttributes.uuid_c1`, `sourceValue`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, `discountCode`, `shopify_landing_page`, `sp_duid`, `shopify_orig_referrer`, `sa_shopify_y`, `sa_shopify_t`, `sa_shopify_p`, `sa_localization`, `fbExternalId`, and `kpFbCliId`.  The updates include improvements in fetching these values from both cookies and URL parameters and logging the  `kpFbCliId` and `fbExternalId` values.  This suggests a focus on enhancing the data collection and initialization process for a more robust and accurate analytics reporting.  The `getKpParamForFb` function was also modified to accept a URL argument improving its reusability. A console log statement was added to debug the `kpFbCliId` and `fbExternalId`.  The `setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad` function now includes a `console.log("cookies called")` which could be for debugging purposes.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Interfaces.ts`:**

This file saw a single revision adding `kpFbCliId` to the `LaunchData` interface. This change reflects the addition of the Facebook click ID to the data passed to the application.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`:**

This file includes several revisions during this period.  The primary focus of the edits appears to be handling different scenarios during the checkout process, especially those concerning abandoned carts and the loading state of the application.  There's a lot of error handling and state management happening, with subscriptions to numerous stores and event listeners to handle various messages and events.  No significant structural changes are visible, but numerous small modifications were made to refine the application's behavior.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`:**

This file shows a single revision, focusing on setting cookies (`gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`) on page load.  This aligns with the changes in the `Merchant.svelte` component to enhance the management of cookies and data retrieval across various sources.

In summary, the code changes reflect a concerted effort to improve the data collection and analytics capabilities of the GoKwik checkout system, mainly focusing on Facebook pixel integration and robust cookie management.  The frequent minor revisions suggest an iterative development process with a focus on refining details and handling edge cases in the checkout flow.


## 18:35:44
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` file, updated on 24/06/2025 at 17:27:20, is a Svelte component handling merchant checkout integration.  The code extensively uses various analytics services (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA Analytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, Customer Labs, Shopify Analytics), indicating a focus on tracking and reporting.  It manages various parameters related to the checkout process, including cart information, tokens, user identification (e.g., phone number, email), and environment (dev, production, etc.).  The component interacts with an iframe, likely displaying the actual checkout UI, and handles events related to the iframe's state.  Significant logic is devoted to handling cookies and local storage, extracting information from URLs and cookies (e.g., `_shopify_s`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, UTM parameters).  A key function `launchApp` initializes the checkout based on received `MerchantInfoInterface` data. The code includes conditional logic based on the merchant ID, environment, and device type (Android, iOS, Safari).  The `truecallerConfig` object shows API keys for different environments, highlighting a concern for secure key management.  A notable function `insertKeyframes` dynamically injects CSS styles, suggesting animation handling. The component also appears to implement custom event handling (`gokwikLoaded`, `close_modal`, etc.) and utilizes a custom `Event.service`.  Finally, there's a significant section focused on handling different sources of session IDs, potentially dealing with variations across different platforms or integrations.


## 22:37:00
The log shows modifications to two React components: `productSearch.tsx` and `editAbcCart.tsx`.  `productSearch.tsx` underwent two nearly identical updates within a short timeframe (22:30:43 and 22:30:57), suggesting a minor, likely inconsequential, code adjustment. The changes in `productSearch.tsx` are extensive and involve a search component for products and collections, featuring functionalities like pagination, debouncing, and handling of collated products.  It uses a custom UI kit (`gokwik-ui-kit`) and interacts with a Shopify API (`fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`).

`editAbcCart.tsx` shows a single update at 22:35:18 and then another at 22:35:41. These updates, again very similar,  relate to a component for editing abandoned carts. This component interacts with various APIs (using `makeAPICall`) for customer and address management, order creation (`createOrder`), and discount/shipping calculations (`discountShipping`).  It leverages several libraries, including `react-redux`, `react-router-dom`, and `single-spa`.  The component's state management is complex, handling various aspects of customer details, shipping addresses, payment methods (including COD and payment links), discounts, and OTP verification.  The function `createOrder` handles order creation with different payment methods, and various helper functions manage API calls and UI updates.  There is heavy use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library.  The code also indicates the use of environment variables (`process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and `APIEndPoints`) for API endpoints.

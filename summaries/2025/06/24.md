# Activity Summary for 24/06/2025

## 13:24:19
The log shows code changes on June 24, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated at 12:40:45. This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-spa application.  The changes involve modifying the import map to load different versions of the application's modules based on the `deployedEnv` variable (dev, qa, sandbox, production).  Different URLs are used for each environment, pointing to various instances of the  `@gokwik` modules (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, kwikpass, rto, kwikship, ellora, checkout-platform, shopify-app, and kwikcomm).  Local development uses `localhost` URLs for some of these modules.  The production environment includes Clarity and New Relic scripts, indicating performance monitoring and analytics are integrated.  The New Relic configuration includes settings for error tracking, distributed tracing, and session replay. The code also includes several polyfills for older browsers.  There's a conditional inclusion of a Clarity script based on the availability of a `clarityKey`.

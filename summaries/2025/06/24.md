# Activity Summary for 24/06/2025

## 13:24:19
The log shows code changes on June 24, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was updated at 12:40:45. This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-spa application.  The changes involve modifying the import map to load different versions of the application's modules based on the `deployedEnv` variable (dev, qa, sandbox, production).  Different URLs are used for each environment, pointing to various instances of the  `@gokwik` modules (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, kwikpass, rto, kwikship, ellora, checkout-platform, shopify-app, and kwikcomm).  Local development uses `localhost` URLs for some of these modules.  The production environment includes Clarity and New Relic scripts, indicating performance monitoring and analytics are integrated.  The New Relic configuration includes settings for error tracking, distributed tracing, and session replay. The code also includes several polyfills for older browsers.  There's a conditional inclusion of a Clarity script based on the availability of a `clarityKey`.

The log shows two updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts`, at 13:19:49 and 13:21:19 on 24/06/2025.  Both updates contain identical code, suggesting a possible redundant commit or a very minor, undetectable change between versions.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` file was updated at 13:11:07 on 24/06/2025. This update is substantial, involving a Svelte component managing various aspects of merchant checkout. Key features include:

* **Extensive analytics integration:**  The code includes calls to numerous analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA Analytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, and Shopify Analytics), indicating a focus on comprehensive tracking and data collection.
* **Multiple payment method handling:**  The component seems to handle various payment methods and integrates with UPI (Unified Payments Interface) checking.
* **Shopify integration:**  Specific handling for Shopify sessions and cookies suggests integration with the Shopify e-commerce platform.
* **Extensive state management:** The component uses many variables to track various states, such as loading state, cart information, user information, and various flags for different features.
* **Conditional rendering:** The code includes conditional logic based on environment (dev, production, etc.), device type (Android, iOS), and query parameters.
* **Cookie and local storage management:** The component actively uses cookies and local storage for storing and retrieving data.
* **Truecaller integration:** The inclusion of `truecallerConfig` with various API keys suggests integration with the Truecaller identity verification service.  Note that these keys should be kept secure and not committed to a public repository.
* **Error handling and logging:** The code includes `try...catch` blocks to handle potential errors and `console.log` statements for debugging.

In summary, the `Merchant.svelte` component is a complex piece of code responsible for managing the merchant-specific checkout experience, incorporating a wide range of functionalities, and integrating multiple third-party services. The `CommonStore.ts` file defines a comprehensive set of Svelte stores managing the application state.

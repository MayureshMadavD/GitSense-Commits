# Activity Summary for 26/06/2025

## 12:01:23
The log shows code changes on June 26, 2025, primarily focusing on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-page application (SPA) dashboard.

The significant changes involve altering the import map within the `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` tags. These import maps define where different JavaScript modules are loaded from, depending on the `deployedEnv` variable (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The different environments point to different URLs for modules like `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, and others, suggesting a system designed for different deployment stages.  In the production environment, additional scripts for Clarity (tracking/analytics) and New Relic (monitoring) are included.  The local environment uses `localhost` URLs for several modules.

The timestamp for the major changes to `src/index.ejs` is 11:35:48 on June 26, 2025. The file contains a Content Security Policy (CSP) meta tag, which restricts the resources the browser can load to enhance security.  The use of SystemJS import maps and CDN-hosted React and React-DOM libraries indicates a modern JavaScript framework architecture.  The inclusion of `regenerator-runtime` suggests the use of async/await features that may require polyfills for older browsers.

Notably, the file structure implies a modular architecture where different components of the dashboard (configuration, utilities, checkout, payment, etc.) are loaded as separate modules from various URLs.  The consistent pattern of using `@gokwik` as a prefix for module names suggests a consistent internal naming convention.


## 13:01:28
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx`**: This file, updated at 12:26:58 on 26/06/2025, primarily concerns the main analytics dashboard.  The update appears to be a minor refactoring, removing unnecessary code and potentially improving performance or readability.  No significant functional changes are apparent in the comparison of the initial and final versions.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 12:12:27 and 12:21:01 on 26/06/2025.  The changes focus on the  `AnalyticsHeader` component, responsible for date selection, sales channel filtering, and screen switching within the analytics dashboard.

* **12:12:27:** Initial commit.  The component included date range pickers with a 90-day limit, sales channel selection (if not a Shopify app), and a segmented control for switching between "Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," and "Website Analytics" views.  The "Discount Analytics" option was disabled if no discount information was present in the URL search parameters.

* **12:13:05:** A minor bug fix in the segmented control, correcting a condition that incorrectly disabled the 'Discount Analytics' option. The condition `disabled: location.search.includes('discount')` changed to `disabled: !location.search.includes('discount')`.

* **12:15:12:** The logic for enabling/disabling "Discount Analytics" was improved. Instead of relying on the presence of "discount" in the URL search parameters, the component now checks for a "coupon" parameter.  This change suggests a shift towards using a more explicit indicator for discount data availability.

* **12:15:41:** The `Segmented` component's options were simplified, removing the conditional disabling of "Discount Analytics". All three options ("Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," and "Website Analytics") are always available.

* **12:15:53:**  "Discount Analytics" was removed from the options array, simplifying the UI.

* **12:16:00:** "Discount Analytics" was reintroduced into the options array.

* **12:18:06:** The `screeOptions` array was introduced to manage the segmented control options dynamically,  making the code more readable.

* **12:20:15:** The logic for conditionally including "Discount Analytics" in the `screeOptions` array was refined, using  `location?.search?.includes('discount')` which accounts for the possibility of `location.search` being null.

* **12:20:26:**  Minor refinement in the conditional inclusion of 'Discount Analytics' in `screeOptions`. The change is primarily stylistic, using `location?.search?.includes('discount')` instead of `location.search.includes('discount')`.

* **12:21:01:** The conditional inclusion of "Discount Analytics" in `screeOptions` was further refined to handle potential null values in `location.search` and ensures that "Discount Analytics" is included as an array element even if the condition is met.


The overall pattern in `/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` shows iterative refinement of the UI logic for showing or hiding the "Discount Analytics" option.  The final version uses a more robust and readable approach to dynamically manage the available analytics screens based on the URL parameters.  The changes to `index.tsx` seem unrelated to these UI refinements and suggest a separate, less impactful code cleanup effort.


## 14:01:32
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` and one revision to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/renderFormItem.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/renderFormItem.tsx` file was updated twice, with minor changes between 13:35:55 and 13:36:23.  The primary change involved correcting the type of the `label` property in the `CustomField` interface from `any` to `string`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 13:26:46 and 13:58:57.  These changes primarily focused on enhancing the UI component for customer discount eligibility. Key updates include:

* **13:37:14:** Added `Tooltip` component from `gokwik-ui-kit` to provide more information on certain form items.  This suggests an improvement in user experience.

* **13:39:55 - 13:58:57:**  The most significant changes occurred in this period, revolving around the addition of a new `Switch` component for controlling  `utm_discount_visiblity`. The initial implementation included a default `checked` property (13:44:44), which was later modified to reflect the state of the `utmParamInputs` object (13:51:39 and 13:52:15). This `utm_discount_visiblity` is also added as a column to the existing table.  The `onChange` handler for the switch is implemented to update the `utmParamInputs` state accordingly, facilitating two-way data binding. The Tooltip associated with the switch was also updated to better reflect functionality.

* **Throughout the revisions:**  There is consistent use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components (`Alert`, `Button`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Row`, `Col`, `Select`, `Upload`, `Tooltip`, etc.) and functions for API calls and CSV handling.  This indicates a reliance on a specific UI framework and consistent coding practices.

* **CSV Handling:** The component includes robust handling for CSV uploads, including validation checks for empty files, correct formatting, and 10-digit phone number validation.  Error messages are provided through `message.error()` to inform the user of issues.


In summary, the majority of changes focused on improving the user interface of the customer eligibility form within the discount management section, specifically adding a toggle for UTM parameter based discount visibility, and improving the user experience with better tooltips and error messaging. The `renderFormItem` component received only minor, mostly type-related updates.


## 15:01:23
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx`.  The file is a React component responsible for handling customer eligibility for discounts.

The main changes revolve around the UI and logic for handling customer segment selection and CSV uploads for specific customer discounts.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

* **14:01:41:** Initial version of the component.  It includes functionality for selecting customer eligibility (all customers, new customers, existing customers, Shopify segments, specific customers), uploading CSV files for specific customers, selecting Shopify customer segments, and displaying UTM parameters.  Error handling is in place for invalid CSV formats and phone numbers. A sample CSV download is also implemented.

* **14:02:59:** A minor change was made to the column header in the UTM parameters table.  "UTM Discount Visibility" was changed to "Discount Visibility."

* **14:14:11:** A `console.log` statement was added to log the `utmParameters` variable.  This suggests debugging or logging of the UTM parameter data.

* **14:18:13:** No discernible changes in code from the previous revision.  The commit likely only involved a change outside of the code itself, such as a commit message.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

* The component heavily uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.
* There's consistent use of `Form.useWatch` to access form values.
* Error handling is implemented throughout the CSV upload process to check for empty files, invalid formats, and invalid phone numbers.
* The component interacts with a backend API (`makeAPICall`) for fetching customer segments and downloading CSV files.
* The code uses functional components and hooks like `useEffect` and `useState`.


The overall pattern suggests iterative development, with minor UI tweaks and likely bug fixes or additions to logging between revisions.  The primary functionality of the component remains consistent throughout all revisions.


## 15:01:25
The log shows multiple code changes across three files on June 26, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`  (14:23:35): This file, a Svelte component, underwent a substantial update.  The changes primarily involve enhancements to analytics integrations (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA Analytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics),  handling of various query parameters (`mrid`, `src`, `ch`, `kwik`, `so_token`, `gk_token`), cookie management, and environment-specific configurations.  The addition of `checkIosChrome` function suggests improved cross-platform compatibility.  The inclusion of  `sessionIDFixMerchants` array indicates special handling for specific merchant IDs, likely related to Shopify session ID management.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to managing the display and communication with an iFrame, including error handling and event listeners.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Facebook.ts` (14:24:01): This file contains functions related to Facebook Pixel integration.  The code tracks events, and includes  functions `initPageViewEvt` and `facebookAnalyticsEvent` which manage page views and custom/standard event tracking, respectively. It uses different pixel IDs based on the environment and includes logic to handle custom events via `fbq`.  Hardcoded pixel IDs are present for different environments, suggesting a need for a more dynamic approach.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (14:54:36, 14:55:35, 14:55:42): This file was modified three times in quick succession.  The changes focus on defining functions that dynamically return base URLs for various services based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.). The `api_url`, `getCredUrl`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, and `analytics_api_v2` functions all provide environment-specific URLs.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object; the cart data changes between the second and third modifications (14:55:35 and 14:55:42) suggesting a cart update was deployed during this time.  The use of Svelte stores (`store_environment`, `store_cartjsObject`, etc.) indicates a reactive approach to managing application state.  There's a high degree of repetition in how the environment is handled across all these functions indicating a potential opportunity for refactoring.


## 16:01:24
The code changes log shows updates to the checkout dashboard UI, specifically focusing on settings pages.  Significant changes occurred on June 26th, 2025, between 15:50:19 and 15:54:58.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` (15:50:19): This file was extensively modified.  The update primarily involves restructuring the settings menu and adding components for various settings like Pincode, Shipping, Discounts (manual, bulk, automatic), Payment, Integrations, and more.  The code uses React Router for navigation and React Redux for state management.  A significant portion deals with rendering a user agreement page and managing its display based on API calls and user data. The `settingsList` array defines the structure of the settings menu, dynamically adjusting based on user roles and configurations. Event tracking using `logEvent` is implemented for certain menu selections.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/index.tsx` (15:51:47): This file received an update focusing on the "Checkout Configs" section. It introduces a collapsible menu (`Collapse` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`) containing various discount configuration options (COD limits, discount codes, tiered discounts, sales channel discounts, dynamic discounts, Buy X at Y, discount applicability, discount capping, GWP with any discount, and UTM-based discounting). Each option is displayed with a tooltip for detailed explanation. The component leverages `useSelector` from `react-redux` to access user configuration data.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` (15:54:58): This file was updated to manage customer eligibility for discounts. It uses a form (`Form` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`) to allow selection of eligibility criteria (all customers, new customers, existing customers, Shopify customer segments, or specific customers via CSV upload).  The component includes features for uploading and downloading CSV files, validating phone numbers, and interacting with APIs (`makeAPICall`) to fetch Shopify customer segments and download cohort CSVs.  The code handles both bulk and non-bulk discounts and incorporates UTM parameters for targeted discounts.


Recurring elements across the files include the use of:

*   `gokwik-ui-kit` components for UI rendering.
*   `react-redux` for state management.
*   `@gokwik/utilities` for various utility functions (API calls, date formatting, etc.).
*   Extensive use of tooltips to provide detailed information to the user.


The overall changes suggest a significant enhancement to the checkout dashboard UI's settings management, providing a more comprehensive and user-friendly interface for configuring various aspects of the checkout process.  The updates heavily emphasize discount configuration options, with detailed explanations and robust data handling capabilities.


## 17:01:22
The log shows three revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`, a Svelte component written in TypeScript.  All three revisions are nearly identical, suggesting minor, inconsequential changes between commits.  The timestamps indicate the modifications occurred within a short period: 16:18:14, 16:33:29, and 16:39:31 on June 26th, 2025.

The component heavily utilizes various analytics libraries (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA Analytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, Customer Labs, Shopify Analytics), indicating a focus on tracking and event handling.  It also interacts with cookies and local storage extensively, managing data such as `shopifySessionId`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, and various UTM parameters.  The code includes functions for handling UPI app availability checks (`checkAvailableApp`), setting and retrieving cookies, and managing a modal (`showModal`).  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to parsing URL parameters and cookies to extract crucial information for the checkout process.  The `truecallerConfig` object reveals different API keys for various environments (local, dev, production, sandbox, QA).  The code also demonstrates handling of different checkout flows (potentially related to different payment methods or platforms).  The lack of substantive changes between the three revisions suggests that these commits may be related to debugging or minor adjustments rather than major feature implementations.


## 18:01:22
The log shows two updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/OfferBanner.svelte`, a Svelte component rendering an offer banner.  Both updates occurred on June 26th, 2025. The first update was at 17:16:17, and the second at 17:35:41.

The core functionality remains unchanged: the component dynamically renders an offer banner based on data from `store_requestIdObject` in `CommonStore`.  The banner's appearance (background color, text color, and content) is determined by the `custom_config` property within the `reqIdObject`. The banner's visibility is conditional on the current page (`store_page` from `LoginStore`), showing different banners for login, address, and payment pages.

The only substantive difference between the two versions lies within the styling (`<style>` tag). The padding in the `.offer-strip` class was changed from `5px` to `4px` in the second update.  The rest of the code and logic remain identical.  The component uses Svelte lifecycle methods (`onMount`, `onDestroy`) for managing subscriptions and GTM event firing (`fireGtmEvent`).


## 18:01:24
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/utmDiscount.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 17:26:19 and 17:34:26 on June 26, 2025.  These revisions appear to be minor edits and do not significantly alter the functionality.  The core component remains a form for configuring customer eligibility for discounts, offering options for all customers, new customers, existing customers, Shopify customer segments, and specific customers (via CSV upload).  The code includes robust validation for CSV uploads, ensuring correct format and phone number validity.  Shopify customer segment selection utilizes a multi-select component and updates the form state accordingly.  The changes primarily involve refinements to the UI, error handling, and data handling within the component.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/utmDiscount.tsx` file was modified twice, at 17:45:04 and 17:50:33 on June 26, 2025. The first revision established a component for managing UTM discount configurations, allowing the addition and deletion of UTM parameters linked to specific discount codes. The component features input fields for UTM parameters (source, medium, campaign, term, content), a discount code field, and a toggle for auto-applying the discount.  Validation ensures that UTM Source and Discount Code fields are filled, and prevents duplicate UTM parameter entries. Data is saved using `saveConfig` function. The second revision added a `RenderField` component, likely to improve code organization and reusability by rendering a switch component for auto-applying discount on checkout.  The core functionality of adding, deleting, and saving UTM discount configurations remains unchanged between the two revisions; the primary difference is the integration of the `RenderField` component in the second revision.


## 21:04:59
The log shows several code modifications across multiple React component files within a checkout dashboard UI on June 26th, 2025.  The key changes revolve around enhancements to the analytics and settings pages.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/index.tsx` (26/06/2025, 20:17:49): This file was updated to add a comprehensive settings page for checkout configurations.  It utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and `react-redux` for state management.  The update introduces several configurable discount options, including COD limits, blocked discount codes, tiered discounts, sales channel-specific discounts, UTM-based discounting, dynamic discounts, Buy X at Y discounts, discount applicability rules, discount capping, and gift-with-purchase (GWP) discounts.  Each option is presented with detailed tooltips explaining its configuration and usage.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` (26/06/2025, 20:17:59): This file manages the overall settings navigation.  Significant changes include the addition of new settings sections (Pincodes, Shipping, Customise UI, Discount Configs, Discounts, Bulk Discounts, Payments, Tax & Others, Integrations, Free Gift, Agent Led). The code uses `react-router-dom` for routing,  `react-redux` for state management, and  `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI components.  The structure is designed to conditionally render settings based on user roles and configurations (`isMerchantUser`, `showDiscountConfigs`, `config.diy_enabled`).  It also handles the display and management of a merchant agreement, utilizing API calls.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/website-analytics/index.tsx` (26/06/2025, 20:29:50, 26/06/2025, 20:35:31, 26/06/2025, 20:41:52, 26/06/2025, 20:44:53, 26/06/2025, 20:49:56): This file displays website analytics.  Multiple revisions reflect iterative improvements. Key features include date range selection with comparison capabilities, display of key metrics, and conditional rendering based on `kwikpass_merchant` integration status. It fetches data from the `analytics` store based on selected date ranges and utilizes `single-spa` for navigation to report pages.  The UI is built using the `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The multiple revisions primarily focus on refining the UI presentation and the conditional rendering logic for different scenarios (Kwikpass integration, data availability, date ranges), and updating the segmented control for better navigation between analytics pages.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` (26/06/2025, 20:35:22, 26/06/2025, 20:36:04, 26/06/2025, 20:40:08, 26/06/2025, 20:43:11, 26/06/2025, 20:44:04, 26/06/2025, 20:44:32, 26/06/2025, 20:49:42): This file is responsible for displaying checkout analytics.  Numerous updates reflect a significant amount of refactoring and feature additions.  It involves fetching and displaying data (using `react-redux`), handling date range selection and comparison, and includes functionality for downloading analytics data.  Conditional rendering logic based on  `isShopifyAppCheckoutEnabled` and configuration (`config.enhancer_app`, `config.selected_checkout_charts`, `checkoutPlatformKeys`) is prominent, handling the display of specific charts or data based on user permissions and configuration. The multiple revisions are likely related to bug fixes, UI improvements, and adding more robust data handling and display logic.  The `gokwik-ui-kit` is used consistently throughout.

Overall, the changes demonstrate a concerted effort to improve the dashboard's functionality and user experience by adding comprehensive settings and enhancing analytics reporting.  There's a clear pattern of using `react-redux` for state management,  `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI components, and  `react-router-dom` for navigation.  Conditional rendering based on user roles and configurations plays a substantial role in the dashboard's adaptability.

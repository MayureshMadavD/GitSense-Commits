# Activity Summary for 26/06/2025

## 12:01:23
The log shows code changes on June 26, 2025, primarily focusing on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-page application (SPA) dashboard.

The significant changes involve altering the import map within the `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` tags. These import maps define where different JavaScript modules are loaded from, depending on the `deployedEnv` variable (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The different environments point to different URLs for modules like `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, and others, suggesting a system designed for different deployment stages.  In the production environment, additional scripts for Clarity (tracking/analytics) and New Relic (monitoring) are included.  The local environment uses `localhost` URLs for several modules.

The timestamp for the major changes to `src/index.ejs` is 11:35:48 on June 26, 2025. The file contains a Content Security Policy (CSP) meta tag, which restricts the resources the browser can load to enhance security.  The use of SystemJS import maps and CDN-hosted React and React-DOM libraries indicates a modern JavaScript framework architecture.  The inclusion of `regenerator-runtime` suggests the use of async/await features that may require polyfills for older browsers.

Notably, the file structure implies a modular architecture where different components of the dashboard (configuration, utilities, checkout, payment, etc.) are loaded as separate modules from various URLs.  The consistent pattern of using `@gokwik` as a prefix for module names suggests a consistent internal naming convention.

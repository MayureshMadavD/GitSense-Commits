# Activity Summary for 26/06/2025

## 12:01:23
The log shows code changes on June 26, 2025, primarily focusing on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-page application (SPA) dashboard.

The significant changes involve altering the import map within the `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` tags. These import maps define where different JavaScript modules are loaded from, depending on the `deployedEnv` variable (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The different environments point to different URLs for modules like `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, and others, suggesting a system designed for different deployment stages.  In the production environment, additional scripts for Clarity (tracking/analytics) and New Relic (monitoring) are included.  The local environment uses `localhost` URLs for several modules.

The timestamp for the major changes to `src/index.ejs` is 11:35:48 on June 26, 2025. The file contains a Content Security Policy (CSP) meta tag, which restricts the resources the browser can load to enhance security.  The use of SystemJS import maps and CDN-hosted React and React-DOM libraries indicates a modern JavaScript framework architecture.  The inclusion of `regenerator-runtime` suggests the use of async/await features that may require polyfills for older browsers.

Notably, the file structure implies a modular architecture where different components of the dashboard (configuration, utilities, checkout, payment, etc.) are loaded as separate modules from various URLs.  The consistent pattern of using `@gokwik` as a prefix for module names suggests a consistent internal naming convention.

The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx`**: This file, updated at 12:26:58 on 26/06/2025, primarily concerns the main analytics dashboard.  The update appears to be a minor refactoring, removing unnecessary code and potentially improving performance or readability.  No significant functional changes are apparent in the comparison of the initial and final versions.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 12:12:27 and 12:21:01 on 26/06/2025.  The changes focus on the  `AnalyticsHeader` component, responsible for date selection, sales channel filtering, and screen switching within the analytics dashboard.

* **12:12:27:** Initial commit.  The component included date range pickers with a 90-day limit, sales channel selection (if not a Shopify app), and a segmented control for switching between "Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," and "Website Analytics" views.  The "Discount Analytics" option was disabled if no discount information was present in the URL search parameters.

* **12:13:05:** A minor bug fix in the segmented control, correcting a condition that incorrectly disabled the 'Discount Analytics' option. The condition `disabled: location.search.includes('discount')` changed to `disabled: !location.search.includes('discount')`.

* **12:15:12:** The logic for enabling/disabling "Discount Analytics" was improved. Instead of relying on the presence of "discount" in the URL search parameters, the component now checks for a "coupon" parameter.  This change suggests a shift towards using a more explicit indicator for discount data availability.

* **12:15:41:** The `Segmented` component's options were simplified, removing the conditional disabling of "Discount Analytics". All three options ("Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," and "Website Analytics") are always available.

* **12:15:53:**  "Discount Analytics" was removed from the options array, simplifying the UI.

* **12:16:00:** "Discount Analytics" was reintroduced into the options array.

* **12:18:06:** The `screeOptions` array was introduced to manage the segmented control options dynamically,  making the code more readable.

* **12:20:15:** The logic for conditionally including "Discount Analytics" in the `screeOptions` array was refined, using  `location?.search?.includes('discount')` which accounts for the possibility of `location.search` being null.

* **12:20:26:**  Minor refinement in the conditional inclusion of 'Discount Analytics' in `screeOptions`. The change is primarily stylistic, using `location?.search?.includes('discount')` instead of `location.search.includes('discount')`.

* **12:21:01:** The conditional inclusion of "Discount Analytics" in `screeOptions` was further refined to handle potential null values in `location.search` and ensures that "Discount Analytics" is included as an array element even if the condition is met.


The overall pattern in `/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` shows iterative refinement of the UI logic for showing or hiding the "Discount Analytics" option.  The final version uses a more robust and readable approach to dynamically manage the available analytics screens based on the URL parameters.  The changes to `index.tsx` seem unrelated to these UI refinements and suggest a separate, less impactful code cleanup effort.


## 14:01:32
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` and one revision to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/renderFormItem.tsx`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/renderFormItem.tsx` file was updated twice, with minor changes between 13:35:55 and 13:36:23.  The primary change involved correcting the type of the `label` property in the `CustomField` interface from `any` to `string`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/customerEligibility.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 13:26:46 and 13:58:57.  These changes primarily focused on enhancing the UI component for customer discount eligibility. Key updates include:

* **13:37:14:** Added `Tooltip` component from `gokwik-ui-kit` to provide more information on certain form items.  This suggests an improvement in user experience.

* **13:39:55 - 13:58:57:**  The most significant changes occurred in this period, revolving around the addition of a new `Switch` component for controlling  `utm_discount_visiblity`. The initial implementation included a default `checked` property (13:44:44), which was later modified to reflect the state of the `utmParamInputs` object (13:51:39 and 13:52:15). This `utm_discount_visiblity` is also added as a column to the existing table.  The `onChange` handler for the switch is implemented to update the `utmParamInputs` state accordingly, facilitating two-way data binding. The Tooltip associated with the switch was also updated to better reflect functionality.

* **Throughout the revisions:**  There is consistent use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components (`Alert`, `Button`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Row`, `Col`, `Select`, `Upload`, `Tooltip`, etc.) and functions for API calls and CSV handling.  This indicates a reliance on a specific UI framework and consistent coding practices.

* **CSV Handling:** The component includes robust handling for CSV uploads, including validation checks for empty files, correct formatting, and 10-digit phone number validation.  Error messages are provided through `message.error()` to inform the user of issues.


In summary, the majority of changes focused on improving the user interface of the customer eligibility form within the discount management section, specifically adding a toggle for UTM parameter based discount visibility, and improving the user experience with better tooltips and error messaging. The `renderFormItem` component received only minor, mostly type-related updates.

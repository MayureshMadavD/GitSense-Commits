# Activity Summary for 26/06/2025

## 12:01:23
The log shows code changes on June 26, 2025, primarily focusing on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-page application (SPA) dashboard.

The significant changes involve altering the import map within the `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` tags. These import maps define where different JavaScript modules are loaded from, depending on the `deployedEnv` variable (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The different environments point to different URLs for modules like `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, and others, suggesting a system designed for different deployment stages.  In the production environment, additional scripts for Clarity (tracking/analytics) and New Relic (monitoring) are included.  The local environment uses `localhost` URLs for several modules.

The timestamp for the major changes to `src/index.ejs` is 11:35:48 on June 26, 2025. The file contains a Content Security Policy (CSP) meta tag, which restricts the resources the browser can load to enhance security.  The use of SystemJS import maps and CDN-hosted React and React-DOM libraries indicates a modern JavaScript framework architecture.  The inclusion of `regenerator-runtime` suggests the use of async/await features that may require polyfills for older browsers.

Notably, the file structure implies a modular architecture where different components of the dashboard (configuration, utilities, checkout, payment, etc.) are loaded as separate modules from various URLs.  The consistent pattern of using `@gokwik` as a prefix for module names suggests a consistent internal naming convention.

The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx`**: This file, updated at 12:26:58 on 26/06/2025, primarily concerns the main analytics dashboard.  The update appears to be a minor refactoring, removing unnecessary code and potentially improving performance or readability.  No significant functional changes are apparent in the comparison of the initial and final versions.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 12:12:27 and 12:21:01 on 26/06/2025.  The changes focus on the  `AnalyticsHeader` component, responsible for date selection, sales channel filtering, and screen switching within the analytics dashboard.

* **12:12:27:** Initial commit.  The component included date range pickers with a 90-day limit, sales channel selection (if not a Shopify app), and a segmented control for switching between "Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," and "Website Analytics" views.  The "Discount Analytics" option was disabled if no discount information was present in the URL search parameters.

* **12:13:05:** A minor bug fix in the segmented control, correcting a condition that incorrectly disabled the 'Discount Analytics' option. The condition `disabled: location.search.includes('discount')` changed to `disabled: !location.search.includes('discount')`.

* **12:15:12:** The logic for enabling/disabling "Discount Analytics" was improved. Instead of relying on the presence of "discount" in the URL search parameters, the component now checks for a "coupon" parameter.  This change suggests a shift towards using a more explicit indicator for discount data availability.

* **12:15:41:** The `Segmented` component's options were simplified, removing the conditional disabling of "Discount Analytics". All three options ("Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," and "Website Analytics") are always available.

* **12:15:53:**  "Discount Analytics" was removed from the options array, simplifying the UI.

* **12:16:00:** "Discount Analytics" was reintroduced into the options array.

* **12:18:06:** The `screeOptions` array was introduced to manage the segmented control options dynamically,  making the code more readable.

* **12:20:15:** The logic for conditionally including "Discount Analytics" in the `screeOptions` array was refined, using  `location?.search?.includes('discount')` which accounts for the possibility of `location.search` being null.

* **12:20:26:**  Minor refinement in the conditional inclusion of 'Discount Analytics' in `screeOptions`. The change is primarily stylistic, using `location?.search?.includes('discount')` instead of `location.search.includes('discount')`.

* **12:21:01:** The conditional inclusion of "Discount Analytics" in `screeOptions` was further refined to handle potential null values in `location.search` and ensures that "Discount Analytics" is included as an array element even if the condition is met.


The overall pattern in `/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` shows iterative refinement of the UI logic for showing or hiding the "Discount Analytics" option.  The final version uses a more robust and readable approach to dynamically manage the available analytics screens based on the URL parameters.  The changes to `index.tsx` seem unrelated to these UI refinements and suggest a separate, less impactful code cleanup effort.

# Activity Summary for 08/06/2025

## 11:19:19
The log shows extensive modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui` directory, focusing primarily on the `merchants` component and its subcomponents.  The changes span approximately one hour (from 22:32 to 23:20).

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/chart/chart.jsx`: This file, updated at 22:32:28, introduces two chart components: `MerchantStatusChart` (a bar chart displaying CE data summaries with filtering capabilities) and `AvergeStatusChart` (a composed chart showing average go-live days, average expected ARR, and average blocked merchants).  The `MerchantStatusChart` allows users to select specific CEs for display.  Both charts use the `recharts` library.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx`: This file underwent multiple updates between 22:34:21 and 23:02:19.  The key change is the development of a merchant data table using Ant Design's `Table` component. The table displays various merchant details and allows for filtering and sorting.  The `formFeilds` array defines the fields for a form, likely used for data entry or modification.  A `showDeleteConfirm` function handles user confirmation before deleting merchant entries using the `deletEntryForMerchant` backend function.  The updates throughout this file involve refinements to the table's filtering, data display, and handling.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/extraFunctionForMerchant.jsx`: This file, updated between 23:08:26 and 23:12:05, contains utility functions for the merchants component.  `createOptionsListForFilter` generates filter options from an array. `convertStringtoArray` converts a string to an array and improves the presentation using Ant Design's `Tooltip` to show details. `getNumericFilterDropdown`, `getNumericOnFilter`, `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`, and `getDateRangeOnFilter` facilitate numeric and date range filtering for the merchant table. `exportDataToCsv` handles the export of data to CSV.  `summarizeMerchantData` processes and summarizes merchant data. `averageFinderFunction` calculates averages of go-live days and expected ARR. Finally, `LoadingFunction` renders a loading indicator.  The main change is the improvement of the `convertStringtoArray` function to utilize tooltips for better user experience and the replacement of a custom icon with Ant Design's `InfoCircleOutlined`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/singleMerchants/merchantstatusbar.jsx`:  This file, updated repeatedly between 23:17:28 and 23:20:32,  presents a status bar component that displays the counts of live, pending, on hold, and blocked merchants. The logic for calculating these counts was iteratively refined and corrected through various commits, indicating debugging and refinement of the filter condition.  The changes primarily involve fixing logical errors within the filter conditions for the `pendingCount` calculation.  The inclusion of `console.log(merchantData)` suggests debugging efforts.

# Activity Summary for 16/06/2025

## 12:49:47
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file, last updated on 16/06/2025 at 12:06:16,  defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs and services based on the current environment (`env`).  The environment variable can take values such as `local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `pci-prod`, and others.  Each function dynamically constructs the appropriate URL based on the detected environment.  For example,  `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, and `api_url` all have different URL mappings for various environments.  The code also includes functions for generating tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that also vary based on the environment, with different tokens for development, testing and production environments.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object in a store with sample data, seemingly only triggered when the environment is 'local'. The `cdn_path` function determines the CDN path based on the environment.  The `analytics_api` and `analytics_api_v2` functions manage analytics API endpoints for different environments.  Finally,  `merchant_url` and `merchant_url_api` functions return a merchant URL, defaulting to a localhost URL if the environment is `local`.  The code extensively uses conditional logic to handle the different environment configurations.

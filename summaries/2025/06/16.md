# Activity Summary for 16/06/2025

## 12:49:47
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file, last updated on 16/06/2025 at 12:06:16,  defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs and services based on the current environment (`env`).  The environment variable can take values such as `local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `pci-prod`, and others.  Each function dynamically constructs the appropriate URL based on the detected environment.  For example,  `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, and `api_url` all have different URL mappings for various environments.  The code also includes functions for generating tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that also vary based on the environment, with different tokens for development, testing and production environments.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object in a store with sample data, seemingly only triggered when the environment is 'local'. The `cdn_path` function determines the CDN path based on the environment.  The `analytics_api` and `analytics_api_v2` functions manage analytics API endpoints for different environments.  Finally,  `merchant_url` and `merchant_url_api` functions return a merchant URL, defaulting to a localhost URL if the environment is `local`.  The code extensively uses conditional logic to handle the different environment configurations.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/payment/codLimits.tsx` was modified twice within a short time frame (16/06/2025, 15:37:37 and 16/06/2025, 15:37:46).  Both revisions involved the same component, `CodLimits`, which handles setting COD (Cash on Delivery) limits. The core functionality remained unchanged; the only difference lies within a validation rule inside the `fields` array.

Specifically, the validation for the `cod_lower_limit` field was altered. The initial version used `value > form.getFieldValue('cod_limit')` to check if the lower limit is greater than the upper limit.  The second revision corrected this to `value >= form.getFieldValue('cod_limit')`, ensuring that the lower limit is strictly less than the upper limit.  This subtle change prevents a scenario where both limits could be equal, forcing the lower limit to be genuinely lower.  No other parts of the code were modified in either commit.

The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/payment/codLimits.tsx`.

The `discountAnalytics.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 15:58:32 and 16:41:24 on June 16, 2025.  These changes primarily involved refinements to the UI for displaying discount analytics.  Specific updates include:

* **15:58:32:** Initial commit showing a comprehensive React component for displaying various discount analytics data, including metric cards, tables, charts (bar and line), and filter options. The component uses several custom components and helper functions.

* **16:00:16 & 16:01:11:**  Minor code formatting changes; no functional alterations.

* **16:15:48:** Added a `DownloadIcon` component to the 'Overall Discount Usage Trend' section for download functionality, also passing `formattedDates` prop to the component.

* **16:27:11:** Updated the `DownloadIcon` to include an `apiKey` prop, likely for differentiating download requests.  The `apiKey`  was set to `discountStats` in this commit.

* **16:34:59:** Removed `sectionProps` from `DiscountBarChart` and moved it to `AnalyticsCard`. This refactoring simplifies the component structure, embedding the download functionality within the `AnalyticsCard` component.

* **16:41:24:**  Further refactoring of the `DiscountBarChart` section. Each bar chart is now wrapped in an `AnalyticsCard` component, allowing for individual download options using different API keys (`discountStats` and `discountFailures`). This enhances data management and organization.  The `apiKey` prop within the DownloadIcon component was appropriately updated for both bar charts.

Throughout the changes in `discountAnalytics.tsx`, there's a consistent pattern of using custom components (`AnalyticsCard`, `DiscountBarChart`, `DiscountMetricCard`, `SectionHeader`), functions (`getDiscountAnalyticsData`, `getUniqueOptions`, `useDiscountBifurcationData`, `setDiscountTypeOverviewData`, `formatLastUpdateAt`), and data structures to present discount data in a structured and reusable manner.  The updates mainly focus on improving the user interface and adding download functionality.

The `codLimits.tsx` file was updated at 16:49:04 on June 16, 2025. This file contains a React component for managing COD (Cash on Delivery) limits in settings.  The update includes: a form for setting upper and lower limits for COD, validation to ensure the lower limit is less than the upper limit, and an informational alert linking to relevant Kwik Flow settings. The component uses a custom hook (`useMerchantConfigApi`) for API interactions and rendering form elements using a helper function (`RenderField`).  There is a clear separation between form logic, API calls, and UI presentation.

The log shows multiple revisions to two React component files: `codLimits.tsx` and `discountAnalytics.tsx`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/payment/codLimits.tsx` underwent three revisions between 16:50:04 and 16:51:09 on June 16, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on refining the validation rules within the `validator` function for the COD lower and upper limit input fields.  The core functionality remained consistent, involving fetching and saving COD limit configurations using a custom hook (`useMerchantConfigApi`).  The minor revisions improved the validation logic, particularly handling cases where the lower limit is zero or equal to the upper limit.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/discountAnalytics.tsx` was modified extensively between 16:56:35 and 17:26:15 on June 16, 2025. This file displays discount analytics.  The changes involved a significant restructuring of the component's visual presentation using the `gokwik-ui-kit` library.  Initially, the component used `SectionHeader` and `Table` components to display data. This was gradually replaced with `AnalyticsCard` to encapsulate each section. The `discountAnalytics.tsx` file consistently uses various functions from `../analytics-component/commonFunctions` for data manipulation and display. Several revisions focused on simplifying the UI, removing unnecessary components such as `SectionHeader`, replacing them with `AnalyticsCard`.  There's also a recurring pattern of adding `DownloadIcon` components for download functionality across various sections of the analytics dashboard.  The `pagination` property in the `Table` components is changed from `true` to `false` in multiple revisions between 17:01:17 and 17:26:15.  The `multiKeyValue` prop in the `Chart` component was removed at 17:26:15, potentially simplifying the chart's data handling.

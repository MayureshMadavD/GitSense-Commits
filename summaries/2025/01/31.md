# Activity Summary for 31/01/2025

## 11:51:44
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`, a React component for a rich text editor.  All changes occurred on January 31st, 2025, within a short time frame (approximately 30 minutes).

The core functionality of the rich text editor remains consistent throughout the edits, providing options for bold, italic, underline, and link formatting.  The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements.


The primary changes focus on the `handleInputChange` function and the character counter display:

* **11:46:17:** Initial version of the component.  The character counter displays `textCount?.length - 1` or `textCount?.length` if the length is less than 1. Text trimming is done if `text.length > 64`.


* **11:47:23:** Minor adjustment within the `handleInputChange` function. The condition for trimming text changes from `text.length > 64` to `text.length >= 64`.

* **11:48:17:** No discernible changes from the previous version.


* **11:49:14:** The character counter's display is modified. Instead of subtracting 1 from `textCount?.length`, it now displays either `textCount?.length` or `0` when `textCount?.length - 1 < 0`.


* **11:49:28:**  The character counter is further corrected to display `textCount?.length` instead of `0` when `textCount?.length -1 < 0`. This is likely a final fix for the character counting logic.


In summary, the series of edits mainly involves refining the text input handling and character counting within the rich text editor component. There were no significant structural changes to the component's functionality. The final version correctly displays the character count and trims text exceeding the 64-character limit.

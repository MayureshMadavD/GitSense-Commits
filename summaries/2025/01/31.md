# Activity Summary for 31/01/2025

## 11:51:44
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`, a React component for a rich text editor.  All changes occurred on January 31st, 2025, within a short time frame (approximately 30 minutes).

The core functionality of the rich text editor remains consistent throughout the edits, providing options for bold, italic, underline, and link formatting.  The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements.


The primary changes focus on the `handleInputChange` function and the character counter display:

* **11:46:17:** Initial version of the component.  The character counter displays `textCount?.length - 1` or `textCount?.length` if the length is less than 1. Text trimming is done if `text.length > 64`.


* **11:47:23:** Minor adjustment within the `handleInputChange` function. The condition for trimming text changes from `text.length > 64` to `text.length >= 64`.

* **11:48:17:** No discernible changes from the previous version.


* **11:49:14:** The character counter's display is modified. Instead of subtracting 1 from `textCount?.length`, it now displays either `textCount?.length` or `0` when `textCount?.length - 1 < 0`.


* **11:49:28:**  The character counter is further corrected to display `textCount?.length` instead of `0` when `textCount?.length -1 < 0`. This is likely a final fix for the character counting logic.


In summary, the series of edits mainly involves refining the text input handling and character counting within the rich text editor component. There were no significant structural changes to the component's functionality. The final version correctly displays the character count and trims text exceeding the 64-character limit.

The log shows multiple revisions of a React component, `RichTextEditor`, located at `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`.  The primary focus of the changes is on updating how the component handles the `selectedValue` prop, which presumably represents the initial or updated text content of the rich text editor.


Initially, the component used `useEffect` with `selectedValue` in the dependency array to update the editor's innerHTML.  Between 12:02:47 and 12:03:07, this dependency array was changed to an empty array (`[]`), likely to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  This was reverted shortly after. Subsequent commits at 12:03:58, 12:05:25, 12:06:10, 12:06:30, 12:07:02, 12:08:22, 12:08:34, 12:09:51, 12:10:20, 12:11:08, 12:11:27, 12:11:52 and 12:12:16 involved further experimentation with the `useEffect` hook, toggling between using `innerHTML` and `innerText` to update the editor, experimenting with `useMemo`,  and adding a `setTimeout` function (12:11:52) and finally settling on using `innerHTML` and including `selectedValue` in the dependency array (12:11:08 and 12:12:16) to ensure updates happen when the prop changes.  The `console.log` statements added throughout these commits suggest debugging efforts to track the updates.  The final, stable version at 12:12:16 correctly reflects the dependency of the `useEffect` to the `selectedValue` prop.  Finally, at 12:22:20, the `useEffect` hook responsible for updating the editor's content was removed entirely.  This might indicate that the initial update logic was refactored or made redundant through other means within the component.

Throughout all revisions, the core functionality of the `RichTextEditor` remained consistent:  providing buttons for bold, italic, underline, and link formatting; handling text input and length limitations (64 characters); and utilizing a Popover for URL input.  The changes primarily center around optimizing and debugging the update mechanism for the editor's content based on changes to the `selectedValue` prop.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file, updated on 31/01/2025 at 12:35:05, defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the environment (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  The environment is determined by the `env` variable, which is subscribed to changes in the `store_environment` observable.  The code includes a large number of conditional statements to handle different environments, resulting in many different URLs for various APIs (health service, address suggestions, core API, experiment API, Twidpay API, KP API, analytics API (v1 and v2), and CDN path).  Specific URLs are defined for each environment, often with variations for `dev`, `qa` (with sub-environments like `qa-rto` and `qaone`), `sandbox`, and `production`.  There's also logic to handle the `local` environment, using different URLs or localhost addresses for testing purposes.  Additionally, functions  `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` return different tokens based on the environment.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object within the `local` environment, populating it with sample data.  The code extensively uses conditional logic based on the environment variable `env` to dynamically set API URLs and other configurations.  There is a clear pattern of using distinct base URLs for different environments, reflecting a strategy for managing development, testing, and production deployments separately.

# Activity Summary for 25/01/2025

## 03:43:12
The log shows two updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/.env` file.  Both updates at  25/01/2025, with a time difference of approximately two minutes, primarily modify the `PARENT_EMAIL` variable. The first entry sets `PARENT_EMAIL` to `mintupdates@gokwik.co`, while the second entry changes it to `mayuresh.madav@gokwik.co`.  All other environment variables remain consistent across both updates.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file was updated on 25/01/2025 at 12:40:24.  The update primarily involves creating and sending daily and weekly email reports.

The code defines several functions:

* **`POST`**: This handles incoming POST requests, saving daily and weekly report data (imageData, headerName, reportId) to a database via the `pngReportData` function.

* **`dailyReportTriggerTime`**: This function schedules a cron job to run `sendDailyReport` daily at 1:30 AM UTC (Asia/Kolkata timezone).

* **`sendDailyReport`**: This retrieves daily reports from the database (`getPngReportByTodayDate`), filters for reports with non-'NA' dailyReport data, and sends an email using the `sendEmailForReport` function.  It uses `getCurrentDate` to get the current date for the email subject.

* **`sendWeeklyReport`**:  (Currently commented out in the cron job scheduling) This is similar to `sendDailyReport` but retrieves and sends weekly reports. It uses `getPreviousDate` to get the previous date.

* **`sendEmailForReport`**: This function constructs and sends an email using Nodemailer.  It takes headerName, date, imageData, and reportType ('Daily' or 'Weekly') as input.  It uses environment variables (presumably stored elsewhere) for email host, port, SMTP credentials, and recipient email address.

* **`GET`**: This handles GET requests, currently triggering `sendDailyReport` and returning a status message indicating cron job status.  A commented-out call to `dailyReportTriggerTime()` suggests it might be used for starting the cron job at some point.


The code uses `date-fns` for date formatting, `nodemailer` for sending emails, and `node-cron` for scheduling tasks.  The database interaction is abstracted through functions like `pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, and `deletepngReportData` (the latter currently only used in a commented-out section).  Error handling is included using try-catch blocks.  The code structure suggests a system for generating and emailing daily and weekly reports based on data stored in a database. The scheduled task for weekly reports is currently commented out.

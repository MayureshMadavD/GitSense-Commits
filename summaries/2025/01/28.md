# Activity Summary for 28/01/2025

## 11:03:59
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` file between 10:41 AM and 11:02 AM on January 28, 2025.  The file is a React component (`BrandForm`) responsible for handling brand customization in a settings page.

The primary focus of the changes is the logo upload functionality within the form.  Initially, the `handleUpload` function contained complex logic involving multiple API calls (`makeAPICall`) to handle both updating existing logos and uploading new ones. There were calls to `APIEndPoints.downlaodLogo`, `APIEndPoints.presingedLogoUrl`, and `APIEndPoints.updateMerchant`.  The code underwent simplification; unnecessary `fetch` calls for logo updates were removed in subsequent commits, streamlining the process to primarily use `makeAPICall` with the `PUT` method.  The `method` in the API call to update the merchant's logo changed from `post` to `put` reflecting a correction in the update logic.  The commented-out sections in the 10:45:40 and later commits suggest a deliberate removal of redundant code.  No significant changes were made to the UI elements of the component.  The minor changes made suggest debugging and refinement of the API interaction.


## 12:04:06
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` on January 28, 2025.  The file is a React component (`BrandForm`) responsible for managing brand customization in a settings page.

The primary focus of the changes is on the logo upload functionality.  Initially, the code contained commented-out sections related to logo updates.  Subsequent revisions progressively refined the logo upload process.  Specifically:

* **11:12:43:**  The initial version shows an incomplete logo upload process with commented-out API calls. The component fetches brand details (background color, text color, logo) from a Redux store and an API.  A `getBase64` function converts uploaded images to base64 for display.  Logo validation checks file type and size.

* **11:15:22 - 11:24:39:** These revisions involve minor adjustments and debugging, including adding logging statements to track the logo URL (`console.log(res,"logo url")` and later `console.log(res,"new response")`). The most significant change in this period involves moving the `makeAPICall` to update the merchant logo after successful upload.

* **11:30:12:** The dependency array in the primary `useEffect` hook was changed from `[merchant_details, config]` to `[]`, likely to improve performance by removing unnecessary re-renders.


* **11:39:49:**  Another `useEffect` hook was added to log `merchant_details` whenever it changes.

* **11:53:03 - 11:59:41:** Significant changes occurred in this period.  The `imgUrl` state was changed from a string to an object `{imgUrl: '', imgPath: ''}` to store both the image URL and path separately.  The `onFinish` function, which handles form submission and updates the logo, was significantly modified. Now it explicitly makes an API call to update the merchant logo (`process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL + APIEndPoints.updateMerchant(merchant_details.m_id)`) after a successful upload using the stored `imgPath`.  Error handling and success messages (`message.success("Logo Update SuccessFull")`) were added, improving user experience.  The `isVisible` state, which controls the "Save Changes" button, is managed to reflect the updated state.

* **12:01:06 - 12:01:52:** Minor adjustments in error handling and success message wording ("Logo Updated Successfully") within the `onFinish` function. The `isVisible` state is corrected to reflect the saving process properly.  The unnecessary `fetchUploadedLogoURL` API call was removed, simplifying the process and using `isLogoPresentForCurrentMerchant` to fetch updated logo URL.


Throughout the revisions, the core functionality remained consistent: fetching initial brand data, handling logo uploads with validation, updating the UI, and making API calls to persist changes.  The changes show a clear progression towards a more robust and efficient implementation of the logo upload feature.  The frequent changes between 11:53:03 and 12:01:52 suggest intensive debugging and refinement of the logo update process.


## 13:04:05
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/user/index.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx`.

The `index.ts` file underwent two minor updates on January 28, 2025, at 12:23:14 and 12:23:30.  The first change involved the initial commit. The second change exported the `updatedLogoData` action along with `setUserData`.  These changes suggest the addition of functionality for updating logo data within the user store.

The `brand.tsx` file, containing a React component (`BrandForm`),  shows extensive modifications between January 28, 2025, 12:23:48 and 13:02:42.  The most significant changes were:


* **12:28:59:**  Import of `useAppDispatch` and `updatedLogoData` from `@store/user`, indicating a shift to using Redux dispatch for updating logo data.

* **12:29:40 - 12:37:49:** Several commits focused on refining the logo upload functionality.  The primary change within this period involved changing the HTTP method used to upload the logo from a POST request to a PUT request, for better idempotency. There were also minor changes involving debugging using console logs and minor syntax changes

* **12:40:38:** The `onFinish` function was updated to use `form.getFieldsValue()` to access form data before making API calls and adding console logging for debugging.

* **12:50:04 - 12:53:16:** Further debugging with additional console logs in the `fetchUploadedLogoURL` and `handleUpload` functions.  The code for the HTTP method used for logo upload also changed between PUT and FETCH.

* **12:55:44:** The `onFinish` function was updated to include a call to `saveConfig`, indicating that the component now handles saving both logo and theme configurations.

* **12:57:07 - 13:02:42:** The primary color value in the `saveConfig` function was updated several times, seemingly in an attempt to refine the color handling during the saving process. The final commit improved the `saveConfig` function to use spread syntax to preserve existing configurations.

Throughout the modifications of `brand.tsx`, there's a recurring pattern of using `makeAPICall` for API interactions,  `useEffect` hooks for managing side effects, and state management using `useState` and `useSelector` from `react-redux`. The component handles logo uploads, theme color selection (primary and text colors), and interacts with backend APIs for presigned URLs, logo downloads, and merchant details updates.  The repeated modifications suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the logo upload and configuration saving mechanisms.


## 14:04:03
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx` between 13:04 and 14:02 on January 28, 2025.

The `brand.tsx` file underwent extensive modifications focusing primarily on the handling of brand logo uploads and color selections.  Initial versions had issues with updating the UI after a color change, as well as missing error handling for API calls and incorrect conditional rendering around the `Save Changes` button.  Several commits addressed these, with a key change at around 13:11 improving the reactivity to color changes by separating the effects handling logo and theme updates.  A further modification at 13:24 added a condition to prevent API calls for logo updates if no image path is present and finally added `setIsVisible(true)` to enable the Save Changes button after a successful update.

The `colorpicker.tsx` file was revised to improve the handling of default color values.  Early versions contained unnecessary console logs and  had issues with handling undefined or improperly formatted color codes. These were fixed between 13:29 and 14:02, with a significant change at 14:02 introducing a `processColor` function to sanitize and format color values, preventing errors caused by unexpected input.  A further significant change at 13:52 introduced the use of `useEffect` and `useState` to manage the color state, improving the component's responsiveness to prop changes. The final version ensures proper default values and robust handling of potentially null or undefined inputs for color values.  Several intermediate versions showed debugging attempts involving `console.log` statements to track the `defaultValues` prop, specifically focusing on its type and contents.


## 15:04:02
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx`.  The majority of changes are between 14:04 and 14:15 on 28/01/2025.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx`:** This file, a React component (`BrandForm`), manages brand customization settings.  Significant changes include:

* **Logo Upload:**  The component handles logo uploads, validating file type and size (under 2MB),  fetching a pre-signed URL, and uploading the logo using a `PUT` request.  The logo is displayed using an `<img>` tag.  The timestamp of the logo-related changes ranges from 14:04:05 to 14:15:13.
* **Color Picker Integration:** A color picker component (`ColorPicketComponent`) is integrated for selecting primary and text colors. These color values are saved in `brandData`.
* **Data Handling:** The component uses `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch` from `react-redux` to interact with the Redux store. It fetches and updates merchant details, including the logo and color scheme.
* **API Calls:** Multiple API calls (`makeAPICall`) are made to handle logo uploads, fetching existing logos and updating merchant configurations. The use of `APIEndPoints` suggests a well-structured API.
* **Configuration Saving:**  Uses `useMerchantConfigApi` hook to save the updated configuration. A final noteworthy change at 14:15:13 involved updating the `saveConfig` function to use the `brandData` as fallback values for primary and text color in the event that the form fields are undefined.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx`:** This file contains a reusable React component (`ColorPicketComponent`) for selecting colors.  The major modifications concentrated around improving the `processColor` function, occurring between 14:04:45 and 14:13:10.

* **Color Formatting:** The `processColor` function is repeatedly refined to ensure proper color string formatting (`#hex`) before sending them for display or storage.  The initial versions contained minor logic flaws related to handling undefined or non-string input that were addressed in subsequent commits.  There is repeated console logging of the color values in different iterations of the component.

In summary, the code changes reflect the development of a UI component for brand customization, focusing on logo uploading and color scheme management, with several iterations to improve the robustness of color handling and configuration saving.  The rapid succession of commits in the `/library/components/colorpicker.tsx` file suggests quick iterative debugging and refinement of the color processing logic.


## 16:04:02
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` between 15:44 and 16:01 on January 28, 2025.  The file is a React component for a login settings page.

The primary changes revolve around the handling and presentation of login customization options:

* **15:44:39 - 15:44:45:** A minor correction was made in `handleFormSubmit`.  The `isBannerVisible` state was incorrectly set to `t` (likely a typo) and was corrected to `true`.

* **15:47:45 - 15:48:26:** No discernible changes in code.  Likely a save or commit without code alteration.

* **15:48:26 - 15:50:42:** No discernible changes in code.  Likely a save or commit without code alteration.

* **15:50:42 - 15:54:12:**  A new file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` was created, containing various TypeScript interfaces for data structures related to orders, carts, transactions, refunds, and other checkout-related information. This suggests a restructuring or expansion of the application's data handling capabilities.


* **15:54:12 - 15:54:18:**  The `login.tsx` component was modified. The `saveConfig` function was changed to nest `loginData` within a `login_data` key within the `custom_config` object. This is a structural change to how login settings are stored in the application's configuration.

* **15:54:18 - 15:59:32:** An `useEffect` hook was added to `login.tsx`. This hook now populates the `loginData` state with data from `config.custom_config.login_data` if available, ensuring that the component reflects the current configuration on mount.

* **15:59:32 - 16:01:42:** The `ColorPicketComponent` in `renderFormItem` was updated. The default values for `firstColor` and `secondColor` now pull their values from `loginData['background-color']` and `loginData['text-color']` respectively, allowing for dynamic default color selection based on existing login settings.


Throughout the revisions, the core functionality of the `login.tsx` component remains consistent.  It provides a form for customizing the login screen, including banner content, button text, and consent section text, utilizing components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and custom components like `RichTextEditor` and `ColorPicketComponent`.  The changes mostly focus on improving data handling, especially integrating with a backend configuration API (`useMerchantConfigApi`) and enhancing the user experience by providing dynamic defaults in the color picker.


## 17:04:02
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx`.  The changes span from 16:06:13 to 16:58:24 on January 28, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx`: This file, a React component for a login settings section, underwent significant changes.  Early revisions focused on setting up state management for visibility of different form elements (banner, logo, consent section, input field) and handling user input for rich text editors and an input field for primary button text.  The `useEffect` hook was modified repeatedly to efficiently fetch and update UI data based on the `config` object from `useMerchantConfigApi`. A crucial change at 16:11:47 set the visibility states to `true` upon initial configuration load. Later revisions (around 16:30:33) simplified the `initialValues` object, removing unnecessary fields. The most substantial changes occurred around 16:44:32, where the `renderFormItem` function was modified to accept a `responseText` prop, improving how the rich text editor handles pre-filled content.  The final revision at 16:39:05 and 16:44:32 focused on refining the UI update logic, specifically improving the handling of `isBannerVisible` within the state updates triggered by the form's `onValuesChange` event.


`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx`: This file, a reusable color picker component, saw minor revisions between 16:28:49 and 16:31:38. The primary changes involved removing unnecessary `useEffect` and `useState` hooks, and refining the `processColor` function for better handling of color string inputs.  The core functionality of the color picker remained unchanged; only minor improvements in the handling of default color values and the removal of redundant logging statements were implemented.


## 18:04:02
The log shows modifications to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/` directory.  Both files, `mobile.tsx` and `coupons.tsx`, are React components dealing with UI customization for a checkout dashboard.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx`:** This file underwent two edits within a minute of each other (17:54:03 and 17:55:06).  The changes appear minor and likely involve code cleanup or refactoring.  The component renders a mobile UI preview, dynamically displaying sections (brand, login, payments, address, coupons) based on the `tabs` prop.  It incorporates UI elements from `gokwik-ui-kit`, displays discount offers (conditionally showing available and unavailable offers), and uses state management (`useState`, `useEffect`) for managing active tabs and UI updates. The conditional rendering is extensive, adapting the UI based on the active tab and data received as props (`brandData`, `loginData`, etc.).

**`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/coupons.tsx`:** This file was modified at 18:03:38. The component is a settings panel for managing coupons or discounts.  It fetches discount data using Redux (`useAppDispatch`, `fetchManualDiscountsDataAsync`), interacts with a merchant configuration API (`useMerchantConfigApi`), and renders a table of coupons with edit and delete functionalities.  The component manages a form for updating coupon settings (including a `Switch` for enabling the recommended offer),  uses a `Radio.Group` for choosing discount types, and integrates with a drag-and-drop component (`OfferSortOrder`) for reordering discounts.  There's also error handling using `message` from `gokwik-ui-kit` and conditional rendering based on whether any discounts have been configured.  The component allows for saving changes to the coupon configuration and displays a guide link.

In summary, the changes reflect ongoing development and refinement of the checkout dashboard's UI customization features.  The `mobile.tsx` component focuses on the visual representation of different checkout steps, while `coupons.tsx` manages the backend configuration and display of coupon/discount settings. The use of conditional rendering, state management, and API interaction are common patterns across both components.

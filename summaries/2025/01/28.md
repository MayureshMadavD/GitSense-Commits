# Activity Summary for 28/01/2025

## 11:03:59
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` file between 10:41 AM and 11:02 AM on January 28, 2025.  The file is a React component (`BrandForm`) responsible for handling brand customization in a settings page.

The primary focus of the changes is the logo upload functionality within the form.  Initially, the `handleUpload` function contained complex logic involving multiple API calls (`makeAPICall`) to handle both updating existing logos and uploading new ones. There were calls to `APIEndPoints.downlaodLogo`, `APIEndPoints.presingedLogoUrl`, and `APIEndPoints.updateMerchant`.  The code underwent simplification; unnecessary `fetch` calls for logo updates were removed in subsequent commits, streamlining the process to primarily use `makeAPICall` with the `PUT` method.  The `method` in the API call to update the merchant's logo changed from `post` to `put` reflecting a correction in the update logic.  The commented-out sections in the 10:45:40 and later commits suggest a deliberate removal of redundant code.  No significant changes were made to the UI elements of the component.  The minor changes made suggest debugging and refinement of the API interaction.

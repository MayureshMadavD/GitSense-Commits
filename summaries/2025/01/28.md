# Activity Summary for 28/01/2025

## 11:03:59
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` file between 10:41 AM and 11:02 AM on January 28, 2025.  The file is a React component (`BrandForm`) responsible for handling brand customization in a settings page.

The primary focus of the changes is the logo upload functionality within the form.  Initially, the `handleUpload` function contained complex logic involving multiple API calls (`makeAPICall`) to handle both updating existing logos and uploading new ones. There were calls to `APIEndPoints.downlaodLogo`, `APIEndPoints.presingedLogoUrl`, and `APIEndPoints.updateMerchant`.  The code underwent simplification; unnecessary `fetch` calls for logo updates were removed in subsequent commits, streamlining the process to primarily use `makeAPICall` with the `PUT` method.  The `method` in the API call to update the merchant's logo changed from `post` to `put` reflecting a correction in the update logic.  The commented-out sections in the 10:45:40 and later commits suggest a deliberate removal of redundant code.  No significant changes were made to the UI elements of the component.  The minor changes made suggest debugging and refinement of the API interaction.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` on January 28, 2025.  The file is a React component (`BrandForm`) responsible for managing brand customization in a settings page.

The primary focus of the changes is on the logo upload functionality.  Initially, the code contained commented-out sections related to logo updates.  Subsequent revisions progressively refined the logo upload process.  Specifically:

* **11:12:43:**  The initial version shows an incomplete logo upload process with commented-out API calls. The component fetches brand details (background color, text color, logo) from a Redux store and an API.  A `getBase64` function converts uploaded images to base64 for display.  Logo validation checks file type and size.

* **11:15:22 - 11:24:39:** These revisions involve minor adjustments and debugging, including adding logging statements to track the logo URL (`console.log(res,"logo url")` and later `console.log(res,"new response")`). The most significant change in this period involves moving the `makeAPICall` to update the merchant logo after successful upload.

* **11:30:12:** The dependency array in the primary `useEffect` hook was changed from `[merchant_details, config]` to `[]`, likely to improve performance by removing unnecessary re-renders.


* **11:39:49:**  Another `useEffect` hook was added to log `merchant_details` whenever it changes.

* **11:53:03 - 11:59:41:** Significant changes occurred in this period.  The `imgUrl` state was changed from a string to an object `{imgUrl: '', imgPath: ''}` to store both the image URL and path separately.  The `onFinish` function, which handles form submission and updates the logo, was significantly modified. Now it explicitly makes an API call to update the merchant logo (`process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL + APIEndPoints.updateMerchant(merchant_details.m_id)`) after a successful upload using the stored `imgPath`.  Error handling and success messages (`message.success("Logo Update SuccessFull")`) were added, improving user experience.  The `isVisible` state, which controls the "Save Changes" button, is managed to reflect the updated state.

* **12:01:06 - 12:01:52:** Minor adjustments in error handling and success message wording ("Logo Updated Successfully") within the `onFinish` function. The `isVisible` state is corrected to reflect the saving process properly.  The unnecessary `fetchUploadedLogoURL` API call was removed, simplifying the process and using `isLogoPresentForCurrentMerchant` to fetch updated logo URL.


Throughout the revisions, the core functionality remained consistent: fetching initial brand data, handling logo uploads with validation, updating the UI, and making API calls to persist changes.  The changes show a clear progression towards a more robust and efficient implementation of the logo upload feature.  The frequent changes between 11:53:03 and 12:01:52 suggest intensive debugging and refinement of the logo update process.

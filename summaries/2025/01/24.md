# Activity Summary for 24/01/2025

## 03:54:11
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file and the `.env` file.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/backend/query.js` file also received several updates but the content remained largely the same across these changes.

The `route.ts` file primarily focuses on sending daily and weekly email reports.  It uses Nodemailer for email sending, and `date-fns` for date formatting.  There's a cron job scheduled to trigger `sendDailyReport()` at 1:30 AM UTC (Asia/Kolkata timezone). The weekly report function (`sendWeeklyReport()`) is commented out.  Changes to this file involved adding logging statements (e.g., `console.log('Reports:', reports)`), hardcoding a specific date  ("23-January-2025") in `sendDailyReport()` at one point, and removing a call to `deletepngReportData()`.

The `.env` file contains environment variables, notably the `PARENT_EMAIL` variable underwent multiple changes, switching between  `mintupdates@gokwik.co` and `mayuresh.madav@gokwik.co` at different timestamps.  This suggests the recipient of the reports was being updated during the development process.  The other environment variables remain consistent throughout the log.

The `backend/query.js` file appears to contain database interaction functions using Prisma. Multiple functions are present for user management, team management, and merchant data retrieval.  No significant changes to its content are observed across the multiple timestamps.  The changes to this file appear to be minor and might relate to version control or refactoring but without diffs it's hard to be certain.  The repeated commits without changes may be due to a faulty version control system, or a staging environment being updated.

# Activity Summary for 24/01/2025

## 03:54:11
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file and the `.env` file.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/backend/query.js` file also received several updates but the content remained largely the same across these changes.

The `route.ts` file primarily focuses on sending daily and weekly email reports.  It uses Nodemailer for email sending, and `date-fns` for date formatting.  There's a cron job scheduled to trigger `sendDailyReport()` at 1:30 AM UTC (Asia/Kolkata timezone). The weekly report function (`sendWeeklyReport()`) is commented out.  Changes to this file involved adding logging statements (e.g., `console.log('Reports:', reports)`), hardcoding a specific date  ("23-January-2025") in `sendDailyReport()` at one point, and removing a call to `deletepngReportData()`.

The `.env` file contains environment variables, notably the `PARENT_EMAIL` variable underwent multiple changes, switching between  `mintupdates@gokwik.co` and `mayuresh.madav@gokwik.co` at different timestamps.  This suggests the recipient of the reports was being updated during the development process.  The other environment variables remain consistent throughout the log.

The `backend/query.js` file appears to contain database interaction functions using Prisma. Multiple functions are present for user management, team management, and merchant data retrieval.  No significant changes to its content are observed across the multiple timestamps.  The changes to this file appear to be minor and might relate to version control or refactoring but without diffs it's hard to be certain.  The repeated commits without changes may be due to a faulty version control system, or a staging environment being updated.

The log shows code changes on January 24, 2025, primarily focused on updating the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file. This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-spa application.

The significant changes involve modifying the import map, which defines how modules are loaded.  Different import maps are generated based on the `deployedEnv` variable (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  Each environment points to different URLs for various Gokwik services (@gokwik/configuration, @gokwik/utilities, etc.).  The local environment uses a mix of localhost URLs and other remote URLs, while other environments consistently use URLs under `dev.gokwik.in` (with variations of `dev`, `qa`, and `sandbox` prefixes) and `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.  The production environment additionally includes Clarity and New Relic instrumentation scripts, indicating a focus on production monitoring.  The New Relic instrumentation is particularly comprehensive, suggesting a robust approach to performance and error monitoring. The code includes detailed comments explaining the purpose of various script inclusions and CSP policies, showcasing best practices. The timestamp of the `index.ejs` modification (11:51:27) is shortly after the `.env` file modification, suggesting a potential relationship, where environment-specific URLs from the `.env` file may ultimately influence the generated import map in `index.ejs`.  The consistent structure of the import map across environments indicates a well-organized approach to configuration management.


## 17:03:17
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`  and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` files between 16:05:05 and 16:46:28 on January 24, 2025.  The `MerchantAPI.ts` file underwent numerous revisions, primarily focusing on refining existing functions and not adding new ones. Changes seem to involve consistent adjustments to how requests are made, likely to improve error handling and data consistency.  There's a recurring pattern of handling `merchantInfo.mmData` and incorporating custom handling parameters (`cf_user_customer_id`, `cf_user_id`, `cf_dimension_id`, `cf_session_id`, `bikCustomerId`) across many API calls. The `EnvironmentService.ts` file shows extensive updates to its environment-based URL configurations, demonstrating a continuous adjustment of API endpoints based on the environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.). The `merchant.html` file updates involve modification of the `window.merchantInfo` object, primarily changes to the `mid` value.  The numerous updates to `MerchantAPI.ts` suggest iterative debugging or feature refinement rather than a major overhaul.  The consistent use of `requestId` in multiple functions suggests a strong focus on request tracking and management. The frequent updates to the `EnvironmentService.ts`  file  indicate ongoing work on supporting multiple environments within the application.

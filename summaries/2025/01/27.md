# Activity Summary for 27/01/2025

## 11:04:07
The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file, updated on 27/01/2025 at 10:09:34, is an API route handling email sending for daily and weekly reports.  The key functionality revolves around scheduled tasks using `node-cron`.

**Key Changes/Features:**

* **POST Request:**  Accepts image data, header name, and report ID (1 for daily, 2 for weekly) to save report data.  It uses the `pngReportData` function from the backend.

* **Scheduled Tasks:** Uses `node-cron` to schedule:
    * A daily report task running at 1:30 AM UTC (Asia/Kolkata timezone). This fetches daily reports, filters for non-'NA' entries, and sends an email using the `sendEmailForReport` function.  If sending is successful, it deletes the report data using `deletepngReportData`.
    * A (commented-out) weekly report task running at 1:00 AM UTC on Mondays.  The logic is similar to the daily task, but uses `getPreviousDate` and filters for weekly reports.

* **Email Sending:** The `sendEmailForReport` function uses `nodemailer` to send emails.  The email contains an embedded image from the base64 encoded `imageData`. It retrieves email credentials from environment variables (not shown due to security concerns).

* **Data Handling:** Functions `getPngReportByTodayDate` and `deletepngReportData` interact with a database (presumably) to manage report data.  `getCurrentDate` and `getPreviousDate` handle date retrieval.

* **GET Request:** A GET request triggers the `dailyReportTriggerTime` function, which sets up the cron job for daily reports and returns the current date and time.

In essence, this code implements a system for automatically generating and emailing daily and weekly reports based on data stored in a backend database.  The commented-out weekly report task suggests it might be under development or temporarily disabled.  The significant timestamp is 27/01/2025, 10:09:34, reflecting the last update to this file.


## 12:04:07
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` between 11:13:29 and 12:02:03 on January 27, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the implementation of logo retrieval and display within a brand customization form.

Initially (11:13:29), the component directly used `merchant_details` from Redux to populate brand data, including the logo.  The logo was displayed using a local `getBase64` function.


Subsequent revisions (11:53:07, 11:55:09, 11:56:45, 11:56:52) introduced an `async` function `getCurrentLogo`, utilizing the `makeAPICall` function to fetch the logo from a URL sourced from `merchant_details.logo` (initially) then  `merchant_details.config.logo`. The `getBase64` function was commented out, indicating a shift towards fetching the logo via API.  Minor updates include correcting a console log message ("API Reso" to "API Response").


Finally (12:02:03), the API endpoint for logo retrieval was changed to use `APIEndPoints.downlaodLogo` from a newly introduced  `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` file.  The API call now includes a `payload` with `type` and `path` properties.  This suggests a more structured API interaction.  The `apiEndpoints.ts` file defines various API endpoints for different functionalities within the dashboard application.  There are many endpoints related to orders, pincodes, refunds, discounts, and merchant configurations, highlighting a comprehensive API structure.

Throughout the revisions, the core UI elements (Form, ColorPicker, Upload component) remained largely unchanged, indicating a focus on backend integration for logo handling.

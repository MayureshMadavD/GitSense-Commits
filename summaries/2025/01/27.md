# Activity Summary for 27/01/2025

## 11:04:07
The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file, updated on 27/01/2025 at 10:09:34, is an API route handling email sending for daily and weekly reports.  The key functionality revolves around scheduled tasks using `node-cron`.

**Key Changes/Features:**

* **POST Request:**  Accepts image data, header name, and report ID (1 for daily, 2 for weekly) to save report data.  It uses the `pngReportData` function from the backend.

* **Scheduled Tasks:** Uses `node-cron` to schedule:
    * A daily report task running at 1:30 AM UTC (Asia/Kolkata timezone). This fetches daily reports, filters for non-'NA' entries, and sends an email using the `sendEmailForReport` function.  If sending is successful, it deletes the report data using `deletepngReportData`.
    * A (commented-out) weekly report task running at 1:00 AM UTC on Mondays.  The logic is similar to the daily task, but uses `getPreviousDate` and filters for weekly reports.

* **Email Sending:** The `sendEmailForReport` function uses `nodemailer` to send emails.  The email contains an embedded image from the base64 encoded `imageData`. It retrieves email credentials from environment variables (not shown due to security concerns).

* **Data Handling:** Functions `getPngReportByTodayDate` and `deletepngReportData` interact with a database (presumably) to manage report data.  `getCurrentDate` and `getPreviousDate` handle date retrieval.

* **GET Request:** A GET request triggers the `dailyReportTriggerTime` function, which sets up the cron job for daily reports and returns the current date and time.

In essence, this code implements a system for automatically generating and emailing daily and weekly reports based on data stored in a backend database.  The commented-out weekly report task suggests it might be under development or temporarily disabled.  The significant timestamp is 27/01/2025, 10:09:34, reflecting the last update to this file.


## 12:04:07
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` between 11:13:29 and 12:02:03 on January 27, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes is the implementation of logo retrieval and display within a brand customization form.

Initially (11:13:29), the component directly used `merchant_details` from Redux to populate brand data, including the logo.  The logo was displayed using a local `getBase64` function.


Subsequent revisions (11:53:07, 11:55:09, 11:56:45, 11:56:52) introduced an `async` function `getCurrentLogo`, utilizing the `makeAPICall` function to fetch the logo from a URL sourced from `merchant_details.logo` (initially) then  `merchant_details.config.logo`. The `getBase64` function was commented out, indicating a shift towards fetching the logo via API.  Minor updates include correcting a console log message ("API Reso" to "API Response").


Finally (12:02:03), the API endpoint for logo retrieval was changed to use `APIEndPoints.downlaodLogo` from a newly introduced  `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` file.  The API call now includes a `payload` with `type` and `path` properties.  This suggests a more structured API interaction.  The `apiEndpoints.ts` file defines various API endpoints for different functionalities within the dashboard application.  There are many endpoints related to orders, pincodes, refunds, discounts, and merchant configurations, highlighting a comprehensive API structure.

Throughout the revisions, the core UI elements (Form, ColorPicker, Upload component) remained largely unchanged, indicating a focus on backend integration for logo handling.


## 13:04:13
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` between 12:05 PM and 1:03 PM on January 27, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the implementation of a logo retrieval and display feature within a brand customization form.

Initially, the code included commented-out sections attempting to fetch a logo using an API call (`getCurrentLogo`).  Between 12:06 PM and 12:08 PM,  several iterations refined the logo fetching logic, ultimately settling on `isLogoPresentForCurrentMerchant`, which makes a POST request to an endpoint derived from  `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL + APIEndPoints.downlaodLogo`.  The payload contains the logo path.  Further refinements, between 12:19 PM and 12:51 PM, focused on correctly parsing the API response to extract the download URL.  The response structure appears nested (`response?.data?.data?.download_url`).

The changes between 12:51 PM and 12:57 PM involved switching from setting the `imgUrl` state variable directly to updating the `brandData` state with the retrieved logo URL.  This ensures that the logo is correctly reflected in the form and passed to the `onChange` handler. Finally, around 13:00 PM the `imgUrl` state variable was removed entirely, and the logo image was correctly rendered using the `brandData.logo` value.  The commented-out `getBase64` function suggests an earlier attempt to handle logo uploads using base64 encoding, which was later replaced. The final change at 13:03 PM removed the `onFinish` function from setting the `logo` value in the form, since the change was already being handled in the `useEffect` hook

Throughout the log, there are numerous `console.log` statements used for debugging. These statements were gradually refined or removed as the developer progressed, indicating iterative development and testing.  The `validateUpload` function, which checks file type and size, remains consistent throughout.  The final version of the code uses `useEffect` to fetch and update the logo upon changes in `merchant_details`, providing a more efficient and reactive approach. The logo image size was also adjusted multiple times in the final versions.


## 14:04:12
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` between 13:05:31 and 13:44:13 on January 27, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes centers around integrating a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook. This hook, initially added around 13:10:24,  provides `config`, `loading`, `refetch`, and `saveConfig` functionalities.  Several subsequent commits adjust how the `config` object is used and logged, primarily to access and display the `custom_config.cssRules.primaryColor` for setting the background color (`bgcolor`) in the `brandData` state.  There's also an attempt to use `config.custom_config.cssRules.textColor` for `textcolor` but it's ultimately removed in later commits.


Initially, the component fetched logo URLs from `merchant_details.logo` (13:05:31) and now uses the `useMerchantConfigApi` hook for fetching background and text colors (13:10:24 onwards).  There was experimentation with different ways to access and use the config data within the `useEffect` hook, leading to several commits with minor changes in logging statements and data access between 13:10:53 and 13:27:23.  Around 13:26:23 the `configSaveUrl` within `useMerchantConfigApi` was updated from `APIEndPoints.updateDiscountConfig` to `APIEndPoints.shopifyMerchantConfigs`. Finally, at 13:27:23, `initialValues` are added to the Form, pre-populating form fields with data from `brandData`.  A `console.log(file)` statement was added to `handleUpload` at 13:44:13, likely for debugging purposes.  The commented-out code related to `getBase64` and setting `imageUrl` suggests an earlier approach to logo handling that was replaced by a more streamlined method.  Throughout the edits, the file structure remains largely consistent, focusing mainly on integrating and refining the `useMerchantConfigApi` hook for data fetching and state updates.


## 16:04:09
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx` on January 27, 2025.

The `brand.tsx` file underwent several minor modifications between 15:58:55 and 16:02:46.  The primary changes involved adjustments to the `initialValues` prop within the `<Form>` component.  Specifically, the initial values for `'primary-color'` and `'text-color'` were initially derived from the `brandData` state. Later revisions directly assigned these values within the `initialValues` object, simplifying the code.  Another change involved removing a `console.log` statement and correcting the `initialValues` object's structure to ensure proper formatting. Finally, the `defaultValues` prop in the nested `ColorPicketComponent` was updated to utilize `brandData.bgcolor` and `brandData.textcolor` instead of hardcoded values.


The `colorpicker.tsx` file was modified twice, at 16:03:21 and 16:03:43.  These changes were minor: a `console.log` statement was added to print the `defaultValues` prop, and a slight modification was made to the message within the `console.log`.  These modifications do not affect the core functionality of the component.  The added `console.log` suggests debugging efforts.

In summary, the majority of the changes focused on refining the `brand.tsx` component's initial state and data flow, particularly how color values are handled and passed to the `ColorPicketComponent`.  The modifications to `colorpicker.tsx` seem purely for debugging purposes.  All the changes were made within a short timeframe, suggesting a focused development or debugging session.


## 17:04:10
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx`:**  This component, `ColorPicketComponent`,  underwent several revisions between 16:05:27 and 16:13:58 on January 27, 2025. The initial version included `useEffect` to handle default color values. Subsequent changes removed the `useEffect` hook (at 16:07:15), added a `console.log` statement (at 16:07:52), and finally settled on a simpler version without the `useEffect` hook (at 16:13:58).  The core functionality of rendering two `ColorPicker` components remained consistent throughout.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx`:** This component, `BrandForm`, was updated multiple times between 16:08:29 and 16:59:50 on January 27, 2025.  The main changes focused on the Form's `initialValues` prop. Initially, it lacked `initialValues` (at 16:08:29).  Several attempts to set `initialValues` followed:  at 16:09:35 it was set to `{'primary-color': "#123456", 'text-color': "#234567"}`, then to  `{'primary-color': "", 'text-color': ""}` (at 16:09:59), then to `{'primary-color': brandData?.bgcolor, 'text-color': ""}` (at 16:10:37). Finally, at 16:11:05 and onwards, the  `initialValues` were removed again. Another significant change (16:48:28) involved uncommenting and using the `getBase64` function, enabling logo uploads and base64 encoding.  A further minor change at 16:59:39 and 16:59:50 added more `console.log` statements for debugging purposes within the `validateUpload` function. The core structure of the form, including logo upload and color picker functionality, remained mostly unchanged across these revisions.


In summary, the updates to `colorpicker.tsx` involved streamlining the component by removing unnecessary state management.  The `brand.tsx` updates centered around iterative adjustments to the form's initial values, along with adding image upload functionality and debugging log statements.  The frequent changes to `brand.tsx` suggest ongoing development and testing, likely involving adjustments to state management and data handling related to the form's initial values.


## 19:04:11
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` file between 18:09:29 and 19:02:46 on January 27, 2025.  The primary focus of these revisions centers around the `BrandForm` component, which handles brand customization, including logo uploads and theme color selection.

Initially, the component fetched the logo from the server using a POST request to `/api/dashboard/utility/download`.  Later revisions introduced a new `fetchUploadedLogoURL` function that uses a POST request to `/api/dashboard/utility/presigned-url` to obtain a pre-signed URL for logo uploads. This change significantly improved the upload process.  The `customRequest` prop in the `Upload` component was added and then removed in different revisions, likely as part of experimentation with the upload flow.  The `handleUpload` function also shows some minor changes in log statements.

There was a period of modifications between 18:11:09 and 18:13:55 where the  `customRequest`  function was added to and then removed from the  `uploadProps`  object.  This suggests testing different methods for handling custom upload requests.  Furthermore, additional logging statements were added to `isLogoPresentForCurrentMerchant` and `handleUpload` to debug the upload functionality. A final modification at 18:53:11 simplified the return value of `isLogoPresentForCurrentMerchant` to handle cases where `logoURL` might be null or undefined, making it more robust.  The final changes around 19:02:46 focused on calling `fetchUploadedLogoURL` within `handleUpload` upon successful file upload to fetch the presigned URL and then process the upload.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` file was updated at 18:19:34, adding several new API endpoints related to various dashboard functionalities like order management, pincode management, refund processing, and merchant configuration.  This update doesn't directly impact the `BrandForm` component but provides the necessary backend endpoints the component interacts with.  The addition of  `/api/dashboard/utility/presigned-url`  is particularly relevant to the changes in `brand.tsx`.


## 20:04:06
The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` file was updated on 27/01/2025 at 19:08:46.  This React component (`BrandForm`) allows users to customize brand settings, including logo upload and color selection.

The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components for UI elements like `Button`, `Upload`, `ColorPicker`, etc.  It interacts with a backend API (`makeAPICall`) to upload logos and fetch existing brand configurations.  The logo upload functionality includes validation for file type and size.  Uploaded logos are converted to base64 for display.  The component fetches and displays the merchant's logo and theme colors. The  `useMerchantConfigApi` hook manages fetching and saving configuration data.  A help guide link is included.  The color picker uses a custom component (`ColorPicketComponent`). The form's data is managed using React's `useState` and `useSelector` hooks.  The component also handles the display of a preview of the uploaded logo using a placeholder image if no logo is present.  The `onChange` prop allows for communication with parent components.


## 21:04:07
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` file between 20:26:28 and 20:58:10 on January 27, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `fetchUploadedLogoURL` function and the `handleUpload` function within a React component responsible for brand customization.

Initially, the `fetchUploadedLogoURL` function lacked a timestamp in its log statement and the  `handleUpload` function used a `console.log` statement after the `getBase64` call.  Subsequent revisions added a timestamp to the log statement in `fetchUploadedLogoURL` at 20:48:29, and then added `console.log(Obj)` at 20:49:42 for debugging purposes.  These were then removed in the next few revisions (20:51:41, 20:51:47, 20:51:54).

A significant change occurred around 20:54:41, where the `handleUpload` function was updated to include a `PUT` request using the `fetch` API after successfully obtaining the pre-signed URL. This suggests a change in the logo upload mechanism, likely to directly upload the file to the server using the pre-signed URL instead of relying solely on the backend to handle the upload.  The unnecessary `console.log` statements in the `fetchUploadedLogoURL` function were also removed during this period.  The final version at 20:58:10 remained consistent with the previous revision.

The rest of the component remains largely unchanged throughout the revisions. It uses React hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useSelector`),  `gokwik-ui-kit` components, and custom components/functions for handling logo uploads, color selection, and API calls to fetch and save brand configuration data.  The code consistently handles logo uploads, validating file types and sizes, and fetching the logo URL from the merchant details. The `isLogoPresentForCurrentMerchant` function is used to retrieve existing logos.  There is a clear pattern of using `makeAPICall` for all API interactions.

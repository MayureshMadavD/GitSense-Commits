# Activity Summary for 30/01/2025

## 15:05:16
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`  and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/payments.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/address.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` between January 29th, 2025, 21:08:00 and January 30th, 2025, 11:56:53.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent numerous revisions within a short time frame (21:08 to 22:56).  These changes appear to be focused on refining a React component responsible for editing orders.  The code suggests a table displaying order line items with features for adding, deleting, and modifying quantities, and handling discounts.  There are also functions for re-adding recently deleted items and managing discount application.  No significant structural changes are evident; most changes seem iterative, possibly bug fixes or minor UI improvements.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/brand.tsx` file was modified between 11:22 and 11:39.  This file is a React component for customizing brand settings within the checkout dashboard. The main updates involved refining the logo upload functionality (validation, base64 conversion, API calls), improving error handling, and incorporating a `ColorPicketComponent` for theme customization. The changes suggest a focus on improving user experience and ensuring seamless integration with backend APIs.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/colorpicker.tsx` file shows several small, quick edits (11:16 to 11:35).  The component initially used state variables to handle default color values. This was later changed to directly use Form.useForm() to handle the default values for improved integration with the larger form structure.  The final version removed unnecessary state management, simplifying the component.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` file was updated at 12:52. This component renders the main settings page, dynamically generating menu items based on the user's role and configuration. A significant change was incorporating the Customize UI section into the settings list, regardless of DIY mode. The `openItems` logic was also improved to better handle navigation and maintain the previously opened menu item state.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx`, `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/payments.tsx`, and  `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/address.tsx` files were modified to improve UI elements for customizing the login, payment, and address sections of the checkout experience, respectively. The changes in these files involve updating state management, improving form handling, and enhancing the user interface.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` file shows a modification made at 12:57. This component, a rich text editor, was updated to improve its functionality. Notably, the changes focus on improving the handling of text formatting and URL linking, as well as state management.  The count of characters also is now shown in the UI.


## 16:04:58
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file, updated on 30/01/2025 at 15:31:13, is a TypeScript service responsible for managing environment-specific URLs and configurations.  It defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestions, main API, Cred, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, and analytics), CDN paths, and merchant URLs based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.). The code extensively uses conditional statements to switch between different URLs for each environment.  A notable aspect is the handling of the `local` environment, which often uses different local URLs for testing.  The file also includes functions to set and retrieve cookies related to the landing page and referrer. The `setCart` function initializes a cart object with sample data.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file, updated at 15:31:24 on the same day, is an HTML file that acts as a merchant integration point.  It includes a button triggering a checkout process. JavaScript code within the file manages merchant information (`merchantInfo` object) which includes various merchant IDs (likely specific to different environments or testing scenarios), environment settings (`environment`, `cashToPrepaid`), and other parameters. The Javascript also initializes a gokwikSdk which loads a script (potentially the main checkout script) and handles communication with other parts of the application via postMessage. Cookie management is also included to track landing pages and referrers.  The `merchantInfo` object contains numerous merchant IDs, suggesting a possible testing framework or support for multiple clients.  The commented-out script tags indicate potential future additions to this page.


## 17:04:58
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` on January 30th, 2025, between 16:58:29 and 17:01:38.  The file defines functions that return URLs based on the current environment (`env`).  These functions handle various API endpoints (health, address suggestions, core API, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, analytics), CDN paths, and merchant URLs.  The `env` variable is subscribed to changes in the `store_environment` from `LoginStore`.  When `env` is 'local', a `setCart` function is called, which appears to populate a cart object in the `store_cartjsObject` with product details.

The most significant change between revisions is a minor formatting update in the `setCart` function's  `store_cartjsObject.set()` call at around 17:01:38; the object properties are changed from using quotes around keys to using no quotes in the latest revision. The core functionality and URLs remain consistent across all revisions.  The code extensively uses conditional logic based on the `env` variable to switch between different API endpoints and URLs for development (`dev`, `hdev`, `ndev`, `idev`), testing (`qa`, `qa-rto`, `qaone`, `qatwo`), sandbox, and production environments.  There's also a `pci-prod` environment specifically mentioned.  The `setCart` function is only called in the `local` environment.  Functions `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` return different tokens depending on the environment.


## 18:04:58
The log shows two entries for `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, both occurring on January 30, 2025, within a minute of each other (17:06:24 and 17:06:31).  The changes are minor, only affecting the formatting of the `setCart` function's argument; specifically the JSON structure representing cart items has improved formatting, with better spacing and line breaks in the second entry. The file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestions, API, Cred, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, etc.) based on the current environment (`env`).  It also defines functions to get CDN paths, analytics API URLs (v1 and v2), merchant URLs, and tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`), all dependent on the `env` variable. The `env` variable is dynamically determined, seemingly pulling from a LoginStore.  The code extensively handles various environment values, including 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and several other variations like 'qa-rto', 'qaone', 'qatwo', 'hdev', 'ndev', 'idev', and 'pci-prod'.  The `setCart` function populates a cart object with specific item details.  No functional changes are observed between the two log entries.

# Activity Summary for 29/01/2025

## 13:04:05
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` was updated on 29/01/2025 at 12:48:58.  This React component (`Login`) allows customization of the login section UI.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` and other custom components for UI elements like forms, rich text editors, and color pickers.

Key updates include:

* **Form Handling:** The component utilizes a Form component from `gokwik-ui-kit` to manage form data.  Changes are handled using `onChange` and `onValuesChange` events, updating both `loginData` and `visibility` states.  `handleFormSubmit` saves the configuration using `saveConfig` from `useMerchantConfigApi`.

* **State Management:**  `useState` is used extensively to manage form values (`loginData`), visibility of UI sections (`visibility`), and loading state from `useMerchantConfigApi`.

* **Conditional Rendering:** The visibility of different sections (banner, consent text, input field) is controlled by the `visibility` state and rendered conditionally using a `Switch` component.

* **Rich Text Editor and Color Picker Integration:** Custom components (`RichTextEditor` and `ColorPicketComponent`) are integrated to allow users to customize text content and colors.

* **Data Persistence:**  `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is used to fetch and save the configuration, likely persisting changes to a server.  The `useEffect` hooks handle data synchronization between the component's state and the server configuration.

* **Helper Function:** The `renderFormItem` function simplifies the rendering of form items, promoting code reusability.

The code is well-structured and uses functional components and hooks, leveraging `gokwik-ui-kit` for a consistent UI experience.  The use of `useEffect` hooks ensures data synchronization and efficient state management. The component allows users to customize banner content, primary button text, and consent text, with options to toggle visibility.  A color picker allows customization of background and text colors for the login section.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` files on January 29, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/.env` file contains environment variables for different environments (dev, qa, sandbox) and is not summarized further.

The `index.ejs` file underwent several revisions.  The core structure of the HTML remained consistent, primarily involving changes to the `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` section. This section dynamically loads different JavaScript modules based on the `deployedEnv` variable (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  Each environment points to different URLs for various @gokwik modules (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, etc.). The production environment includes additional scripts for Clarity and New Relic.  These changes, all occurring within a short time frame (13:15:35, 13:18:53, 13:25:38, 13:25:45), suggest a deployment process for different environments.


The `index.tsx` file (13:32:11) is a React component for displaying order details. It fetches order data using `makeAPICall`, handles refund logic (including merging repeated refunds), displays order information and price breakdowns. The code uses React hooks (`useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`) and Redux selectors (`useSelector`).  It also integrates with `react-router-dom` for navigation and `single-spa` for navigation across microservices.  The significant update at 13:32:11 likely reflects an enhancement or bug fix related to order details display and refund functionality.  The component's logic is extensive and deals with various order statuses, price breakdowns (discounts, taxes, shipping), and user permissions.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent several revisions on January 29, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be enhancements to the discount functionality and the handling of line items within an order editing interface.

Initially, the code included state management for line items, a modal for deleting items, and basic discount functionality (discount type, value, title).  Between 14:22:34 and 14:25:33, minor edits were made, possibly for code style or minor bug fixes; the core functionality remained largely the same.  No substantial changes are evident in these commits.

A significant change occurred at 14:59:08.  The component's state now includes an `orderData` variable of type `OrderData`, suggesting an integration to fetch and manage more comprehensive order details. The `useMemo` hook was added to the imports, indicating potential performance optimizations.  Additionally, `InfoCircleOutlined` was added to the imports from `gokwik-ui-kit`, hinting at potential UI improvements related to providing information to the user.

Further minor refinements were made between 15:00:19 and 15:03:48, primarily involving type annotations and potentially addressing minor issues, with no significant functional alterations detected.

Throughout all revisions, the core structure of the component remained constant, managing line items with add, delete, and quantity modification functionality, along with discount application and removal.  The use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components points towards a consistent UI framework.  The repeated use of `variant_id` for tracking products suggests a system using product variants.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions on January 29, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes appears to be the enhancement of the discount functionality and UI components within an order editing feature.

Early revisions (15:04:41, 15:07:49, 15:08:12) show the initial implementation and minor refinements of the component's structure.  No significant functional changes are evident during this period, mainly involving code formatting and minor additions to the import statements (addition of `Divider` at 15:08:37).

Later updates (15:08:49 - 15:20:22) show no visible changes in the code.

A notable change occurred at 15:25:11, where the code remained largely unchanged but a significant time gap suggests a possible merge or larger-scale integration of features. Another notable change happened at 15:27:07 and 15:27:57 which also involved minor code changes and are very close to each other in timestamp.

The final revisions (15:46:35, 15:47:23)  added an `Alert` component from the `gokwik-ui-kit`. This suggests the addition of error handling or informational messages within the UI.

Throughout the log, the code consistently deals with managing order line items, applying discounts (both fixed amount and percentage-based), and handling the deletion and re-addition of items. The use of `react-redux` and `gokwik-ui-kit` indicates the use of Redux state management and a custom UI component library. The consistent use of `variant_id` suggests a system where products have variants (e.g., different sizes or colors).

# Activity Summary for 29/01/2025

## 13:04:05
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` was updated on 29/01/2025 at 12:48:58.  This React component (`Login`) allows customization of the login section UI.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` and other custom components for UI elements like forms, rich text editors, and color pickers.

Key updates include:

* **Form Handling:** The component utilizes a Form component from `gokwik-ui-kit` to manage form data.  Changes are handled using `onChange` and `onValuesChange` events, updating both `loginData` and `visibility` states.  `handleFormSubmit` saves the configuration using `saveConfig` from `useMerchantConfigApi`.

* **State Management:**  `useState` is used extensively to manage form values (`loginData`), visibility of UI sections (`visibility`), and loading state from `useMerchantConfigApi`.

* **Conditional Rendering:** The visibility of different sections (banner, consent text, input field) is controlled by the `visibility` state and rendered conditionally using a `Switch` component.

* **Rich Text Editor and Color Picker Integration:** Custom components (`RichTextEditor` and `ColorPicketComponent`) are integrated to allow users to customize text content and colors.

* **Data Persistence:**  `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is used to fetch and save the configuration, likely persisting changes to a server.  The `useEffect` hooks handle data synchronization between the component's state and the server configuration.

* **Helper Function:** The `renderFormItem` function simplifies the rendering of form items, promoting code reusability.

The code is well-structured and uses functional components and hooks, leveraging `gokwik-ui-kit` for a consistent UI experience.  The use of `useEffect` hooks ensures data synchronization and efficient state management. The component allows users to customize banner content, primary button text, and consent text, with options to toggle visibility.  A color picker allows customization of background and text colors for the login section.

# Activity Summary for 29/01/2025

## 13:04:05
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` was updated on 29/01/2025 at 12:48:58.  This React component (`Login`) allows customization of the login section UI.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` and other custom components for UI elements like forms, rich text editors, and color pickers.

Key updates include:

* **Form Handling:** The component utilizes a Form component from `gokwik-ui-kit` to manage form data.  Changes are handled using `onChange` and `onValuesChange` events, updating both `loginData` and `visibility` states.  `handleFormSubmit` saves the configuration using `saveConfig` from `useMerchantConfigApi`.

* **State Management:**  `useState` is used extensively to manage form values (`loginData`), visibility of UI sections (`visibility`), and loading state from `useMerchantConfigApi`.

* **Conditional Rendering:** The visibility of different sections (banner, consent text, input field) is controlled by the `visibility` state and rendered conditionally using a `Switch` component.

* **Rich Text Editor and Color Picker Integration:** Custom components (`RichTextEditor` and `ColorPicketComponent`) are integrated to allow users to customize text content and colors.

* **Data Persistence:**  `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is used to fetch and save the configuration, likely persisting changes to a server.  The `useEffect` hooks handle data synchronization between the component's state and the server configuration.

* **Helper Function:** The `renderFormItem` function simplifies the rendering of form items, promoting code reusability.

The code is well-structured and uses functional components and hooks, leveraging `gokwik-ui-kit` for a consistent UI experience.  The use of `useEffect` hooks ensures data synchronization and efficient state management. The component allows users to customize banner content, primary button text, and consent text, with options to toggle visibility.  A color picker allows customization of background and text colors for the login section.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` and `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` files on January 29, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/.env` file contains environment variables for different environments (dev, qa, sandbox) and is not summarized further.

The `index.ejs` file underwent several revisions.  The core structure of the HTML remained consistent, primarily involving changes to the `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` section. This section dynamically loads different JavaScript modules based on the `deployedEnv` variable (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  Each environment points to different URLs for various @gokwik modules (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, etc.). The production environment includes additional scripts for Clarity and New Relic.  These changes, all occurring within a short time frame (13:15:35, 13:18:53, 13:25:38, 13:25:45), suggest a deployment process for different environments.


The `index.tsx` file (13:32:11) is a React component for displaying order details. It fetches order data using `makeAPICall`, handles refund logic (including merging repeated refunds), displays order information and price breakdowns. The code uses React hooks (`useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`) and Redux selectors (`useSelector`).  It also integrates with `react-router-dom` for navigation and `single-spa` for navigation across microservices.  The significant update at 13:32:11 likely reflects an enhancement or bug fix related to order details display and refund functionality.  The component's logic is extensive and deals with various order statuses, price breakdowns (discounts, taxes, shipping), and user permissions.

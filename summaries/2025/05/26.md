# Activity Summary for 26/05/2025

## 10:56:55
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` on May 26th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the refinement of a React component (`ShippingMethodConfig`) responsible for configuring shipping methods.

The first few revisions (10:44:15, 10:44:49, 10:45:36, 10:47:09, 10:47:52) involve iterative adjustments to the component's form structure. These adjustments primarily center around the handling of conditional fields related to "dynamic COD fees."  Specifically, fields like `total_amount` and `cod_charges` are made conditionally visible (`hidden: !isSwitchEnabled?.code_fee`) based on a switch control (`isSwitchEnabled.code_fee`).  There's also consistent work on input validation and error handling within the form, particularly for pincode input.  An `useEffect` hook fetching customer segments is initially present and later removed, suggesting a refactoring of data fetching.

The final revision (10:53:20) represents a more substantial change.  It introduces the use of `useSelector` from `react-redux` to access merchant details and incorporates an `async` function `fetchPincodeList`, which makes an API call to retrieve pincode data using the merchant's ID and other parameters from the environment variable `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL`.  The `fileImageSvg` import path is also updated. This suggests a shift towards integrating the component with a backend system for data retrieval.  The consistent use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and internal utility functions indicates adherence to a specific design system and internal helper functions throughout the entire development process.


## 13:56:58
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` on May 26, 2025.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` Updates:**

This file contains various helper functions.  The most significant changes are within the `uploadCohortCsv` function. Initially, it allowed for CSV files containing a mix of phone numbers and emails.  Later revisions introduced error handling to prevent uploads with mixed data types, requiring either only phone numbers or only emails.  These changes occurred between 13:49:47 and 13:55:18.  No other functional changes are observed in the helper file.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` Updates:**

This React component handles shipping method configuration.  The major changes revolve around how `merchant_id` is accessed and used within the `requestForShippingModule` function. Initially, there were attempts to access this id in different ways using `useSelector`. Finally, the correct method `useSelector(getMerchantDetails).m_id` was used in the final commit at 13:44:54.  The initial attempts to get the merchant ID are logged to the console.  The `requestForShippingModule` function uploads CSV data to a URL obtained through an API call. The function handles file upload and error scenarios.  This file also demonstrates handling CSV uploads for pincodes, validating the format, and updating the form state accordingly. This remains consistent across all revisions.


## 14:56:52
The log shows code changes on May 26, 2025, primarily focused on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, likely for a single-page application dashboard.

The significant changes involve modifying the `systemjs-importmap` script tag within `index.ejs`.  This script defines the location of various modules (`@gokwik/*`) based on the environment (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).  In each environment, different URLs are used to load the Gokwik modules (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, etc.). The `production` environment also includes code snippets for Clarity (analytics) and New Relic (monitoring).  The inclusion of these tools suggests a shift towards production deployment. The local environment uses `localhost` URLs for some modules, indicative of local development.  The change likely reflects a refactoring or update to the dashboard's module loading system to handle different deployment environments. The timestamps show that these changes happened within a short timeframe (seconds apart), suggesting a coordinated update.  There is a clear pattern of conditional logic based on `deployedEnv` variable to select appropriate module URLs.


## 16:56:52
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/index.tsx` file between 16:24:04 and 16:26:54 on May 26, 2025.  The changes appear to be minor edits and do not significantly alter the core functionality.  All revisions contain the same imports and overall structure.  The timestamps suggest rapid iterative development or debugging. There are no discernible patterns in the code changes beyond minor formatting adjustments within the code snippets provided.

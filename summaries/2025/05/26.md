# Activity Summary for 26/05/2025

## 10:56:55
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` on May 26th, 2025.  The primary focus of the changes is the refinement of a React component (`ShippingMethodConfig`) responsible for configuring shipping methods.

The first few revisions (10:44:15, 10:44:49, 10:45:36, 10:47:09, 10:47:52) involve iterative adjustments to the component's form structure. These adjustments primarily center around the handling of conditional fields related to "dynamic COD fees."  Specifically, fields like `total_amount` and `cod_charges` are made conditionally visible (`hidden: !isSwitchEnabled?.code_fee`) based on a switch control (`isSwitchEnabled.code_fee`).  There's also consistent work on input validation and error handling within the form, particularly for pincode input.  An `useEffect` hook fetching customer segments is initially present and later removed, suggesting a refactoring of data fetching.

The final revision (10:53:20) represents a more substantial change.  It introduces the use of `useSelector` from `react-redux` to access merchant details and incorporates an `async` function `fetchPincodeList`, which makes an API call to retrieve pincode data using the merchant's ID and other parameters from the environment variable `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL`.  The `fileImageSvg` import path is also updated. This suggests a shift towards integrating the component with a backend system for data retrieval.  The consistent use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and internal utility functions indicates adherence to a specific design system and internal helper functions throughout the entire development process.

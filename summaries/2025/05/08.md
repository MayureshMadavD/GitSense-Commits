The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` between 07/05/2025 and 08/05/2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the `createOptionsListForFilter` function and using it to dynamically populate filters for the Ant Design `Table` component.

The initial commit (07/05/2025, 23:59:37)  established a React component displaying merchant data in a table with various filtering and sorting capabilities.  The `createOptionsListForFilter` function was initially less efficient.

Subsequent commits (08/05/2025, between 00:00:57 and 00:31:24) progressively improved the `createOptionsListForFilter` function.  The most significant changes involved:

* **Improved Uniqueness Handling:** The method for generating unique filter options changed from using `Array.from(new Set(...))` to leveraging `Set` directly for better efficiency.
* **Empty String Handling:** The `uniqueOptions` Set was updated to filter out empty strings to avoid erroneous filter entries.
* **Simplified Logic:**  Redundant code blocks within `createOptionsListForFilter` were removed.
* **Dynamic Filter Population:** The `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` was modified to utilize the `createOptionsListForFilter` function to dynamically generate filter options for "CE Name" and "Platform" columns based on the `merchantData` prop.  This makes the filters context-aware and data-driven.

The final commit (08/05/2025, 00:31:24) represents a stable version with the optimized `createOptionsListForFilter`.  There were also minor corrections in the `rowKey` prop of the Ant Design Table component (using `row.id`) and fixing some key issues. The `key` prop in the `Recently Comments` section was also corrected.  All commits modified the same file.  The majority of changes occurred within a short period (around 30 minutes) on 08/05/2025, indicating an iterative debugging and refinement process.

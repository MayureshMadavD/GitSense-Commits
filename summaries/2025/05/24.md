# Activity Summary for 24/05/2025

## 10:21:57
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx`.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying shipping settings.  The code remains largely consistent across all revisions, rendering a shipping service component or a "No Shipping Available" message depending on the `shippingOptionList` from the `merchantConfig` API.

The main changes were minor:

* **23/05/2025, 23:55:23:** Initial commit.  The component fetches shipping options, updates breadcrumbs, and conditionally renders a shipping service or an error message.  A `console.log` statement is present.

* **23/05/2025, 23:57:37:** A very minor change was made. The only difference between this version and the previous one is that the `console.log` statement has been moved inside the `useEffect` hook.

* **24/05/2025, 00:11:16:** The `console.log` statement was removed from the previous version.  This is likely a final version.

The code consistently uses hooks from `@library/utilities` and `@gokwik/utilities`, indicating a reliance on a shared utility library and a UI toolkit (`gokwik-ui-kit`).  The component interacts with a merchant configuration API (`APIEndPoints?.merchantConfigs`) to fetch shipping prices. No significant functional changes are observed between the versions; the edits seem focused on minor adjustments to the code structure and logging.

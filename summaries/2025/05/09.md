# Activity Summary for 09/05/2025

## 09:56:47
The provided log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` between 23:23:16 and 23:48:05 on August 5, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor edits or refinements, as the core structure and functionality of the React component remain consistent across all revisions. No substantial changes to the code's logic are observed.  The component uses Ant Design components for its UI, and interacts with backend functions (`createNewMerchant`, `deletEntryForMerchant`, `updateMerchantByID`) for merchant data management. The `formFeilds` array defines a comprehensive form for merchant details, including various input types and validation rules. The `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` array configures columns for a merchant data table, enabling filtering and sorting.  The code includes functions for handling merchant deletion via confirmations and error handling for backend API calls.  There's no discernible pattern beyond iterative refinements of the code.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/backend/query.js` file was also updated between 23:40:24 and 23:41:37, with these changes likely related to user and merchant data management on the backend,  but the exact changes within the file are not included in the provided log's excerpt.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx`, a React component for displaying and managing merchant data.  The primary changes revolve around the `formFeilds` array, which defines the fields in a merchant data form.

Between 14:32:29 and 14:39:21, several modifications were made.  Initially, the `merchanttype` field's options were dynamically generated using `createOptionsListForFilter`.  This was later replaced (at 14:39:01 and 14:39:21) with a hardcoded array of options: `[{ label: "New", value: "new" }, { label: "Re-live", value: "relive" }, { label: "Migration", value: "migration" }]`.  This suggests a shift from dynamic option population to a predefined set of merchant types.  Additionally, the `golivecommit` select options' `text` property was changed to `label` at 14:39:21, improving consistency.  The `showDeleteConfirm` function remained unchanged, suggesting stability in the deletion functionality.  The other updates were minor, such as correcting typos (`formFieds` to `formFeilds`) and adjusting the labeling of options within select fields.  No significant structural changes were observed in the component's overall architecture.

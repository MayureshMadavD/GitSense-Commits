# Activity Summary for 09/05/2025

## 09:56:47
The provided log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` between 23:23:16 and 23:48:05 on August 5, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor edits or refinements, as the core structure and functionality of the React component remain consistent across all revisions. No substantial changes to the code's logic are observed.  The component uses Ant Design components for its UI, and interacts with backend functions (`createNewMerchant`, `deletEntryForMerchant`, `updateMerchantByID`) for merchant data management. The `formFeilds` array defines a comprehensive form for merchant details, including various input types and validation rules. The `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` array configures columns for a merchant data table, enabling filtering and sorting.  The code includes functions for handling merchant deletion via confirmations and error handling for backend API calls.  There's no discernible pattern beyond iterative refinements of the code.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/backend/query.js` file was also updated between 23:40:24 and 23:41:37, with these changes likely related to user and merchant data management on the backend,  but the exact changes within the file are not included in the provided log's excerpt.


## 15:00:46
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx`, a React component for displaying and managing merchant data.  The primary changes revolve around the `formFeilds` array, which defines the fields in a merchant data form.

Between 14:32:29 and 14:39:21, several modifications were made.  Initially, the `merchanttype` field's options were dynamically generated using `createOptionsListForFilter`.  This was later replaced (at 14:39:01 and 14:39:21) with a hardcoded array of options: `[{ label: "New", value: "new" }, { label: "Re-live", value: "relive" }, { label: "Migration", value: "migration" }]`.  This suggests a shift from dynamic option population to a predefined set of merchant types.  Additionally, the `golivecommit` select options' `text` property was changed to `label` at 14:39:21, improving consistency.  The `showDeleteConfirm` function remained unchanged, suggesting stability in the deletion functionality.  The other updates were minor, such as correcting typos (`formFieds` to `formFeilds`) and adjusting the labeling of options within select fields.  No significant structural changes were observed in the component's overall architecture.


## 20:56:28
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx`, a React component likely responsible for displaying and managing merchant data.  The changes span from 20:42:20 to 20:55:24 on September 5th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, focusing on rendering a merchant table with filtering and editing capabilities.

The most significant change appears to be a minor update to the `showDeleteConfirm` function at 20:55:24, specifically correcting the `onCancel` function to include a set of curly braces `{}` indicating an empty function body, whereas previously it was missing them.  This is a small but important bug fix.

The code consistently uses Ant Design components (`Button`, `Table`, `Form`, `Select`, etc.) and date-fns for date formatting and manipulation.  The `formFeilds` array defines the structure and validation rules for merchant data input fields.  These fields cover various merchant attributes (name, CE name, ARR, kickoff date, etc.) and include conditional rendering based on user roles (`currentUser?.isAdmin` and `currentUser?.Profiledetails?.islead`).  The `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` array configures the columns displayed in the merchant table, enabling filtering based on numeric and date ranges, and text search on several columns.  No substantial structural changes are observed in the component's logic or data handling, only minor updates and corrections.


## 22:20:22
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` between 20:56:38 and 21:14:03 on 09/05/2025.  These updates appear to be minor edits, as the core code remains largely unchanged.  There are no discernible patterns in these repeated edits beyond the repeated saving of the file.


A single change was made to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/customize/customize.jsx` at 20:56:45 on 09/05/2025. This file appears to handle customization options, allowing for the addition and deletion of categories, platforms, checkout types, and merchant states.  The code uses Ant Design components and makes API calls (`additionalApiRequest`, `deleteAdditionalDetails`, `fetchAdditionalDetailRequest`) for data management.


Finally,  `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/dashboard.module.css` was updated at 21:19:17 on 09/05/2025. This commit modifies the styling of the dashboard, defining styles for containers, menus, content areas, and responsive design elements for screens with a maximum width of 768 pixels.

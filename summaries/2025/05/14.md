# Activity Summary for 14/05/2025

## 12:01:49
The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/dailyreport.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 23:10:42 and 23:33:10 on May 13, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: displaying daily reports with data categorized by merchant type (SMB/ENT and Emerging), status (Live/WIP), and various metrics like Expected ARR, platform, and checkout type.  The report includes tables summarizing this data and charts visualizing it.

The changes primarily focused on enhancing the user interface and report filtering:

* **23:10:42:** Initial version, showing data in multiple tables without any filtering mechanism.

* **23:16:24 - 23:18:54:**  A multi-select component (`antd`'s `Select`) was added to allow users to filter the visible sections of the report ("WIP SMB / ENT", "WIP EMERGING", "MQM Section", "Live SMB / ENT", "Live EMERGING", "Details For Chart").  Styling improvements were made using tailwind css classes like `flex`, `flex-row`, `justify-center`, `items-center`, `gap-4`, `p-5`, and `mb-5`  to improve layout and spacing. Minor adjustments were made to the placement and styling of the select component within the form.

* **23:26:27 - 23:27:33:** The `Select` component was integrated into an `antd` `Form` component. This enables managing the report section visibility using form state. The layout of the form was changed from `vertical` to `inline`.

* **23:32:15 - 23:33:10:** Conditional rendering was implemented based on the selected sections in the `Select` component. Now, only the selected report sections are displayed. This significantly improves the user experience by allowing customized views.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/chart/piechart.jsx` file was modified between 23:45:21 and 23:52:39 on May 13, 2025.  This file renders a pie chart showing the contribution of each Customer Engagement (CE) to the overall ARR.

* **23:45:21:**  The initial version utilized `recharts` to create the pie chart. The chart displayed "Expected ARR" by default, with a `Select` component allowing switching to "Booked ARR."


* **23:51:50 - 23:52:39:** The placement of the `Select` component and title was adjusted.  The `Row` and `Col` components from `antd` are used for layout.  The conditional rendering was implemented to only show the `Row` and `Col` elements when there is chart data to display.  This ensures a better user experience by not displaying the UI elements when there's no data to visualize.

The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`  on May 14th, 2025, between 14:16:07 and 14:33:27.  The file is a React component responsible for rendering a form, likely within a checkout dashboard.

The changes primarily involve modifications to the `loyaltyInputs` and `rewardInputs` arrays. These arrays define the structure and properties of form elements related to loyalty points and gift cards, respectively.  Each element within these arrays specifies the input type (switch, input, select, checkbox), its name (a nested array for accessing nested form data), label, optional status, span (likely for layout purposes), and other properties like tooltips, hidden status, and validation rules.

Significant changes include the addition of validation rules (`rules`) to several input fields within `loyaltyInputs` around 14:26:11 and 14:26:57,  specifically adding `required: true` messages to ensure that at least one option is selected in a select and checkbox field. Further modifications at 14:28:28 added `required: true` validation to an `inputNumber` field, specifying that it cannot be empty.  These changes improve the form's data integrity. There are also numerous minor edits and formatting changes throughout the series of commits.  The consistent use of `Tooltip` components for providing detailed explanations enhances the user experience.  The repeated use of  `custom_config` and `merchant_config` suggests a hierarchical structure for configuration settings.

The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts` file,  with two commits on May 14th, 2025.  Both commits modify the `cleverTapDiscountEvent` function. The first version (15:10:22) lacks a `console.log` statement, while the second (15:12:55) includes  `console.log(dataObj,"Final Success Push");` suggesting debugging or logging was added.  The function sends data to CleverTap regarding coupon application success or failure,  including coupon code, amount saved, original cart amount, checkout step, and UTM parameters.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file (15:08:26) defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs based on the environment ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.).  It extensively uses conditional logic to switch between different URLs for different environments.  The code also includes logic to set up a default cart object when the environment is 'local'.  A recurring pattern is the use of environment-specific URLs for different API endpoints (health, address suggestion, main API, etc.).

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file (15:09:32) is a merchant page that includes a button triggering a `goKwikCheckout` function. This function sends `merchantInfo` (containing merchant ID, environment, etc.) via a `window.postMessage` call. The page also contains cookie management for `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`, and client-side JavaScript logic that dynamically loads the Gokwik SDK script based on the environment (using `localhost:8080` for local development).  There is also commented-out code for analytics script inclusion.

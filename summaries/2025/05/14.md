# Activity Summary for 14/05/2025

## 12:01:49
The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/dailyreport.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 23:10:42 and 23:33:10 on May 13, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: displaying daily reports with data categorized by merchant type (SMB/ENT and Emerging), status (Live/WIP), and various metrics like Expected ARR, platform, and checkout type.  The report includes tables summarizing this data and charts visualizing it.

The changes primarily focused on enhancing the user interface and report filtering:

* **23:10:42:** Initial version, showing data in multiple tables without any filtering mechanism.

* **23:16:24 - 23:18:54:**  A multi-select component (`antd`'s `Select`) was added to allow users to filter the visible sections of the report ("WIP SMB / ENT", "WIP EMERGING", "MQM Section", "Live SMB / ENT", "Live EMERGING", "Details For Chart").  Styling improvements were made using tailwind css classes like `flex`, `flex-row`, `justify-center`, `items-center`, `gap-4`, `p-5`, and `mb-5`  to improve layout and spacing. Minor adjustments were made to the placement and styling of the select component within the form.

* **23:26:27 - 23:27:33:** The `Select` component was integrated into an `antd` `Form` component. This enables managing the report section visibility using form state. The layout of the form was changed from `vertical` to `inline`.

* **23:32:15 - 23:33:10:** Conditional rendering was implemented based on the selected sections in the `Select` component. Now, only the selected report sections are displayed. This significantly improves the user experience by allowing customized views.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/chart/piechart.jsx` file was modified between 23:45:21 and 23:52:39 on May 13, 2025.  This file renders a pie chart showing the contribution of each Customer Engagement (CE) to the overall ARR.

* **23:45:21:**  The initial version utilized `recharts` to create the pie chart. The chart displayed "Expected ARR" by default, with a `Select` component allowing switching to "Booked ARR."


* **23:51:50 - 23:52:39:** The placement of the `Select` component and title was adjusted.  The `Row` and `Col` components from `antd` are used for layout.  The conditional rendering was implemented to only show the `Row` and `Col` elements when there is chart data to display.  This ensures a better user experience by not displaying the UI elements when there's no data to visualize.

# Activity Summary for 07/05/2025

## 22:59:22
The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` between 22:36:02 and 22:58:28 on July 5th, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent: rendering a merchant data table using Ant Design's `Table` and `Select` components.  The table displays various merchant attributes.  A `MerchantStatusBar` component is also used.

The key changes across the edits are focused on the `Mint Comment` column's rendering logic.

Initially, the `Mint Comment` column simply joined array elements with commas.  Subsequent revisions introduced:

1. **A `convertStringtoArray` function (22:41:33):** This function parses a string (presumably representing a key-value object) into an array of key-value pairs, handling cases where the input is not a string or is improperly formatted.  The output is styled using a `styles.truncateText` class (the definition of which is not included in the log).


2. **Conditional Rendering in `Mint Comment` (22:44:15, 22:44:46):** The `render` function for the "Mint Comment" column was updated to conditionally render either the processed string from `convertStringtoArray` or an empty string/hyphen based on if the value exists or not. The `styles.truncateText` class was removed at 22:44:46.

3. **Iterative Rendering of Mint Comments (22:56:22, 22:57:30, 22:58:28):** The final versions iterate over the `value` which is assumed to be an array of strings, calling `convertStringtoArray` on each element and rendering each as a paragraph with a title and the `styles.truncateText` class conditionally added back at 22:57:30.  The addition of a key prop in the `p` tag is seen at 22:56:22 and it continues in the next updates


Throughout these edits, the `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` array remained largely unchanged, primarily adding categories in the `Category` filter at 22:37:21.  The other changes are refinements in the `Mint Comment` rendering to improve data handling and presentation.  Minor formatting differences are present throughout in quotes and parentheses.  There is also a minor syntax difference in `filterColumnList` function's arrow function.

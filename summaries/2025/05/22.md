# Activity Summary for 22/05/2025

## 16:44:16
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` between 16:26:56 and 16:30:16 on 22/05/2025.  These revisions focused solely on refining the `compareAndCaptureArrayFields` function.  The initial version returned an empty object if either input array was empty or null. Subsequent versions adjusted the handling of empty or null arrays to return default empty arrays for removed and added items.  Finally, the function was further modified to safely handle potentially null or undefined input arrays using optional chaining (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`||`). The changes ensured the function robustly handles various input scenarios.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` was updated at 16:23:21 on 22/05/2025. This file contains a large function `requestMapDiscount` which handles mapping discount data.  It extensively uses helper functions for tasks like mapping collections and products, handling variant mismatches, and comparing arrays. The function shows complex logic for managing various discount types (manual, cart items, bundle, tiered, shipping), minimum requirements, and applying discounts to specific products or collections.  The code processes both existing and new data to determine which products or collections to add or remove from the discount configuration.  The code also demonstrates using Shopify APIs to fetch product and collection data.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`  between 16:48:22 and 17:40:29 on May 22, 2025.  These updates primarily focus on refining the component's functionality, particularly around CSV file uploads for pincodes.  The code remains largely consistent throughout the edits, with no substantial structural changes.  The changes primarily involve minor adjustments and bug fixes.  Importantly, the import statements were modified at 17:12:24 and 17:12:55 to include `downloadFromURL`, `downloadToCSV`, `makeAPICall` from `@gokwik/utilities` and `APIEndPoints` from `@library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints`. This suggests an integration or refactoring effort related to data handling and API calls.  There were no apparent changes to the core logic or component structure of `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` throughout these revisions.  The `api.ts` file was also updated at 17:08:57 and 17:10:33, indicating related changes in the API interaction logic, possibly to support the `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` updates.


## 18:44:17
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` and one revision to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` file was updated on 22/05/2025, 17:51:09. This update involved significant additions to the file, focusing on functions related to managing discounts:  `assignMatchType`, `mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`, `responseMapCollections`, `responseMapProducts`, and `mapProducts`.  These functions handle data mapping and fetching for products, collections, and discount application logic.  The `requestMapDiscount` function was heavily modified, suggesting updates to how discount data is structured and prepared for API requests, likely including the handling of different discount types and their associated parameters.

The `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file underwent several revisions on May 22nd, 2025.  The initial version (17:46:28) contained a React component for configuring shipping methods. It included features for handling shipping prices, advanced conditions, CSV uploads for pincodes, and payment option selection.  A substantial portion of the code deals with Form handling using `gokwik-ui-kit`'s Form component, along with state management for various UI elements (modals, switches, etc.).

The subsequent updates (17:52:04, 18:09:52, 18:11:10, 18:12:41) to `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` show incremental changes.  A notable change is the introduction of `useSelector` and `getMerchantDetails` from `@store/user/selectors` (18:09:52), integrating merchant details into the component.  This was followed by the addition of a `fetchPincodeList` function (18:09:52 and later revisions), which fetches pincode data using `makeAPICall` and  `APIEndPoints.getPincodeListForShipping`, relying on merchant ID for context. The import of `fileImageSvg` was moved in the later commits. The final version includes improvements in error handling and pincode data retrieval,  enhancing the integration with backend APIs and user data.  The overall pattern across all revisions of this file suggests continuous development and refinement of the shipping method configuration UI, adding functionality and improving data management.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` between 16:26:56 and 16:30:16 on 22/05/2025.  These revisions focused solely on refining the `compareAndCaptureArrayFields` function.  The initial version returned an empty object if either input array was empty or null. Subsequent versions adjusted the handling of empty or null arrays to return default empty arrays for removed and added items.  Finally, the function was further modified to safely handle potentially null or undefined input arrays using optional chaining (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`||`). The changes ensured the function robustly handles various input scenarios.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` was updated at 16:23:21 on 22/05/2025. This file contains a large function `requestMapDiscount` which handles mapping discount data.  It extensively uses helper functions for tasks like mapping collections and products, handling variant mismatches, and comparing arrays. The function shows complex logic for managing various discount types (manual, cart items, bundle, tiered, shipping), minimum requirements, and applying discounts to specific products or collections.  The code processes both existing and new data to determine which products or collections to add or remove from the discount configuration.  The code also demonstrates using Shopify APIs to fetch product and collection data.

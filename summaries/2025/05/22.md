# Activity Summary for 22/05/2025

## 16:44:16
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` between 16:26:56 and 16:30:16 on 22/05/2025.  These revisions focused solely on refining the `compareAndCaptureArrayFields` function.  The initial version returned an empty object if either input array was empty or null. Subsequent versions adjusted the handling of empty or null arrays to return default empty arrays for removed and added items.  Finally, the function was further modified to safely handle potentially null or undefined input arrays using optional chaining (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`||`). The changes ensured the function robustly handles various input scenarios.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` was updated at 16:23:21 on 22/05/2025. This file contains a large function `requestMapDiscount` which handles mapping discount data.  It extensively uses helper functions for tasks like mapping collections and products, handling variant mismatches, and comparing arrays. The function shows complex logic for managing various discount types (manual, cart items, bundle, tiered, shipping), minimum requirements, and applying discounts to specific products or collections.  The code processes both existing and new data to determine which products or collections to add or remove from the discount configuration.  The code also demonstrates using Shopify APIs to fetch product and collection data.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`  between 16:48:22 and 17:40:29 on May 22, 2025.  These updates primarily focus on refining the component's functionality, particularly around CSV file uploads for pincodes.  The code remains largely consistent throughout the edits, with no substantial structural changes.  The changes primarily involve minor adjustments and bug fixes.  Importantly, the import statements were modified at 17:12:24 and 17:12:55 to include `downloadFromURL`, `downloadToCSV`, `makeAPICall` from `@gokwik/utilities` and `APIEndPoints` from `@library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints`. This suggests an integration or refactoring effort related to data handling and API calls.  There were no apparent changes to the core logic or component structure of `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` throughout these revisions.  The `api.ts` file was also updated at 17:08:57 and 17:10:33, indicating related changes in the API interaction logic, possibly to support the `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` updates.

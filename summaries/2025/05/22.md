# Activity Summary for 22/05/2025

## 16:44:16
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` between 16:26:56 and 16:30:16 on 22/05/2025.  These revisions focused solely on refining the `compareAndCaptureArrayFields` function.  The initial version returned an empty object if either input array was empty or null. Subsequent versions adjusted the handling of empty or null arrays to return default empty arrays for removed and added items.  Finally, the function was further modified to safely handle potentially null or undefined input arrays using optional chaining (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`||`). The changes ensured the function robustly handles various input scenarios.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` was updated at 16:23:21 on 22/05/2025. This file contains a large function `requestMapDiscount` which handles mapping discount data.  It extensively uses helper functions for tasks like mapping collections and products, handling variant mismatches, and comparing arrays. The function shows complex logic for managing various discount types (manual, cart items, bundle, tiered, shipping), minimum requirements, and applying discounts to specific products or collections.  The code processes both existing and new data to determine which products or collections to add or remove from the discount configuration.  The code also demonstrates using Shopify APIs to fetch product and collection data.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`  between 16:48:22 and 17:40:29 on May 22, 2025.  These updates primarily focus on refining the component's functionality, particularly around CSV file uploads for pincodes.  The code remains largely consistent throughout the edits, with no substantial structural changes.  The changes primarily involve minor adjustments and bug fixes.  Importantly, the import statements were modified at 17:12:24 and 17:12:55 to include `downloadFromURL`, `downloadToCSV`, `makeAPICall` from `@gokwik/utilities` and `APIEndPoints` from `@library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints`. This suggests an integration or refactoring effort related to data handling and API calls.  There were no apparent changes to the core logic or component structure of `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` throughout these revisions.  The `api.ts` file was also updated at 17:08:57 and 17:10:33, indicating related changes in the API interaction logic, possibly to support the `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` updates.


## 18:44:17
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` and one revision to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` file was updated on 22/05/2025, 17:51:09. This update involved significant additions to the file, focusing on functions related to managing discounts:  `assignMatchType`, `mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`, `responseMapCollections`, `responseMapProducts`, and `mapProducts`.  These functions handle data mapping and fetching for products, collections, and discount application logic.  The `requestMapDiscount` function was heavily modified, suggesting updates to how discount data is structured and prepared for API requests, likely including the handling of different discount types and their associated parameters.

The `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file underwent several revisions on May 22nd, 2025.  The initial version (17:46:28) contained a React component for configuring shipping methods. It included features for handling shipping prices, advanced conditions, CSV uploads for pincodes, and payment option selection.  A substantial portion of the code deals with Form handling using `gokwik-ui-kit`'s Form component, along with state management for various UI elements (modals, switches, etc.).

The subsequent updates (17:52:04, 18:09:52, 18:11:10, 18:12:41) to `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` show incremental changes.  A notable change is the introduction of `useSelector` and `getMerchantDetails` from `@store/user/selectors` (18:09:52), integrating merchant details into the component.  This was followed by the addition of a `fetchPincodeList` function (18:09:52 and later revisions), which fetches pincode data using `makeAPICall` and  `APIEndPoints.getPincodeListForShipping`, relying on merchant ID for context. The import of `fileImageSvg` was moved in the later commits. The final version includes improvements in error handling and pincode data retrieval,  enhancing the integration with backend APIs and user data.  The overall pattern across all revisions of this file suggests continuous development and refinement of the shipping method configuration UI, adding functionality and improving data management.


## 20:00:40
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`  and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte` was updated twice on May 22, 2025. The first update at 19:10:27  introduced a Svelte component for handling GST (Goods and Services Tax) information.  The component manages GST number validation, billing address input, and updates related stores.  Event logging is integrated using `logEvent`.  Error handling is implemented using `setErrorMessage` and snackbar messages. The second update at 19:15:58 added a `console.log(response)` statement within the `handleBillingSubmit` function for debugging purposes. No other significant changes are apparent between the two updates.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, updated at 19:11:34, defines functions to determine base URLs for various services based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  It also manages environment-specific variables and token values. The code extensively uses conditional statements to handle different environments, suggesting a complex build and deployment process.  The file also includes functions related to managing a cart object in local storage.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`, updated at 19:12:06, is an HTML file that appears to be a merchant integration page.  It includes a button that triggers a checkout process using `window.postMessage` to send `merchantInfo` data.  The script includes functions for initializing the Gokwik SDK and managing cookies related to landing pages and referrer information.  The `merchantInfo` object contains sensitive information such as merchant ID, app IDs and secrets (redacted for security reasons), which is important to protect. The file contains commented-out code, implying ongoing development and experimentation with analytics and different script loading methods.  The hardcoded merchant information in the `merchantInfo` object raises security concerns.


## 20:49:51
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte`  between 20:02:30 and 20:24:47 on May 22, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on improving error handling and clarifying the user interface related to GST and billing address input.

Specifically, the `handleBillingSubmit` function underwent several iterations.  Early versions lacked comprehensive error handling in the `catch` block, logging errors to the console but not providing user feedback. Later revisions improved error handling by displaying specific error messages from the API response using `snackbar_state`, handling  `quality_indicators`  (especially `is_address_pin_different` to provide more informative pincode mismatch messages).  The error message  "Pincode is different from the address" was changed to "Pincode Mismatch for the address and pincode field".  The generic "something went wrong" message was also replaced with a more descriptive message.

A minor change at 20:24:47 involved replacing double quotes with single quotes in  `GST['billing_address_title'] = 'All fields are mandatory *';`.

The code consistently uses Svelte's reactive declarations and stores (`store_GSTBilling`, `snackbar_state`, etc.) to manage the UI state and interact with backend APIs (`setBillingDetails`, `validateGSTNumber`).  The frequent updates suggest iterative development and debugging, focusing on refining error messages and improving the user experience based on API responses.  The logging of events (`logEvent`) throughout the code indicates attention to tracking user interactions.

# Activity Summary for 27/05/2025

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/index.ts` file, last modified on 27/05/2025 at 00:45:01, contains Redux logic for managing discounts.  Key functionalities include fetching manual and Shopify discounts, handling bulk discounts (including download and deletion), saving and updating discounts, and fetching customer segments.

The code uses `createAsyncThunk` extensively for asynchronous operations, making API calls to endpoints defined in `APIEndPoints`.  These endpoints appear to be related to DIY discounts, bulk discounts, and Shopify integration.  Error handling is implemented using `rejectWithValue` and informative messages from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The code interacts with a backend API using `makeAPICall` and handles various responses, including success and error scenarios.  Significant operations such as fetching, saving, and deleting discounts are implemented with separate async functions.  Helper functions like `fetchAllBulkCampaigns`, `fetchBulkCampaign`, and `handleDownloadBuk` manage interactions with the bulk discount system.  The code also incorporates Shopify-specific features using functions such as `fetchShopifyDiscountsDataAsync` and `shopifyResponseMap`.  The `saveDiscount` function handles both creating and updating discounts, distinguishing between different page contexts and sub-methods (e.g., bulk discounts).  Data mapping and transformation are performed using functions like `requestMapDiscount` and `responseMapDiscount`.  Finally, the code maintains state using `createSlice` and interacts with the root store (`RootStoreType`).

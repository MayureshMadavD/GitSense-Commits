# Activity Summary for 10/05/2025

## 13:31:16
The log shows several code changes across multiple files on October 5th, 2025.  The most significant changes involve the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport` directory.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/barChart.jsx`: This file, primarily concerned with chart rendering, underwent multiple revisions between 11:06:36 and 11:07:36. These revisions appear to be focused on refining the `calculateWeeklyARR` and `calculateMerchantsPerWeek` functions, which handle data aggregation for the charts.  Changes include improved error handling and more robust date parsing and validation, particularly focusing on handling incomplete weeks at the end of reporting periods.  The core functionality remains the same â€“ calculating and presenting weekly ARR and merchant counts.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/dailyreport.jsx`: This component, responsible for displaying the daily report, was updated several times (11:07:04, 11:07:15, 11:10:47, 11:25:18, 11:26:20, 11:26:39, 11:27:10).  The major change was the addition of  `EmergingMerchantsChartForExpress` in the chart section at 11:07:15.  Subsequent changes involved incremental improvements in UI presentation using Tailwind CSS classes like `font-semibold` and restructuring of table elements for better readability, along with  minor bug fixes and refinements to the data fetching and display logic.  There's a recurring pattern of fetching and processing data related to "expectedarr", "platform", "category", "merchantstate", and "mqm", suggesting a consistent data structure across different report sections (Live Merchants, WIP Merchants).

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/search/search.module.css`: This file was modified twice (11:16:30, 11:16:57) with only minor changes affecting the styling of select elements.  The second revision changes the `color` property for the `selectChild option` element from `var(--fontcolor)` to `black`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/navbar/navbar.module.css`: This file was updated at 11:18:09, adding or modifying CSS for a `selectContainer` element to enhance styling related to select dropdown menus within the navbar.


`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/dailyreport.module.css`: This file contains CSS for the daily report's layout. It was updated twice (11:19:04, 11:20:23), with the second revision removing `border: 1px solid #ddd;` from the `.inputText` class.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/textArea.jsx`:  This component, which displays and allows editing of a text area for report summaries,  was revised three times (11:21:43, 11:22:55, 11:23:52).  The changes seem to focus on the styling of the textarea element, changing the border style, and refining the email sending and PDF generation processes.  The core functionality (editing, saving, sending, and PDF download) remains unchanged.  A notable addition is the use of `react-hot-toast` for displaying success or error messages during email sending.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/sidebar/sidebar.jsx`: This file was updated twice (12:56:55, 12:57:31). The changes are purely cosmetic: replacing an Ant Design `Avatar` component with a Next.js `Image` component to display user avatars, using a placeholder image `/noavatar.png`.

In summary, the majority of the changes focus on improving the daily report's functionality and visual presentation, with the most significant activity centered around the `dailyreport.jsx` and `barChart.jsx` files.  There's a consistent theme of handling data related to merchants, their platforms, categories, and ARR,  and a progression of iterative improvements on both the front-end and back-end (email sending) throughout the day.

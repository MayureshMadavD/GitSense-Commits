# Activity Summary for 04/05/2025

## 14:35:16
The log shows significant modifications to environment variables and the addition of UI components.

The `docker-compose.yml` file was updated at 13:36:10 on 04/05/2025,  containing database credentials, authentication details (including Google OAuth), and email server configuration.

Between 13:44:04 and 13:58:02 on 04/05/2025, the `.env` file underwent multiple revisions.  Initially, it contained a local database URL. Subsequent changes transitioned the database to a production AWS RDS instance (`gkwk-dev-mint-dashboard.cog1smbiapc6.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/dashboard`), corrected the `DATABASE_URL` format, updated the `AUTH_URL` from a development URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth`, and switched to a production environment (`NODE_ENV=production`). The `AUTH_GOOGLE_ID` was also changed multiple times, settling on `1098991926902-45hu7g08s9qna75ag88tm4jkeq4ioe79.apps.googleusercontent.com`.  The `PARENT_EMAIL` was changed from `mayuresh.madav@gokwik.co` to `mintupdates@gokwik.co`.


At 14:21:40 on 04/05/2025,  `userPageHandler.jsx` was added, which renders an Ant Design table for user management, including filtering, editing, and deleting functionality.

Finally, `formRendere.jsx` (with a typo in the filename) was created at 14:33:01 and then significantly improved at 14:34:35. The initial version rendered a basic Ant Design form. The improved version adds conditional rendering for input and select fields, making it more flexible and reusable.

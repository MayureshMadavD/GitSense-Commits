# Activity Summary for 01/05/2025

## 13:48:16
The log shows multiple updates to Svelte components and interface definitions within a checkout UI application.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file underwent significant changes at 01/05/2025, 12:58:17 and again at 01/05/2025, 13:05:45.  These updates primarily involve handling events from an iframe, managing application state using numerous Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, various other stores prefixed with `store_`), and rendering various components related to checkout, payment, addresses, and user authentication. The code extensively uses TypeScript for type safety.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Interfaces.ts` file was updated at 01/05/2025, 12:58:37 and 01/05/2025, 13:08:36 and 01/05/2025, 13:11:30, defining various interfaces for data structures used throughout the application, including `LaunchData`, `cartInterface`, `ItemInterface`, and many others. These interfaces describe the structure of data passed between different parts of the application and external services.  There is a recurring theme of handling cart information, payment details, address information, and user data.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts` file was updated at 01/05/2025, 12:58:48 and 01/05/2025, 13:08:44, defining many Svelte stores that manage the application state, particularly around cart data, user information, and various UI elements like snackbars and loaders.  There's considerable overlap in store definitions between this file and the `OrderStore` (implied by the code in `App.svelte`).

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` file shows multiple updates between 01/05/2025, 12:59:47 and 01/05/2025, 13:06:23. This component renders the order summary, handling cart updates, discount calculations, and UI interactions.  The changes primarily focus on refining the display and calculation of the total price, incorporating various discounts, handling free gifts, and improving cart update notifications. The evolution of the code shows gradual additions and refinements to the handling of different discount types and edge cases.  The consistent use of Svelte stores and reactive statements (`$:` ) is a notable characteristic.

In summary, the codebase appears to be a well-structured checkout system with a focus on handling various discount scenarios, payment options, and user flows.  The multiple updates indicate an iterative development process involving bug fixes, feature additions, and UI enhancements, particularly related to discount calculations and cart updates.


## 14:13:00
The code changes involve updates to the checkout dashboard UI, specifically focusing on loyalty points integration.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx` (01/05/2025, 13:15:49): This file contains a React component `RenderForm` responsible for rendering integration forms for various loyalty programs (Pop Coins, Nector, Flits, etc.).  The update introduces significant UI enhancements and conditional rendering based on user configuration.  It includes many form elements (switches, inputs, tooltips) related to enabling/disabling features like COD with loyalty points, stacking discounts, and custom display names.  The code heavily utilizes `gokwik-ui-kit` components and React hooks like `useSelector` and `useState`.  The `resetFields` prop was added to allow for resetting forms.  Several alert messages are defined for different integration scenarios, providing guidance to the user.  The code also includes extensive tooltip explanations clarifying the functionality of various settings.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` (01/05/2025, 13:16:29): This file defines numerous TypeScript interfaces for various data structures used throughout the application.  These interfaces model different aspects of orders, line items, transactions, carts, discounts, and loyalty programs.  The interfaces are comprehensive, indicating a robust data model.  Notably, it includes detailed structures for `Order`, `LineItem`, `Transaction`, `CartItem`, and various payload types related to order editing and discount application. The `CartItem` interface was updated.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/integration-settings/loyaltyPoints.tsx` (01/05/2025, 13:17:48): This file implements the UI for managing loyalty points integrations.  It uses the `RenderForm` component from the previous file update to render customizable forms for each loyalty provider. The component dynamically renders a list of loyalty providers with icons and switches to enable/disable them.  A drawer is used for displaying the customization form.  The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is used to interact with the API for saving configuration changes. The `handleSave` function handles saving configuration changes, including validation and handling potential conflicts between loyalty providers and also ensuring correct data format for the `TransactionMetaDataToUpdateOrder` field specific to Nector. The `deepEqualAndDiff` utility function is used to optimize updates.  The component also provides informative tooltips and error messages to guide the user. The component uses `react-redux` for state management.

The log shows updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`.

The `EnvironmentService.ts` file was modified twice, at 15:21:02 and 15:22:23 on January 5th, 2025.  Both modifications involved changes to the `setCart` function, updating the cart object with different token values and item details.  The core functionality of the file remained largely the same, defining functions to return base URLs for different API endpoints and services based on the environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `analytics_api`, and `analytics_api_v2` functions were extensively updated with multiple conditional statements for handling various environment configurations.  These changes primarily involve mapping different environment variables to corresponding API URLs.  There's also a noticeable pattern of using `gokwik.io` and `gokwik.co` domains for different environments and services.

The `merchant.html` file was updated at 15:21:37 on January 5th, 2025. This update involved adding a script to manage merchant information and initiate the Gokwik SDK.  The script includes functions for handling payment processing, event management, and initialization of the checkout process. The merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`) is hardcoded to a `local` environment, along with other details like store ID and Facebook Pixel ID.  The script also sets cookies to track landing page and referrer information. The commented-out section suggests previous attempts to manage the inclusion of Gokwik JavaScript files.  The script also includes an event listener for a 'ready' message from a modal window before posting merchant information.


## 20:24:18
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file,  updated twice within a short timeframe (15:57:00 and 15:57:15 on January 5th, 2025).  These updates appear to be minor adjustments to the `api_url` function within `EnvironmentService.ts`.  Specifically, the change involves uncommenting a line that sets the URL to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` for the 'local' environment.  Other functions within the file define base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, experiment, Twidpay API, KP API, analytics),  CDN paths, and merchant URLs, all dynamically determined based on the current environment (`env` variable).  The `env` variable is subscribed to changes in the `LoginStore` suggesting a dynamic configuration based on the user login context.  The code also includes functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) based on the environment.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with a seemingly sensitive token (though the actual use of this token is outside the scope of this log).

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file, modified at 15:57:48 on January 5th, 2025, is an HTML file for a merchant page. It incorporates a GoKwik SDK for checkout functionality,  includes merchant information (mid, appid, appsecret, etc.,  which should be treated as sensitive),  and manages cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`).  The script also handles communication with the GoKwik SDK through postMessage.  The file contains commented-out code which might indicate work in progress or previous versions of the integration. The included analytics script is also commented out.

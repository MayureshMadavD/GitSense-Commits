# Activity Summary for 17/05/2025

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/barChart.jsx` file underwent two revisions on May 17, 2025.  The first revision (00:51:48) included code for a bar chart displaying Shopify EARR data for SMB and ENT merchants.  This involved functions to calculate weekly ARR, number of merchants per week, and to generate data for the chart using `react-chartjs-2` and `chartjs-plugin-datalabels`.  The second revision (00:53:56) added `BarController` to the `ChartJS.register` statement, likely to improve bar chart functionality within the existing chart code. No other functional changes are apparent between these two commits.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` was modified twice on May 17, 2025. The first change (00:55:40) used `npm ci` for dependency installation. The second change (00:58:10) switched to using `npm install -f` (force install) instead of `npm ci`.  Both versions use a Node.js 20 Alpine base image, expose port 3000, and perform Prisma schema generation and application building within the Docker container. The difference lies solely in the method of dependency installation, suggesting a potential troubleshooting step to resolve a dependency issue.

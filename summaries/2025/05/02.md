# Activity Summary for 02/05/2025

## 14:08:51
The log shows two entries for `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, both on February 5th, 2025.  The entries are nearly identical, differing only by a few seconds in their timestamps (13:10:21 and 13:10:44).  The file contains functions that define base URLs for various services based on the current environment (`env`).  These functions handle different environments like `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, and `production`, each mapping to a distinct URL.  There are also functions that return specific tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) depending on the environment. Notably, a `setCart()` function initializes a cart object with substantial data, including product details and pricing information.  The  `api_url` function shows a large number of conditional statements to handle multiple API endpoints based on the environment.  The minimal change between the two timestamps suggests that either a very minor code adjustment occurred, or the log simply captured two nearly identical states.

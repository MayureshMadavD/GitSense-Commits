# Activity Summary for 13/05/2025

## 23:10:12
The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/reports/dailyReport/dailyreport.jsx` file underwent two revisions on May 13th, 2025.  The first revision (23:06:26)  contained React code that displays a daily report, summarizing data for SMB, ENT, and Emerging merchants.  The report includes tables showing live and pending merchants, categorized by various fields (platform, category, merchant state, MQM status), and their corresponding expected ARR.  The code uses several custom functions from `reportfunctions.js` for data manipulation (filtering, aggregation).  It also incorporates charts (SMBMerchantsChart and EmergingMerchantsChart) for data visualization.


The second revision (23:10:08) added `Row` and `Col` components, suggesting the integration of a responsive grid layout library, likely Ant Design or a similar framework, to improve the report's presentation on different screen sizes.  Minor code formatting adjustments were also made, primarily involving improved spacing around function parameters and arrow functions.  The core functionality and data presentation remained largely unchanged.  No significant changes in data processing or logic were observed between revisions. The addition of the grid components is the most noticeable change between the two versions.

# Activity Summary for 25/05/2025

## 13:38:03
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx` file between 12:43:04 and 13:35:00 on May 25, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on improving the shipping settings page of a checkout dashboard UI.

Initially, the file lacked a tabbed interface for managing different shipping settings (shipping methods, weight-based shipping, discount-based shipping).  A `NoShippingAvailableMesage` component was introduced to handle cases where no shipping rules were defined.

Subsequent commits introduced a tabbed interface (`Tabs` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`) to organize these settings.  Each tab represents a different type of shipping configuration:

* **Shipping Method:**  Configures base shipping prices.
* **Weight Based Shipping:** Configures shipping rates based on weight.
* **Discount Based Shipping:** Configures shipping discounts.

The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is used to interact with the backend API for fetching and saving configuration data.  Early versions used separate save handlers (`handleShippingSave`, `handleWeightSave`, `handleDiscountSave`), but later versions consolidated these into a single `saveConfig` handler within `useMerchantConfigApi`. A key change was implementing different HTTP methods (POST for the initial shipping method configuration and PATCH for subsequent modifications of weight and discount configurations). This was achieved by setting the `patch` property of  `useMerchantConfigApi` based on the selected tab.

The refactoring also involved changes in how the `refetch` functionality was handled, initially using separate `refetch` functions for each tab, which were later consolidated using the `refetch` function from `merchantConfigHook`.  The code also incorporates error handling and informative messages using the `Alert` component for missing shipping ranges.  The `updateBreadcrumbs` function consistently updates the navigation breadcrumbs.  Throughout the revisions, the code maintains consistent use of  `gokwik-ui-kit` components for UI elements and follows a functional component structure using React hooks.


## 14:38:07
The log shows a series of code changes made to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src` directory, specifically focusing on the shipping settings component of a checkout dashboard UI.  The main file modified is `index.tsx` within the `shipping-settings` folder.

The initial commits to `index.tsx` (13:38:47, 13:39:09) established the basic structure of the shipping settings page. This includes fetching merchant configuration data using `useMerchantConfigApi`, displaying different shipping methods (Shipping Method, Weight Based Shipping, Discount Based Shipping) using tabs, and handling saving of configurations through `handleShippingSave`, `handleWeightSave`, and `handleDiscountSave`.  These functions initially all used `merchantConfig.saveConfig` without specifying the HTTP method.

A significant change occurred at 13:42:03.  The code was refactored to use a single `useMerchantConfigApi` hook, and the HTTP method (POST or PATCH) was determined within the save handlers (`handleShippingSave`, `handleWeightSave`, `handleDiscountSave`).  An alternative implementation using direct `fetch` calls was also commented out, suggesting an exploration of different approaches to API interactions.  The `patch` parameter in `useMerchantConfigApi` was set to `false` by default, controlled by the selected tab.

Further changes in `index.tsx` involved simplifying the state management and refining the conditional rendering based on the presence of shipping options. There was a series of minor edits around 13:50, 13:55, and finally the significant changes around 14:05 onwards.

Between 14:05 and 14:37, the code underwent several iterations to improve the management of the tab state. Initially, state was managed directly in `index.tsx` and passed as props to `ShippingService`. This was improved by moving it to `ShippingService` for better state management within that component. The `patch` parameter for `useMerchantConfigApi` in `index.tsx` was adjusted to correctly reflect whether a POST or PATCH request was needed based on the active tab.  The use of `useMemo` was explored briefly to optimize the `useMerchantConfigApi` hook calls but eventually reverted.  Finally, at 14:37, a separate `patchCall` hook was introduced, along with a refactor to `ShippingService` to accept this hook as a prop, instead of the original approach.

`shipping-component/shippingBasedError.tsx` was modified at 13:43:34 to introduce a component (`ShippingRangeChecker`) that helps identify gaps in defined shipping ranges, displaying warnings to the user.  This component incorporates pagination for a better user experience.

The `shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx` file was heavily modified (13:43:54 to 14:35:59). Changes centered around managing the configuration for different shipping types, refactoring how POST and PATCH requests were handled, and simplifying the logic related to refetching data after saving changes.  The file was finally simplified, removing redundant state and using the single `merchantConfig` instance from props.

The addition of `useCache: false` to `useMerchantConfigApi` in `index.tsx` (13:52:31) indicates a deliberate attempt to bypass caching.

In summary, the changes demonstrate a progressive refinement of the shipping settings component, focusing on:
* Improved API interaction using a single hook and conditional HTTP methods.
* Enhanced state management, especially for tabs and HTTP method selection.
* Better handling of missing shipping data through the introduction of the `ShippingRangeChecker` component.
* Optimization attempts using `useMemo` and removal of caching using `useCache:false`.


The overall pattern is one of iterative development, with several attempts at optimizing code structure and API calls to improve efficiency and maintainability.


## 15:52:29
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx` and one revision to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx`.  The changes primarily focus on the `Shipping` component and its interaction with a `ShippingService` component.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx`**: This file was updated once at 14:39:19 on 25/05/2025.  The update introduced a functional component `ShippingService` that renders different shipping configurations (Shipping Method, Weight Based Shipping, Discount Based Shipping) using tabs.  It uses `useMerchantConfigApi` for fetching and saving configuration data, with separate save handlers for different shipping types (patch and non-patch calls).

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx`**: This file underwent several revisions between 14:39:01 and 14:41:31 on 25/05/2025. The core functionality remained consistent:  conditionally rendering either a "No Shipping Available" message or the `ShippingService` component based on the presence of shipping options.  The key changes are:

* **14:39:01:** Initial version, showing basic structure and usage of `useMerchantConfigApi`.
* **14:39:46:** Minor change; likely a typo correction in passing the `setCurrentTab` function to `ShippingService`.
* **14:40:22:** Modification of the `useMemo` hook in `patchCall`. The dependency array changed from `[tab]` to `[tab !== '1']`, potentially to optimize re-renders.
* **14:40:52:** Reverted the change made at 14:40:22, restoring the dependency array back to `[tab]`.
* **14:41:31:**  `patchCall` was changed from a `useMemo` hook to a regular function, suggesting a refactoring to simplify the logic or to address a performance issue.

Recurring elements across the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx` revisions include consistent use of:

* `useMerchantConfigApi` for fetching and updating merchant configuration.
* `updateBreadcrumbs` for updating the breadcrumb navigation.
* UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (`Col`, `Row`, `Tabs`).


The repeated modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx` suggest iterative development and debugging, particularly around the `patchCall` function and its usage within the `useMemo` hook.  The final version appears to be a stable state after some experimentation with optimization and refactoring.

# Activity Summary for 25/05/2025

## 13:38:03
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/index.tsx` file between 12:43:04 and 13:35:00 on May 25, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on improving the shipping settings page of a checkout dashboard UI.

Initially, the file lacked a tabbed interface for managing different shipping settings (shipping methods, weight-based shipping, discount-based shipping).  A `NoShippingAvailableMesage` component was introduced to handle cases where no shipping rules were defined.

Subsequent commits introduced a tabbed interface (`Tabs` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`) to organize these settings.  Each tab represents a different type of shipping configuration:

* **Shipping Method:**  Configures base shipping prices.
* **Weight Based Shipping:** Configures shipping rates based on weight.
* **Discount Based Shipping:** Configures shipping discounts.

The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is used to interact with the backend API for fetching and saving configuration data.  Early versions used separate save handlers (`handleShippingSave`, `handleWeightSave`, `handleDiscountSave`), but later versions consolidated these into a single `saveConfig` handler within `useMerchantConfigApi`. A key change was implementing different HTTP methods (POST for the initial shipping method configuration and PATCH for subsequent modifications of weight and discount configurations). This was achieved by setting the `patch` property of  `useMerchantConfigApi` based on the selected tab.

The refactoring also involved changes in how the `refetch` functionality was handled, initially using separate `refetch` functions for each tab, which were later consolidated using the `refetch` function from `merchantConfigHook`.  The code also incorporates error handling and informative messages using the `Alert` component for missing shipping ranges.  The `updateBreadcrumbs` function consistently updates the navigation breadcrumbs.  Throughout the revisions, the code maintains consistent use of  `gokwik-ui-kit` components for UI elements and follows a functional component structure using React hooks.

# Activity Summary for 21/05/2025

## 00:15:19
The log shows a series of rapid code changes made to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/dashboard/page.jsx` between 23:57 on May 20, 2025 and 00:13 on May 21, 2025.  The majority of changes center around `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx`, which appears to be a React component responsible for displaying and managing merchant data.


`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` modifications:

* **Initial version (20/05/2025, 23:57:00):**  This commit established the base component, including Ant Design components (Button, Col, Form, etc.),  hooks (useEffect, useState, useRef), custom components (MerchantStatusBar, FormRenderer), functions for data manipulation (`convertStringtoArray`, `createOptionsListForFilter`, etc.), and backend query functions (`createNewMerchant`, `deletEntryForMerchant`, `updateMerchantByID`). The component renders a table with merchant data and includes functionality for adding, editing, and deleting merchants.  The `formFeilds` array defines the form fields for merchant data input.


* **Subsequent commits (21/05/2025, 00:00:36 - 00:11:14):** These commits iteratively refined the "CE Name" field within the `formFeilds` array.  The initial changes involved adjusting how the options for this select field were generated, initially from `merchantData` and later directly from `allUserList` via mapping usernames.  The visibility logic of this field (`hidden` property) based on user roles (`currentUser?.isAdmin` and `currentUser?.Profiledetails?.islead`) was also tweaked several times. Finally, `inputProps` were added to allow for searching within the select field.



`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/dashboard/page.jsx` modifications:

* **Initial version (21/05/2025, 00:10:27):** This commit introduced a server-side component fetching and filtering merchant data based on user ID, admin status, and optional date range parameters (`start`, `endDate`, `mode`). It then renders the `DashboardMain` component with the filtered data. The filtering logic handles filtering by `livedate`, `kickoff`, and `targetgolive` based on the `mode` parameter.

* **Subsequent commit (21/05/2025, 00:11:46):** This minor commit removed unnecessary Ant Design imports (`Col`, `Row`) simplifying the component structure.



`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/dashBoardMain.jsx` modifications:

* **Multiple commits (21/05/2025, 00:09:20 - 00:13:38):** These commits involved refinements and debugging of the `DashboardMain` component,  which displays dashboard cards and charts. The primary changes focus on logging statements added for debugging purposes (`console.log`) and a typo correction (`consle` changed to `console`). The logging of `alltheMerchantList` was switched to logging `chartData` in the last commit.  A loading indicator (`LoadingFunction`) is used while data is fetched.


Overall Pattern:

The changes reflect an iterative development process, focusing on improving the merchant data display and filtering capabilities of the dashboard.  The rapid sequence of commits suggests debugging and refinement of the UI component (`merchant.jsx`) and data fetching/filtering logic in the server component (`page.jsx`). The use of Ant Design, React hooks, and custom functions demonstrates a structured approach to building the application.

The code is a TypeScript file (`CleverTap.ts`) that integrates with CleverTap, an analytics platform.  The file, updated on 21/05/2025 at 05:18:58, contains functions to track various events throughout the checkout process.  These events include user phone number entry (`phoneNumber`), mobile addition (`mobileAddedGK`), pin code entry (`pinCode`), payment method selection (`paymentMethod`), payment completion (`paymentCompleted`), user address entry (`userAddress`, `userAddressDetail`), and checkout start (`checkoutStarted`), as well as coupon application success/failure (`coupon_applied_success_gk`, `coupon_applied_failed_gk`).

The `pushCleverTap` function is central, sending data to CleverTap. It handles events differently based on a `split_product_array_to_multiple_events` flag, either pushing a single event or multiple events for each product.

A significant portion of the code maps internal data keys to CleverTap's expected keys (`mappedKey`). This mapping is consistently used across various event tracking functions.  Data transformation, particularly converting specific keys to strings (`convertSpecificKeysToStrings`), is also prominent.

Several functions (`cleverTapPhoneNumber`, `cleverTapMobileGK`, `cleverTapPincode`, `clevertapPaymentMethod`, `cleverTapPaymentCompleted`, `cleverTapUserAddress`, `cleverTapUserAddressDetailed`, `cleverTapDiscountEvent`) build event data objects tailored to their respective event types.  These often include user details (name, phone, email, address), product information, order details, and marketing data (UTM parameters).  Conditional logic is used to handle different scenarios (e.g., Levi's specific handling, sandbox environments).  The code shows considerable effort in formatting phone numbers and handling potential `null` or `undefined` values.  There's also  conditional logic based on the origin of the `window.location` to tailor CleverTap event data for various domains (e.g., 'levi', 'snitch', 'sandbox-plus').

The provided code log shows multiple revisions of several analytics tracking files (`Contlo.ts`, `CleverTap.ts`, `Moengage.ts`, `WebEngage.ts`) and a `ForeignAnalytics.ts` file that orchestrates them.  All changes occur on May 21, 2025, between 05:21 and 05:56.  The core functionality across all files involves sending event data to various analytics platforms (Contlo, CleverTap, Moengage, WebEngage) upon different checkout events.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts`**: This file underwent several revisions.  The main changes involve minor modifications to the `abc_url` parameter handling within the `contloDiscountEvent` function and the removal of redundant `eventName` parameter from the `contloSendEvent` function.  The core structure of event handling (e.g., `mobileAddedGK`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, etc.) remained consistent throughout the revisions.  The `createBody` function consistently prepares the data payload for Contlo, gathering product IDs, user information, and marketing data.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/CleverTap.ts`**: This file remains largely unchanged across its appearances in the log.  It defines functions to send events to CleverTap, using a `mappedKey` object to translate event data keys to CleverTap-specific names. The `pushCleverTap` function handles the logic for sending events, with a conditional to split product array data into multiple events based on `analyticsPixelObj`.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Moengage.ts`**: This file is dedicated to Moengage tracking. The `createBody` function formats data for Moengage, handling comma-separated values for certain fields based on the merchant ID (`mid`). Several functions (`moengageDiscountEvent`, `moengageStartedCheckout`, etc.) handle specific checkout events, sending data to Moengage via the `fireEvents` function. The `fireEvents` function includes logic for handling different Moengage identification methods (`pixelIdentifier`).


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/WebEngage.ts`**: This file shows similar patterns to the other analytics files. It defines functions for sending data to WebEngage for various checkout events.  Key modifications include additions and removals of fields within the `createBody` function and adding and removing  `Abandoned URL` and other ABC parameters in several event functions.  The `webengagePhoneNumber` function handles user login and attribute setting based on the `analyticsPixelObj`. A `setNoteAttribute` function prepares custom attributes.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**: This file acts as a central point to manage and dispatch analytics events to various platforms based on the event name and data. It subscribes to several stores to retrieve relevant data such as user address, payment method, order details, and marketing information. It uses a `configObject` to manage which analytics pixels are enabled, and the logic for dispatching includes handling several conditional aspects based on the merchant ID and other parameters like `aov_threshold`, and conditional functions for checking Snapchat pixel events. The `adSourceMapping` function parses and maps UTM parameters from a source URL.  The code also computes a `priceBreakup` object, which aggregates various price components (subtotal, discounts, shipping, etc.).  There is also considerable effort to handle data normalization and conversion (e.g., comma separation for some fields, numerical conversions).

The recurring pattern across all files is the use of a `createBody` function to format data for specific analytics platforms and a series of functions to handle different stages of the checkout process.  The timestamps indicate a concentrated effort to update the analytics tracking around the same time. The use of `commonAnalyticsData` suggests a centralized data store for commonly used analytics data across all platforms.  Significant changes involved refining data handling for `abc_url` and adding/removing various data points.

The log shows code changes on May 21, 2025, primarily focusing on a React-based checkout dashboard UI.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` was updated at 13:47:00.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML based on the environment (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  The key change involves configuring import maps for different environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  Import maps define where to load various modules (`@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, etc.),  differentiating between local development URLs and various deployment environments (dev, qa, sandbox).  Production environment includes additional scripts for clarity and New Relic monitoring, likely for performance tracking.  The  New Relic initialization includes settings for distributed tracing, error handling, and various performance monitoring aspects.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` was updated at 13:47:47. This component handles shipping method configuration within the dashboard. It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements.  The component manages forms for shipping prices, including advanced conditions, CSV uploads for pincodes, and customer segment selection.  The CSV upload functionality validates the format and content of the uploaded file, ensuring that pincodes are correctly formatted. The component dynamically updates based on user interactions (e.g., enabling/disabling fields, showing/hiding modals).  Error handling is integrated to provide feedback to the user during form submission.  A noteworthy feature is the ability to download CSV files, likely containing the shipping configuration data.  The component interacts with a Redux-like store (`useAppDispatch`, `fetchCustomerSegments`, `downloadCsvFile`, `requestForShippingModule`) for data fetching and updates.  The UI elements make extensive use of React components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and includes features like tooltips and error handling.

# Activity Summary for 15/05/2025

## 00:00:08
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/extraFunctionForMerchant.jsx` between 23:16:50 and 23:59:28 on 14/05/2025.  These revisions primarily focus on the `summarizeMerchantData` function.  Initially, this function summarized merchant data by category, calculating the sum of `expectedarr`, average difference in days between `livedate` and `kickoff`, and the count of blocked merchants.  Subsequent revisions involved several iterations, refining the logic for date handling (`isValid` checks) and the calculation of the average days. The final version at 23:59:28 uses the `filterAllTheMerchant` function from `@/backend/backendservice` to preprocess the data before mapping over the `smbData` to generate a summarized view.  The other functions in the file (`createOptionsListForFilter`, `convertStringtoArray`, `getNumericFilterDropdown`, `getNumericOnFilter`, `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`, `getDateRangeOnFilter`, `exportDataToCsv`) remained unchanged throughout the revision period.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/dashboard/users/page.jsx` (23:10:57) and `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/dashboard/page.jsx` (23:14:22) were also updated on the same day.  The former displays user data using a `UsersPageHandler` component, while the latter presents a dashboard with charts and cards displaying merchant data, featuring robust filtering and error handling.  Both pages implement user authentication checks using `getCurrentUserSessionDetails`. The `dashboard/page.jsx` file includes extensive date filtering logic based on user input (`start`, `endDate`, `mode`).

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/extraFunctionForMerchant.jsx` file underwent several revisions on May 15, 2025.  The primary focus of these changes was the `summarizeMerchantData` function.

Initially, this function logged an array of objects, each containing a `name` (category) and `average` (difference in days between `livedate` and `kickoff`).  A subsequent change at 00:03:04 added a check for `isValid` date to prevent errors and returned 0 if invalid. At 00:45:53, the `name` field was removed. Further modifications at 00:46:49 and 00:47:12 didn't alter the function's core logic. At 00:48:04, `merchantname` field was added. At 00:50:10, the function was dramatically altered to calculate the sum of `average` values using `.reduce()` instead of returning an array.  The final version, at 00:54:27,  calculates the average of the `average` values by dividing the sum by the number of items in `cat.smbData` and converts the result to an integer using `parseInt()`.

Other functions within the file, including `createOptionsListForFilter`, `convertStringtoArray`, `getNumericFilterDropdown`, `getNumericOnFilter`, `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`, `getDateRangeOnFilter`, and `exportDataToCsv` remained unchanged throughout all the commits.  These functions handle various filtering and data manipulation tasks.  The `exportDataToCsv` function shows that certain keys (`createdAt`, `updateat`, `userId`, `id`) are consistently removed during data sanitization before export.  The code consistently uses Ant Design components (`Button`, `InputNumber`, `Select`, `Space`, `DatePicker`) for the UI elements.  The timestamps show a period of intensive modification between 00:00 and 00:54, likely corresponding to the iterative development and refinement of the `summarizeMerchantData` function.

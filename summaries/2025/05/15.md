# Activity Summary for 15/05/2025

## 00:00:08
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/extraFunctionForMerchant.jsx` between 23:16:50 and 23:59:28 on 14/05/2025.  These revisions primarily focus on the `summarizeMerchantData` function.  Initially, this function summarized merchant data by category, calculating the sum of `expectedarr`, average difference in days between `livedate` and `kickoff`, and the count of blocked merchants.  Subsequent revisions involved several iterations, refining the logic for date handling (`isValid` checks) and the calculation of the average days. The final version at 23:59:28 uses the `filterAllTheMerchant` function from `@/backend/backendservice` to preprocess the data before mapping over the `smbData` to generate a summarized view.  The other functions in the file (`createOptionsListForFilter`, `convertStringtoArray`, `getNumericFilterDropdown`, `getNumericOnFilter`, `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`, `getDateRangeOnFilter`, `exportDataToCsv`) remained unchanged throughout the revision period.

`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/dashboard/users/page.jsx` (23:10:57) and `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/dashboard/page.jsx` (23:14:22) were also updated on the same day.  The former displays user data using a `UsersPageHandler` component, while the latter presents a dashboard with charts and cards displaying merchant data, featuring robust filtering and error handling.  Both pages implement user authentication checks using `getCurrentUserSessionDetails`. The `dashboard/page.jsx` file includes extensive date filtering logic based on user input (`start`, `endDate`, `mode`).

# Activity Summary for 28/05/2025

## 18:18:01
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentOptions.service.ts`  between 17:41:39 and 18:10:57 on 28/05/2025.  These updates appear to be minor edits and do not change the core functionality of the file. The file uses numerous Svelte stores (`store_...`) from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage application state related to payment options.  The code heavily uses imports related to payment processing, including various payment gateways and methods (UPI, Netbanking, COD, etc.).  The consistent structure across the edits suggests iterative development or bug fixing rather than substantial feature additions.  There's a significant reliance on environment variables (`env`) to configure various API endpoints and token values based on different environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The `initializeStoreValues` function subscribes to many stores, updating local variables based on store changes.  This suggests a reactive architecture using Svelte's reactive declarations.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated at 17:18:58 on 28/05/2025. This update involves client-side JavaScript code that initializes the Gokwik SDK, sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), and manages communication with the Gokwik SDK using `window.postMessage`.  The code includes placeholder comments and commented-out sections that may indicate ongoing development.  The merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`) is hardcoded, suggesting that a more dynamic approach might be implemented later. The inclusion of a `gokwik-button` with hardcoded data (mid, appid, appsecret) indicates a connection to a specific Gokwik application.

The log shows a single code update to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/analyticsHeader.tsx` on 28/05/2025 at 18:32:57.  This file contains a React component, `AnalyticsHeader`, for an analytics dashboard.

The component's key updates include:

* **Date Range Selection:**  The component uses `AnalyticsDateRangePicker` to allow users to select date ranges for analytics.  It logs events (`kwik_checkout_analytics_date_selected_clicked`, `kwik_website_analytics_date_selected_clicked`, `kwik_discount_analytics_date_selected_clicked`)  using `logEvent` upon date selection, differentiating between checkout, website, and discount analytics.  A `disabledDate` function prevents selection of dates before April 1st, 2025, for website analytics.

* **Checkout Platform Selection:** A `Select` component allows choosing between different checkout platforms (`checkoutPlatformKeys`), updating local storage and potentially navigating to a different URL (`/shopify-app/analytics`) based on the selection.

* **Sales Channel Filtering:** Another `Select` component filters data by sales channel (web, app, all).

* **Screen Selection:** A `Segmented` control allows switching between "Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," and "Website Analytics" views. This updates the application state using `dispatch(setCurrentScreen(...))`.

The code utilizes several external libraries including `dayjs`, `react-redux`, `single-spa`, and components from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The code is well-structured and leverages functional components and hooks.  The consistent use of `logEvent` for tracking user interactions is noteworthy.  The handling of different analytics screens ('checkout', 'website', 'discount') is a recurring theme throughout the component's logic.

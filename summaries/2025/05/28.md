# Activity Summary for 28/05/2025

## 18:18:01
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentOptions.service.ts`  between 17:41:39 and 18:10:57 on 28/05/2025.  These updates appear to be minor edits and do not change the core functionality of the file. The file uses numerous Svelte stores (`store_...`) from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage application state related to payment options.  The code heavily uses imports related to payment processing, including various payment gateways and methods (UPI, Netbanking, COD, etc.).  The consistent structure across the edits suggests iterative development or bug fixing rather than substantial feature additions.  There's a significant reliance on environment variables (`env`) to configure various API endpoints and token values based on different environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The `initializeStoreValues` function subscribes to many stores, updating local variables based on store changes.  This suggests a reactive architecture using Svelte's reactive declarations.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated at 17:18:58 on 28/05/2025. This update involves client-side JavaScript code that initializes the Gokwik SDK, sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), and manages communication with the Gokwik SDK using `window.postMessage`.  The code includes placeholder comments and commented-out sections that may indicate ongoing development.  The merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`) is hardcoded, suggesting that a more dynamic approach might be implemented later. The inclusion of a `gokwik-button` with hardcoded data (mid, appid, appsecret) indicates a connection to a specific Gokwik application.


## 20:12:35
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/analytics-screen/analyticsHeader.tsx` on 28/05/2025 at 18:32:57.  This file contains a React component, `AnalyticsHeader`, for an analytics dashboard.

The component's key updates include:

* **Date Range Selection:**  The component uses `AnalyticsDateRangePicker` to allow users to select date ranges for analytics.  It logs events (`kwik_checkout_analytics_date_selected_clicked`, `kwik_website_analytics_date_selected_clicked`, `kwik_discount_analytics_date_selected_clicked`)  using `logEvent` upon date selection, differentiating between checkout, website, and discount analytics.  A `disabledDate` function prevents selection of dates before April 1st, 2025, for website analytics.

* **Checkout Platform Selection:** A `Select` component allows choosing between different checkout platforms (`checkoutPlatformKeys`), updating local storage and potentially navigating to a different URL (`/shopify-app/analytics`) based on the selection.

* **Sales Channel Filtering:** Another `Select` component filters data by sales channel (web, app, all).

* **Screen Selection:** A `Segmented` control allows switching between "Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," and "Website Analytics" views. This updates the application state using `dispatch(setCurrentScreen(...))`.

The code utilizes several external libraries including `dayjs`, `react-redux`, `single-spa`, and components from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The code is well-structured and leverages functional components and hooks.  The consistent use of `logEvent` for tracking user interactions is noteworthy.  The handling of different analytics screens ('checkout', 'website', 'discount') is a recurring theme throughout the component's logic.


## 21:31:46
The log shows code changes across two files on May 28, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 20:41:33.  This file is an HTML page containing a merchant checkout button.  The code includes JavaScript for interacting with a GoKwik SDK (`gokwik.js`), setting cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), and handling postMessage events for payment processing.  The  `merchantInfo` object contains various merchant IDs (`mid`) for different environments (local, qa, sandbox, production), indicating support for multiple deployment stages.  The file also shows integration with other services like Privy (a marketing tool) and includes analytics tracking.  The commented-out section suggests previous attempts to integrate analytics using `devanalytics.js`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated at 20:41:59.  This TypeScript file manages environment-specific configurations, defining base URLs for various APIs (health checks, address suggestions, core API, cred URL, experiment API, TwidPay API, KP API) based on the `env` variable.  The code also includes functions to set and get URLs for different API endpoints based on various environment variables (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local` etc).  The  `local` environment is treated specially, having multiple fallback options for API URLs.  The code also manages tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that vary depending on the environment, further pointing to a multi-environment setup.  There's also logic for setting up a sample cart object (`setCart`) for the `local` environment.  The file extensively uses environment variables to dynamically determine API endpoints and other configuration parameters.  Multiple API endpoints for analytics (`analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`) are also defined, showing a versioning scheme for the analytics backend.

The second update to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentOptions.service.ts` at 20:44:40 appears to be almost identical to the file's state at 20:44:04. The only difference is likely due to a minor code formatting change, not representing a functional update. Therefore, the summary will only include details from the 20:44:04 timestamp. This file, also in TypeScript, is a service for managing payment options within a checkout process. It heavily relies on many Svelte stores (`store_...`) to maintain state, indicating a reactive architecture. It includes functions and variable declarations for handling various payment methods (UPI, netbanking, cards, etc), error handling (`APIErrorHandling`), integrating various third-party payment gateways (CredPay, Snapmint, Bharatx, PayInX), and managing UI elements (confirmation boxes, error messages).  The significant use of numerous stores and functions highlights the complexity of managing different payment flows and handling various scenarios (risk assessments, fallback flows).  There's also substantial code for handling the display and selection of payment methods and related UI elements. The extensive use of stores suggests state management using the Svelte framework.  The code also integrates with analytics tracking ( `logEvent`, `logEventV2`) indicating that usage data is being monitored.

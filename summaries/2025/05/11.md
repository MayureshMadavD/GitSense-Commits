# Activity Summary for 11/05/2025

The provided log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/rightbar/rightbar.jsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/singleMerchants/merchantsupdate.jsx`.  The `rightbar.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 23:39:53 and 23:43:16 on October 5th, 2025, primarily focusing on styling and layout adjustments for an "Export" button within an Ant Design `Row` and `Col` component.  The button's styling was enhanced with `className` attributes adding `w-full`, `shadow-md`, `shadow-gray-400`, and finally `type="primary"`.  The core CSV export functionality within the `exportDataToCsv` function remained largely unchanged during these edits.

A more substantial change to `rightbar.jsx` occurred on November 5th, 2025, at 10:49:59.  This revision significantly refactored the `exportDataToCsv` function. The older, more complex filtering and data manipulation methods were replaced with a cleaner approach using `keysToRemove` array to remove specific keys (`createdAt`, `updateat`, `userId`, `id`) and a more straightforward sanitization of the `mintcomment` field.  The CSV generation process also improved by replacing line breaks and commas within the data values, and handling `undefined`, `null` and empty string values to replace it with "NA".

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/singleMerchants/merchantsupdate.jsx` file was updated only once on November 5th, 2025, at 10:52:55. This update introduced a substantial React component responsible for displaying and managing merchant data. It includes features for editing various merchant attributes (comments, category, platform, etc.), pagination, and filtering capabilities. The component uses Ant Design and React Select for UI elements and manages data updates via functions like `updateMerchantByID` and `deletEntryForMerchant`.  The filtering functionality allows users to filter by various data fields including expected ARR using comparative operators.  The component also includes custom pagination controls.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/search/search.jsx` file was updated on 11/05/2025 at 11:14:10.  This React component (`Search`) implements a search functionality with filtering options.  The search uses `next/navigation` hooks for routing and URL parameter manipulation.  The component dynamically renders different search input fields (selects or text input) based on the selected filter.  Available filters depend on the user's role (`isAdmin`) and the current route (`path`).  The search functionality is debounced using `useDebouncedCallback` to prevent excessive updates.  The component uses Ant Design (`Button`, `EditOutlined`, `select`) for UI elements.  The search handles different search types ("cename", "merchantstate", "status", "mqm", "merchantname") and updates URL parameters accordingly.  The "status" filter conditionally displays an MQM (likely "Merchant Quality Metrics") select. The component receives `userData` and `targetdetails` props, presumably for populating select options.

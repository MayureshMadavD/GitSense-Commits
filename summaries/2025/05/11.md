# Activity Summary for 11/05/2025

The provided log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/rightbar/rightbar.jsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/singleMerchants/merchantsupdate.jsx`.  The `rightbar.jsx` file underwent several revisions between 23:39:53 and 23:43:16 on October 5th, 2025, primarily focusing on styling and layout adjustments for an "Export" button within an Ant Design `Row` and `Col` component.  The button's styling was enhanced with `className` attributes adding `w-full`, `shadow-md`, `shadow-gray-400`, and finally `type="primary"`.  The core CSV export functionality within the `exportDataToCsv` function remained largely unchanged during these edits.

A more substantial change to `rightbar.jsx` occurred on November 5th, 2025, at 10:49:59.  This revision significantly refactored the `exportDataToCsv` function. The older, more complex filtering and data manipulation methods were replaced with a cleaner approach using `keysToRemove` array to remove specific keys (`createdAt`, `updateat`, `userId`, `id`) and a more straightforward sanitization of the `mintcomment` field.  The CSV generation process also improved by replacing line breaks and commas within the data values, and handling `undefined`, `null` and empty string values to replace it with "NA".

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/singleMerchants/merchantsupdate.jsx` file was updated only once on November 5th, 2025, at 10:52:55. This update introduced a substantial React component responsible for displaying and managing merchant data. It includes features for editing various merchant attributes (comments, category, platform, etc.), pagination, and filtering capabilities. The component uses Ant Design and React Select for UI elements and manages data updates via functions like `updateMerchantByID` and `deletEntryForMerchant`.  The filtering functionality allows users to filter by various data fields including expected ARR using comparative operators.  The component also includes custom pagination controls.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/search/search.jsx` file was updated on 11/05/2025 at 11:14:10.  This React component (`Search`) implements a search functionality with filtering options.  The search uses `next/navigation` hooks for routing and URL parameter manipulation.  The component dynamically renders different search input fields (selects or text input) based on the selected filter.  Available filters depend on the user's role (`isAdmin`) and the current route (`path`).  The search functionality is debounced using `useDebouncedCallback` to prevent excessive updates.  The component uses Ant Design (`Button`, `EditOutlined`, `select`) for UI elements.  The search handles different search types ("cename", "merchantstate", "status", "mqm", "merchantname") and updates URL parameters accordingly.  The "status" filter conditionally displays an MQM (likely "Merchant Quality Metrics") select. The component receives `userData` and `targetdetails` props, presumably for populating select options.

The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/chart/piechart.jsx` between 14:30:02 and 14:59:43 on 11/05/2025.  These edits primarily focus on refining the `MerchantPieChart` component.  Initially, the component utilized `chart.js`, but it was later changed to use `recharts` for rendering the pie chart.  The changes involved restructuring the component to handle data aggregation and display more effectively.  The data is fetched from a `merchantData` prop, which may contain nested arrays (`smbData`, `entData`, `emergingData`). The component aggregates the `bookedArr` and `expectedArr` values for each `cename`.  A significant change was the introduction of an Ant Design `Select` component to allow users to choose between displaying "Booked ARR" and "Expected ARR" data.  The final version uses a state variable `allData` to store the raw aggregated data and `chartData` to hold the data formatted for the chart based on the user's selection.  The `handleSelectChange` function updates the `chartData` based on the selected value from the `Select` component.  There is a consistent pattern of using `parseFloat` to handle numerical data and error handling for cases where `merchantData` might be missing or incomplete.  The visual presentation of the chart also undergoes several iterations, primarily related to layout adjustments using Ant Design's `Row` and `Col` components for better responsiveness and styling. The final commit at 14:59:43 shows a correction in the `Select` component options to use consistent capitalization (`bookedArr` and `expectedArr`).


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/rightbar/rightbar.jsx` was modified once at 14:25:31 on 11/05/2025. This change introduced a `Rightbar` component that allows exporting merchant details to a CSV file.  The code handles data sanitization by removing specific keys (`createdAt`, `updateat`, `userId`, `id`) and cleaning up the `mintcomment` field before exporting.  The exported CSV file is named using the current date.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/navbar/navbar.jsx` was updated at 14:20:26 on 11/05/2025.  This commit added a `Navbar` component that displays a title derived from the current pathname and a menu section with a state selection dropdown and calendar input (`CalendarInput` component). The menu is conditionally rendered, appearing only when the current path is "/dashboard".

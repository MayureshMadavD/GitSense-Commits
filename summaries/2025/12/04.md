# Activity Summary for 04/12/2025

## 00:01:04
The provided log details a series of iterative changes across several UI components and utility files, primarily focusing on improving the "upsell" feature on a checkout dashboard and refining a rich text editor. The timestamps indicate a concentrated period of development activity on March 12, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**
    *   **03/12/2025, 20:34:11**: Introduced a null check (`if (!IdToRemove) return`) in the product removal logic within the "Applicable On" section's `ProductSearch` component to prevent errors with invalid IDs.
    *   **03/12/2025, 20:35:39**: Modified how the `items` prop is passed to the "Applicable On" `ProductSearch`, changing from `applicable_items` to the broader `upsellRules?.[index]`.
    *   **03/12/2025, 20:44:49**: Significantly refactored the `onRemove` callback in the "Applicable On" `ProductSearch` to use `form.setFieldsValue` for immutable state updates, ensuring a more consistent and robust way of removing selected products/collections.
    *   **03/12/2025, 20:51:29** and **03/12/2025, 21:01:13**: Implemented a cleaner method for handling `applicable_items` when switching radio options from 'all', using object destructuring (`const { all, ...restFields } = getAllFields || {}`) instead of `delete` to remove the 'all' property. A `console.log` statement was added at 20:51:29 for debugging and removed at 21:01:23.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:04:58**: Changed the default `selectedValue` for the `RichTextEditor` to an empty string (`''`) when the upsell rule title is missing, aligning with the editor's internal placeholder handling.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:07:18** and **03/12/2025, 21:07:32**: Added `max={100}` and `suffix='%'` to the "Discount Value" input field.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:11:39**: Temporarily changed the `RichTextEditor`'s `selectedValue` to a JSX placeholder, which was then reverted to an empty string at **03/12/2025, 21:12:18**.

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:15:44**: Added a top border (`border-t`) to the character count display.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:16:02**: Introduced conditional styling for the character count, making it red and bold (`text-red-500 font-semibold`) when approaching the `maxLength` (90% or more).
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:18:00**: Refined the `useEffect` hook for initializing editor content to prevent unnecessary updates and ensure the placeholder is correctly displayed when the `selectedValue` is empty. Also removed redundant `children` props from `Button` components in the toolbar.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:19:16**: Implemented `max-height` and `overflow-y-auto` for the editor `div`, along with `whitespace-pre-wrap` and `break-words` styles, to support longer content with scrolling and improved word wrapping.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:20:01**: Reordered the `useEffect` hook responsible for initializing content within the component, moving it to just before the return statement.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:21:06**: Changed the editor's `max-height` from a fixed value (`max-h-[300px]`) to `max-h-auto`.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:22:21**: Removed specific border styling (`border-solid border-gray-100`) from the editor's main content area.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:25:04**: Reinstated the `children` prop for `Button` components in the toolbar.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:28:13** and **03/12/2025, 21:29:24**: Added and then refined `e.stopPropagation()` in the `handleInputChange` function to better manage event propagation when the `maxLength` is exceeded.
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:38:14**: Added an `onKeyPress` event handler to the editor `div` to prevent further input when the `textCount` reaches `maxLength`.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
    *   **03/12/2025, 21:48:08**: Removed `CloseOutlined` from the UI kit imports.
    *   **03/12/2025, 22:13:44**: Made a cosmetic change by reordering props in the component definition.

4.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   No functional changes observed across the provided timestamps; the file consistently defines various API endpoints and helper functions for data fetching and updates related to products, collections, and upsell rules.

5.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   No functional changes observed across the provided timestamps; the file consistently defines API endpoint constants.

6.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts`**
    *   No functional changes observed across the provided timestamps; the file consistently provides various utility and helper functions.

7.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   No functional changes observed across the provided timestamps; the file continues to render a mobile UI preview based on Redux state, including elements like trust banners, offers, and upsell products.

8.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   No functional changes observed across the provided timestamps; the file consistently defines the Redux slice for UI customization data.

9.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**
    *   **03/12/2025, 22:42:43**: Simplified the label for upsell rules in the `Collapse` component, removing the `Alert` component.
    *   **03/12/2025, 22:51:33**: Added an `UpOutlined` icon button to each collapse rule's label, likely for visual interaction or reordering.
    *   **03/12/2025, 22:52:08** and **03/12/2025, 22:52:26**: Applied styling to the `UpOutlined` button (type `text`, `p-0 m-0` classes).
    *   **03/12/2025, 22:52:44**: Reduced spacing in the collapse item label (`gap-3` to `gap-1`) and added a `console.log(activeKey)` for debugging.
    *   **03/12/2025, 22:56:46** to **03/12/2025, 22:58:38**: Added advanced CSS classes (`group-hover:rotate-180`, `transition-transform duration-300`, `hover:bg-transparent`) to the `UpOutlined` button for enhanced hover and active animations. Changed button `type` to `link`.
    *   **03/12/2025, 23:03:49**: Restructured the form fields by moving the rendering of upsell rules and the "Add New Upsell Rule" button into a single `custom` field type.
    *   **03/12/2025, 23:05:15** to **03/12/2025, 23:06:28**: Experimented with setting `defaultActiveKey` on the `Collapse` component to control which rule is initially expanded, cycling through `[0]`, `0`, `[1]`, and finally removing the prop.
    *   **03/12/2025, 23:07:20**: Initialized the `activeKey` state with `['0']`, ensuring the first collapse item is expanded by default.
    *   **03/12/2025, 23:18:35**: Added debugging `console.log` and `return` statements within the delete modal's `onOk` handler, and refined the deletion logic for unsaved rules. These debugging statements were removed at **03/12/2025, 23:25:42**.
    *   **03/12/2025, 23:27:39** to **03/12/2025, 23:57:21**: Multiple attempts were made to correct the rule numbering logic displayed in the collapse item labels (e.g., `Rule {index + 1}`, `Rule {rules?.length === 0 ? index + 1 : index - 1}`). The final state seen in the log reverts to the most straightforward `Rule {index + 1}`, suggesting previous attempts to handle edge cases were overcomplicated or incorrect.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Continuous UI/UX Refinement:** There's a clear pattern of incremental improvements to existing components, particularly in styling, event handling, and data presentation. This includes adjusting margins, colors, animations, and how placeholders are managed.
*   **Form State Management:** Repeated modifications related to form data handling (`form.setFieldsValue`, `form.getFieldValue`, `useWatch`) indicate a focus on robust and efficient state management for complex forms, especially concerning nested data structures and immutable updates.
*   **Debugging and Iteration:** The frequent addition and removal of `console.log` statements, coupled with small, rapid changes to logic (e.g., rule numbering, `RichTextEditor` placeholder), highlight an iterative development process involving active debugging and refinement.
*   **Consistency in Imports:** Across the files, there's a consistent use of `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI components and `@library/utilities/api` for API interactions, demonstrating adherence to existing library structures.
*   **Upsell Feature Development:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around the upsell feature (`upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, `upsellCheckout.tsx`, Redux slice update), suggesting active development or refinement of this functionality, including rule definition, display, and persistence.

## 00:38:44
The changes primarily revolve around implementing and refining a KwikPass checkout flow within an Expo-based application, likely integrating with Shopify.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/.env`**:
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 17:45:53):** The `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPMAKER_PROJECT_ID` was set to `194419` for "the derma co.". Other project IDs were commented out. `EXPO_PUBLIC_DISABLE_SHOPIFY_API_DEPRECATION_WARNING` was set to `true`.
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 23:41:49):** The active `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPMAKER_PROJECT_ID` changed to `183929` for "sandbox-plus", with the previous `194419` commented out.
    *   **Timestamp (28/11/2025, 00:21:22):** The active `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPMAKER_PROJECT_ID` reverted to `194419` for "the derma co.".
    *   **Timestamp (28/11/2025, 17:07:40):** The active `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPMAKER_PROJECT_ID` changed back to `183929` for "sandbox-plus".
    *   **Timestamp (01/12/2025, 18:01:49):** The active `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPMAKER_PROJECT_ID` reverted to `194419` for "the derma co.".
    *   **Pattern:** Frequent switching of the `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPMAKER_PROJECT_ID` between different project IDs (specifically `183929` and `194419`), suggesting testing or environment configuration changes.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` (and its counterpart in `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`)**: This file is central to the KwikPass checkout integration, handling events from the WebView.
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 18:51:28 - 27/11/2025, 18:52:00):** Initial code sets up `KwikPassCheckout` component, imports necessary modules, defines `extractId` for Shopify GID, and contains an `onEvent` handler for `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable` events from a `gokwikSdk`. The `orderSuccess` handler attempts to extract `orderID` and `orderKey` from the `checkoutUrl` and `orderGID`, and then conditionally performs `KWIKPASS_LOGIN`.
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 22:53:59):** Added a `console.log(matches, "=== Matches for order key ===") ` within the `orderSuccess` case to debug regex matching.
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 22:55:29 - 27/11/2025, 22:55:45):** Minor formatting changes, such as adding semicolons and adjusting console logs for clarity. The regex for `orderKey` extraction appears to have a subtle issue (`matches[1]` without defining `matches` within the scope of the `if (matches)` block).
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 22:59:03 - 27/11/2025, 23:06:37):** Multiple iterations where `console.log` statements are added or modified within the `orderSuccess` case to trace the extraction of `orderId` and `orderKey` more thoroughly, specifically adding messages like `"checkoutURL Is Coming"`, `"orderId Is Coming"`, `"Coming Inside the condition yes yes"` and for different steps of regex matching. The `orderKey` variable is still incorrectly referencing an undeclared `matches` variable in later updates, indicating a potential bug.
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 23:16:36 - 27/11/2025, 23:16:45):** Introduced an additional regex `orderKeyRegexExtra = /\/orders\/([^/?#]+)/` to try and extract the `orderKey`, suggesting the initial `orderKeyRegex` might not have been robust enough. The `matches` variable is now correctly assigned using an OR condition for the two regexes. A `console.log("ORDER KEY MATCHES", matches)` was added.
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 23:30:22):** A significant refactor of the `orderSuccess` handler. It introduces a structured approach:
        1.  Extracts Shopify Order ID (from GraphQL GID only).
        2.  Redirects the customer to GoKwik's official `checkoutUrl` using `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action, explicitly noting to *not* extract the key manually or rebuild Shopify URLs. This change removes the logic attempting to extract `orderKey` and `orderId` to call `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` with them.
        3.  Implements auto-login using GoKwik token if the user is not already logged in. This update significantly simplifies the order completion logic within the app by deferring to GoKwik's `checkoutUrl` for the final state.
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 23:50:11):** This update seems to revert the structured `orderSuccess` handler back to a state similar to before the 23:30:22 change, reintroducing the `orderKeyRegex`, `orderKeyRegexExtra`, and `matches` logic, and the `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action with `orderID` and `orderKey`. This suggests the previous refactor was either reverted or temporarily put aside.
    *   **Timestamp (28/11/2025, 00:25:40):** Added logic to prefix `checkoutUrl` with `https://` if it doesn't already start with `http://` or `https://`. This is a URL validation/correction.
    *   **Timestamp (28/11/2025, 00:44:33 - 28/11/2025, 07:55:36):** Further refinements to the `checkoutUrl` prefixing logic, ensuring it handles cases where `checkoutUrl` might initially be null. The `orderKeyRegexExtra` is removed, and the `matches` assignment is back to using only `orderKeyRegex`. The logging of `ORDER KEY MATCHES` is present.
    *   **Timestamp (28/11/2025, 11:09:45 - 28/11/2025, 11:13:51):** Modifies the `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action parameters, specifically `orderKey:orderKey || ''`, indicating that `orderKey` might sometimes be undefined, and a fallback to an empty string is added. The `orderKeyRegexExtra` is re-introduced, then removed again in subsequent updates.
    *   **Timestamp (28/11/2025, 12:25:54 - 28/11/2025, 12:41:56):** Significant changes in `orderSuccess` logic:
        *   The explicit extraction of `orderKey` and `checkoutUrl` usage to pass to `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` is progressively removed.
        *   Instead, an `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action is introduced to navigate to a generic Shopify thank you page constructed with `order_id` (e.g., `https://your-shop.myshopify.com/thank_you?order_id=${orderId}`). This implies a shift towards a more standard Shopify post-checkout flow rather than relying on GoKwik's `checkoutUrl` for the final confirmation within the app.
        *   The `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action is still called, but `orderKey` is often passed as an empty string or removed from the parameters.
        *   New logic added (Timestamp 28/11/2025, 12:41:56) where `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` is conditional: if `orderKey` is not present, it navigates to the `checkoutUrl` provided by GoKwik; otherwise, it only calls `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`.
    *   **Timestamp (28/11/2025, 17:10:35 - 01/12/2025, 18:04:25):** The file reverts to a state similar to the initial changes, where both `checkoutUrl` and `orderGID` are used to extract `orderId` and `orderKey`, and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` is called with both. A `console.log(message?.eventname,"Event Name and Data")` is added. A temporary block was added (and then commented out) to count 'gokwik_events', indicating debugging for specific GoKwik event tracking.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx`**:
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 18:54:00):** This file defines the `KPCheckout` component, acting as a wrapper for the `Checkout` component. It logs `checkoutData` and passes various merchant parameters to `Checkout`. No significant logic changes are observed in this file across the provided logs.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx`**: This file contains the WebView component and its core logic for handling GoKwik.
    *   **Timestamp (27/11/2025, 18:57:26 - 27/11/2025, 20:35:26):** Consistent `injectJavaScript` string is used to set up event listeners within the WebView for `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gokwik_events`, and `gk-checkout-disable`. It includes logic for initiating checkout (custom or Shopify), handling `AppState` and `BackHandler`, and contains UPI payment intent handling with `showAlert` and `convertToIntentUrl` functions. The content remains largely stable across these timestamps. No discernible changes in the provided log snippets for this file.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/pages/CheckoutOptions.js`**:
    *   **Timestamp (28/11/2025, 14:48:50 - 28/11/2025, 14:52:20):** This file defines a `CheckoutOptions` page with a single block, `kwikpass/checkout`, indicating that this page is specifically designed to render the KwikPass checkout component. No functional changes are observed.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **KwikPass/GoKwik Integration:** The entire log revolves around the integration of "KwikPass" and "GoKwik" checkout functionalities within an Expo React Native application. This involves a `KPCheckout` component and a `WebView` interacting with a `gokwikSdk`.
2.  **Event Handling from WebView:** A crucial part of the logic is the `onEvent` callback in `KwikPassCheckout.js` which listens to specific events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gk-checkout-disable`) posted from the WebView's JavaScript context (defined in `Checkout.tsx`'s `injectJavaScript`).
3.  **Order Success Processing:** The `orderSuccess` event handling is the most frequently modified section. It consistently attempts to:
    *   Log `checkoutURL` and `orderGID`.
    *   Extract `orderID` from `graphqlOrderId`.
    *   Attempt to extract `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl` using regex (with variations in regexes over time).
    *   Perform a `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` if the user is not already logged in.
    *   Call `props.onAction` with `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` and `orderID`/`orderKey`.
    *   There was a brief attempt to use `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` to redirect to the raw `checkoutUrl` or a constructed Shopify thank you page, which was later reverted or refined back to extracting `orderKey` for `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`.
4.  **Debugging:** Frequent addition and modification of `console.log` statements throughout the `KwikPassCheckout.js` file, especially in the `orderSuccess` handler, indicate ongoing debugging efforts to correctly parse and handle order details from GoKwik.
5.  **Environment Variable Toggling:** The `.env` file shows repeated changes in the `EXPO_PUBLIC_APPMAKER_PROJECT_ID` between different values (`183929` for sandbox-plus and `194419` for "the derma co."), suggesting active testing across different client configurations or environments.
6.  **Shopify Integration:** The use of `useShopifyAccessToken`, extraction of `gid://shopify/Shop/(\d+)`, and actions like `OPEN_SHOPIFY_NATIVE_CHECKOUT` and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` clearly point to a Shopify backend integration.
7.  **URL Handling:** Logic to ensure `checkoutUrl` starts with `https://` (or `http://`) was added, and handling for `openInBrowserTab` differentiates between standard URLs and custom URL schemes.

## 01:00:55
**File-specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx**
    *   **Timestamp:** The earliest significant change was at `03/12/2025, 21:42:08`, followed by intermittent minor updates until `03/12/2025, 22:24:04`.
    *   **Content:** This React component for product and collection search underwent minor refactorings. Imports of `CloseOutlined` were repeatedly added and removed, suggesting UI component experimentation or cleanup. A minor whitespace adjustment was made to the `btnSearch` prop's type definition at `21:49:43`. The most notable structural change occurred at `22:13:44`, where the order of props (`topUpGift`, `btnSearch`) in the component signature and its type definition was adjusted. The core functionality, including filtering by `no-agent` tags, pagination, and product/variant aggregation, remained consistent.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts**
    *   **Timestamp:** This file remained stable across its recorded timestamps (`03/12/2025, 21:43:30` to `03/12/2025, 22:27:47`).
    *   **Content:** This utility file handles various API calls related to Shopify products/collections, merchant data, upsell configurations, and GST validation. No functional code changes were observed in the provided logs. It continues to utilize a shared `makeAPICall` function and references external API endpoint definitions.

    *   **Timestamp:** This file showed no changes across its recorded timestamps (`03/12/2025, 21:43:40` to `03/12/2025, 22:25:27`).
    *   **Content:** This file serves as a central repository for numerous API endpoint paths within the dashboard, covering areas such as orders, customer management, pincode services, product/collection data, analytics, and discount configurations, including specific upsell-related endpoints.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts**
    *   **Timestamp:** This file remained unchanged across its recorded timestamps (`03/12/2025, 21:44:31` to `03/12/2025, 22:15:51`).
    *   **Content:** This file contains a suite of general utility functions, including dynamic search filter generation, date and currency formatting, object comparison, debouncing, date/time picker logic, string capitalization, and CSV upload validation. It also includes the `validateUpsellRules` function, which is later used in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file was introduced and remained stable at `03/12/2025, 21:45:30`.
    *   **Content:** This React component (`MobileStepUI`) provides a preview interface for mobile UI customizations. It dynamically displays content related to brand, login, payments, checkout elements, address, and coupons, fetching data from the Redux store, including upsell product lists and trust banners.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts**
    *   **Timestamp:** The file was introduced and remained stable across its recorded timestamps (`03/12/2025, 21:45:59` to `03/12/2025, 22:16:18`).
    *   **Content:** This Redux Toolkit slice (`bannerSlice`) manages the state for various UI customization settings such as brand, login, address, payment, and upsell data, providing reducers to update these configurations.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx**
    *   **Timestamp:** This file saw extensive, frequent changes from `03/12/2025, 22:41:31` extending into `04/12/2025, 00:57:43`.
    *   **Content:** This component, `UpsellForCheckout`, is responsible for configuring upsell rules for the checkout process.
        *   **UI Refinements (Labels & Icons):** There was a prolonged series of minor UI adjustments to the labels and icons within the collapse items. This involved removing an `Alert` component, adding and repeatedly styling/removing an `UpOutlined` button, and experimenting with various conditional logic for displaying rule numbers, eventually reverting to a consistent "Rule {index + 1}" text with no icon in the label by `00:57:43`.
        *   **Form Structure Change:** At `03/12/2025, 23:03:49`, the dynamic rendering of upsell rules and the "Add New Upsell Rule" button were refactored into a `custom` render field within the main `Form`'s `fields` array, integrating dynamic sections more tightly into the form's controlled state.
        *   **Conditional Visibility:** A significant functional change between `04/12/2025, 00:40:54` and `00:50:49` introduced `hidden:!upsellEnabled` to several form fields. This makes the "Cap Quantity for Each Upsell SKU" label and input, the divider, and the entire section for displaying and adding upsell rules (including the collapse items) conditionally visible based on whether the main "Cart Upsell" switch is enabled.
        *   **Dynamic Active Key Management:** Several attempts were made to control the `activeKey` state for the `Collapse` component, aiming to auto-open the last added rule or maintain active states dynamically (e.g., `00:03:41`, `00:34:39`, `00:40:34`), often introducing and then correcting problematic logic.
        *   **Debugging:** The presence of `console.log` statements and recurring fixes to the logic within the modal's `onOk` handler (e.g., `23:18:35`, `23:25:42`, `23:26:21`) suggest intensive debugging, especially concerning the deletion of unsaved rules.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Intense Development Cycle:** All changes occurred within a short, concentrated timeframe across two days (`03/12/2025` and `04/12/2025`), indicating active development, iterative UI/UX refinement, and debugging.
*   **UI/UX Refinement:** A strong pattern of fine-tuning the user interface, particularly in `upsellCheckout.tsx`, is evident through repeated changes to labels, icons, and conditional rendering of form elements. This suggests a focus on creating a clear and intuitive user experience for complex configurations.
*   **Dynamic Form Management:** The use of Ant Design's `Form` and `Collapse` components, combined with dynamic state management (`useState`, Redux `dispatch`), is a recurring theme, especially in `upsellCheckout.tsx`, to handle user-configurable lists of rules and their associated properties.
*   **API and State Management Integration:** Components frequently interact with a centralized `api.ts` for data operations and a Redux store (`customize-ui/index.ts`) for managing UI-related state, demonstrating a consistent application architecture.
*   **Debugging Process:** The numerous temporary `console.log` statements and the iterative correction of logic (especially in `upsellCheckout.tsx`'s delete modal) highlight a practical, trial-and-error approach during development.

The provided log details changes primarily within a React Native application related to a KwikPass/GoKwik checkout integration, with modifications across several JavaScript and TypeScript files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`** and **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`** (two parallel paths for potentially the same component):
    *   **Initial Setup (27/11/2025, 18:51:28)**: Defines the core `KwikPassCheckout` React component, which acts as an `onEvent` callback handler for messages from a WebView. It includes a `switch` statement to process various events from the GoKwik SDK, such as `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable`. It integrates with `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package`, `@appmaker-xyz/core` (for analytics and storage), and `@appmaker-xyz/shopify` (for access tokens). The `orderSuccess` handler extracts `orderID` and `orderKey` from Shopify GID and checkout URLs, triggering a `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action and conditionally a `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` action.
    *   **Debugging & Bug Introductions/Fixes (27/11/2025, 22:53:59 - 28/11/2025, 07:55:36)**:
        *   Minor debugging `console.log` statements were frequently added and modified, often to trace the values of `orderKey` matches, `checkoutURL`, and `orderId`.
        *   A bug was introduced (27/11/2025, 22:55:29) where the `orderKey` extraction logic was removed, and then fixed/re-introduced with more robust regex (`orderKeyRegexExtra`) (27/11/2025, 23:16:36).
        *   The condition for processing `orderSuccess` was briefly simplified from `if (checkoutUrl && orderGID)` to `if (checkoutUrl)` (27/11/2025, 23:03:24), then reverted.
        *   URL prefixing logic was added for `checkoutUrl` to ensure it starts with `https://` (28/11/2025, 00:25:40), and this logic underwent several refinements and corrections for potential bugs in its implementation (e.g., initializing `checkoutUrl` to `null` before checking its prefix).
    *   **Major Refactor and Reversion (27/11/2025, 23:30:22 - 27/11/2025, 23:50:11)**:
        *   A significant refactoring (27/11/2025, 23:30:22) in the `orderSuccess` handler removed `orderKey` extraction, commented out `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`, and changed redirection to directly open the `checkoutUrl` via `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` with clearer comments. This refactoring was almost immediately reverted (27/11/2025, 23:50:11), restoring the previous `orderKey` extraction and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` logic.
    *   **Further `orderSuccess` Iterations (28/11/2025, 12:25:54 - 28/11/2025, 12:41:56)**:
        *   The `orderSuccess` handling saw more complex changes: `orderKey` extraction was again commented out, and a manual Shopify thank you page URL was constructed for `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` (28/11/2025, 12:25:54).
        *   This was followed by corrections to the conditional logic and re-introduction of `checkoutUrl` for redirection (28/11/2025, 12:37:42).
        *   Finally, the `orderKey` extraction was fully restored and passed to `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`, and the `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action became conditional on whether `orderKey` was found (28/11/2025, 12:41:56).
    *   **Temporary Debugging (01/12/2025, 17:55:47 - 01/12/2025, 18:02:38)**: Temporary debugging code for `gokwik_events` (including a `count` variable) was added, fixed for a typo, and then commented out.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (27/11/2025, 18:54:00)**: Defines the `KPCheckout` component, which serves as a wrapper to pass `checkoutData` and event handlers (`onEvent`, `onError`, `onNavigationStateChange`) to the underlying `Checkout` component. It logs the `checkoutData` during rendering.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (27/11/2025, 18:57:26)**: Implements the core `Checkout` component using `react-native-webview`. It defines `injectJavaScript` to be run inside the WebView, which sets up listeners for `gokwikSdk` events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gokwik_events`, `gk-checkout-disable`) and posts them back to the native app via `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage`. It handles deep linking for UPI apps, constructs the WebView URL based on merchant type (Shopify or custom), and encodes `storeInfo` and GoKwik tokens using `base64`. It also includes handlers for app state changes and hardware back button presses.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/pages/CheckoutOptions.js`**:
    *   **Initial Setup (28/11/2025, 14:48:50)**: Defines a simple page configuration object named `CheckoutOptions`, containing a single block that references `kwikpass/checkout` with specific UI attributes like `insideSafeAreaView`, `headerShown`, and `backgroundColor`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/11/2025, 18:51:28**: Core `KwikPassCheckout.js` component implementation.
*   **27/11/2025, 18:57:26**: Core `Checkout.tsx` WebView integration with injected JavaScript and UPI handling.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:16:36**: `orderKey` extraction logic was significantly improved and stabilized in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:30:22**: A major structural change to `orderSuccess` handling, which was subsequently reverted.
*   **28/11/2025, 00:25:40**: Introduction of `https://` prefixing for checkout URLs.
*   **28/11/2025, 07:48:18**: Fixes to the `https://` prefixing logic for `checkoutUrl`.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:25:54**: Introduction of a manual Shopify thank you page redirection attempt, marking a temporary shift in `orderSuccess` handling strategy.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:41:56**: Refined `orderSuccess` handling, restoring robust `orderKey` extraction and conditional navigation.
*   **28/11/2025, 14:48:50**: `CheckoutOptions` page configuration defined.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging**: There's a clear pattern of continuous refinement, bug introduction, and subsequent fixes, particularly within the `orderSuccess` event handler in `KwikPassCheckout.js`. This is often accompanied by the addition and removal of `console.log` statements.
*   **Dual File Paths**: The existence and simultaneous modification of `KwikPassCheckout.js` in both `packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/` and `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/` suggests either a development setup involving duplicated code that needs to be manually synced or a refactoring process that led to temporary parallel files.
*   **GoKwik SDK Integration**: The core functionality revolves around handling events from the `gokwikSdk` within a WebView, indicating a robust integration strategy using message passing between web content and the native application.
*   **Shopify Integration Focus**: Many actions and data manipulations (e.g., `extractId`, `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`, `KWIKPASS_LOGIN`) are specifically tailored to Shopify's GraphQL GIDs and authentication mechanisms, highlighting a strong focus on the Shopify ecosystem.
*   **URL Handling**: Repeated efforts are made to correctly extract information from URLs using regular expressions and to ensure URLs are properly formatted (e.g., `https://` prefixing) before use in navigation or actions.
*   **State Management and Actions**: The components frequently interact with an `appStorageApi` for user data and dispatch actions (`props?.onAction`) for navigation, order completion, and login, demonstrating a structured approach to app flow.

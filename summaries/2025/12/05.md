# Activity Summary for 05/12/2025

## 11:04:32
**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**

*   **Initial State (03/12/2025, 22:57:29):** The component `UpsellForCheckout` is responsible for managing upsell rules within a checkout dashboard. It uses a form, API calls (`getAndDeleteUpsellData`, `pushUpsellData`) to fetch and save upsell configurations, and Redux (`updateUpsellState`) to manage UI state. It features collapsible items for individual upsell rules with edit/delete actions and supports drag-and-drop reordering.
*   **Styling and UI Refinements (03/12/2025, 22:58:38 - 03/12/2025, 23:06:28):** Minor cosmetic changes were applied to a button within the collapse item's label, including adding `hover:bg-transparent` and changing its `type` from `'text'` to `'link'`. The `defaultActiveKey` property for the `Collapse` component was experimented with (`[0]`, `[1]`, then removed). A significant structural change involved moving the rendering of the dynamic upsell rule collapse items into a `custom` field within the main `fields` array, standardizing its rendering via `RenderField`.
*   **Debugging and Deletion Logic (03/12/2025, 23:06:58 - 03/12/2025, 23:29:11):** Debugging statements (`console.log`) were added around the `activeKey` state and within the `Modal`'s `onOk` handler for deleting rules. The deletion logic for newly added rules (without an existing ID) was iteratively refined, involving `splice` operations on the form's `upsell_rules` array and updating `upsellItems` state.
*   **Rule Labeling and Keying Adjustments (03/12/2025, 23:48:59 - 04/12/2025, 00:03:41):** There were numerous attempts to adjust the display of "Rule {index + 1}" within the collapse item labels, often resulting in incorrect or inconsistent numbering (`rules.length - 1`, `index - 1`, `rules?.length || 0`, etc.). Similarly, the `key` property for the rendered `Collapse` items was frequently modified between `index`, `index + 1`, `index - 1`, and `rules?.length`, indicating a struggle with stable key generation for dynamic lists. Ultimately, the rule label was reverted to the original `index + 1`, and the `key` reverted to `index`.
*   **Active Key Management and Memoization (04/12/2025, 00:34:33 - 04/12/2025, 00:43:23):** Logic was added to `buildUpsellCollapse` to automatically set the `activeKey` of the collapse component (e.g., to expand the last rule). A `useMemo` hook was briefly introduced then removed for `collapseItems`, suggesting experimentation with performance optimization for the dynamically generated list.
*   **Conditional Visibility of Upsell Configuration (04/12/2025, 00:48:47 - 04/12/2025, 00:50:49):** A new `upsellEnabled` variable, derived from `Form.useWatch(['cart_upsell', 'enabled'], form)`, was introduced. This variable is used to conditionally hide or show various upsell configuration fields (like "Cap Quantity for Each Upsell SKU" and the rule management section) using the `hidden` prop in `RenderField`.
*   **Enhanced Rule Display and UI Structure (04/12/2025, 00:53:50 - 04/12/2025, 00:57:43):** The display of rule labels was significantly updated to prioritize showing `rule?.title` if available, falling back to "Text to be updated", and then displaying "Rule {index + 1}" within an `Alert` component. The `UpOutlined` button, which previously acted as an expand/collapse icon, was removed from the label itself, relying on the default collapse behavior. `setActiveKey([String(upsellItems.length)])` was re-added to the "Add New Upsell Rule" button's `onClick` to auto-expand new rules.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**

*   **Integration with Upsell Data (04/12/2025, 01:00:41):** The `MobileStepUI` component was updated to conditionally retrieve `listOfProducts` from `customizeUiData?.upsell_data?.upsell_product_list?.products?.data` when `isUpsellCall` is true. This suggests an integration to display upsell products within the mobile preview.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**

*   **Placeholder and Validation Message Refinements (04/12/2025, 01:05:27 - 04/12/2025, 01:10:35):** The default `placeholder` prop for the `RichTextEditor` was changed to an empty string. The positioning and conditional rendering of the "Field cannot be empty." validation message were adjusted multiple times, moving it above the character count and ensuring it renders an empty `div` when not active to maintain layout.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**

*   **Discounted Price Logic (04/12/2025, 22:18:10 - 04/12/2025, 22:20:50):** Initial logic for `UpsellFormRendererComponent` includes fields for defining individual upsell rules. An `onChange` handler was added to the "Configure upsell items on discount price" `Checkbox`. This handler now conditionally sets `discount.value` and `discount.capping` to 0 when the checkbox is unchecked, ensuring discount fields are cleared if the feature is disabled.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI/UX Iteration:** There's a clear pattern of iterative changes, particularly in `upsellCheckout.tsx`, to refine UI behavior, such as rule numbering, active panel management, and conditional rendering based on feature toggles. This often involved multiple small adjustments and reversions, suggesting an active development and testing cycle.
*   **Debugging Practices:** Frequent addition and removal of `console.log` statements highlight a process of debugging and understanding component state and logic flow, especially in areas like item deletion and dynamic indexing.
*   **Feature-driven Conditional Rendering:** The introduction of `Form.useWatch` and `hidden` props for conditional rendering based on the "Cart Upsell" toggle indicates a robust approach to managing complex forms and ensuring relevant fields are only visible when the main feature is enabled.
*   **State Management and API Interaction:** Components consistently utilize React's `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, and `useCallback`/`useMemo` hooks, along with Redux (`useDispatch`, `updateUpsellState`) and custom API hooks (`useMerchantConfigApi`, `getAndDeleteUpsellData`, `pushUpsellData`, `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId`), to manage local and global state, interact with backend services, and optimize performance.
*   **Form Management:** Ant Design's `Form` component and `Form.useWatch` are heavily used for managing complex form states, including dynamic rule arrays, input validation, and conditional logic.

## 11:56:49
The log details changes across two distinct areas: Android SDK configuration and a React Native application's checkout logic.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/android/local.properties**:
    *   Initially, the `sdk.dir` property was set to `/Users/mac/Library/Android/sdk` at **04/12/2025, 15:06:18**.
    *   This was quickly updated to `sdk.dir=/Users/mayuresh.madav/Library/Android/sdk` at **04/12/2025, 15:06:37**. This change indicates an adjustment to the local Android SDK path, likely to match the specific developer's environment.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/src/screens/app/Checkout.tsx**:
    *   At **04/12/2025, 15:23:24**, a new `Checkout` React Native component was implemented.
    *   This component integrates the `KPCheckout` module and includes handlers for various checkout events:
        *   `handleEvent`: Manages different `message.eventname` types.
            *   Displays an `Alert` for `checkout-initiation-failure`.
            *   On `orderSuccess`, it conditionally calls `getCheckoutMultiPassToken` with user details (phone, email) and an access token, then logs the response.
            *   Triggers `navigation.goBack()` for `order-complete`, `modal_closed`, `checkout-close`, and `orderSuccess` events.
        *   `handleError`: Logs any errors encountered during the checkout process.
        *   `handleNavigationState`: Logs navigation state changes within the `WebView` used by `KPCheckout`.
    *   The `KPCheckout` component is rendered with specific `checkoutData` including a `cartId` and connects the defined event, error, and navigation state handlers.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The rapid succession of updates to `local.properties` (within 19 seconds) on **04/12/2025, 15:06:18** and **15:06:37** indicates an immediate configuration correction.
*   The comprehensive implementation of the `Checkout.tsx` component occurred roughly 17 minutes later at **04/12/2025, 15:23:24**, suggesting that environment setup preceded feature development.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   The `local.properties` changes show a pattern of adjusting an `sdk.dir` path for a specific user.
*   In `Checkout.tsx`, there's a recurring pattern of `console.log` statements used for debugging purposes across various events, errors, and navigation states, indicating a focus on observability during development.
*   Multiple `message.eventname` values are handled within a single `handleEvent` function, showcasing a centralized event processing strategy for the checkout flow.

## 11:57:31
The code changes primarily focus on refining the integration and event handling for the GoKwik checkout process within an Appmaker-based Expo application. The period of changes, November 27-28, 2025, and December 01, 2025, shows a rapid iteration and debugging phase.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` (and its mirrored path `/src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`)**
    *   **Timestamp 27/11/2025, 18:51:28**: The initial core logic for `KwikPassCheckout` component was established. This component acts as the main handler for GoKwik checkout events received from a WebView. Key functionalities include:
        *   Tracking analytics for all received events (`analytics.track`).
        *   Handling `modal_closed` by navigating back (`GO_BACK`).
        *   Processing `orderSuccess` to extract `checkoutUrl`, `graphqlOrderId` (GID), and potentially an `orderKey` (using regex patterns), then calling `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` and attempting KwikPass user login (`KWIKPASS_LOGIN`) if the user is not already logged in.
        *   Managing `openInBrowserTab` by directing the URL to either an `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action or letting `webViewCanHandleCurrentUrl` handle custom schemes.
        *   Responding to `gk-checkout-disable` by triggering an `OPEN_SHOPIFY_NATIVE_CHECKOUT` action.
        *   `handleNavigationState` directs to home if the URL signifies the homepage.
    *   **Significant Refactoring and Reversions for `orderSuccess` (27/11/2025, 23:30:22 - 28/11/2025, 12:41:56)**:
        *   A major refactoring (27/11/2025, 23:30:22) simplified `orderSuccess` by explicitly stating *not* to manually extract `orderKey` and instead to `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` the `checkoutUrl` provided by GoKwik. It aimed to extract only the Shopify `orderId` from the GraphQL GID.
        *   This refactoring was quickly **reverted** (27/11/2025, 23:50:11), bringing back the manual `orderKey` extraction and the `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action.
        *   Subsequent changes focused on enhancing the robustness of `checkoutUrl` handling, including prefixing `https://` if a scheme was missing (28/11/2025, 00:25:40, 28/11/2025, 07:48:18, 28/11/2025, 07:55:12, 28/11/2025, 12:38:59).
        *   The logic for setting `ORDER_COMPLETE` and potentially opening the `checkoutUrl` in a WebView became more conditional and complex, attempting to handle scenarios where `orderKey` might be missing (28/11/2025, 12:25:54, 28/11/2025, 12:41:56). Initially, `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` was even temporarily commented out (28/11/2025, 12:29:10).
    *   **Debugging Activity (Multiple timestamps)**: Numerous `console.log` statements were added, modified, and removed throughout the `onEvent` and especially `orderSuccess` block, indicating an active debugging phase to understand data flow and regex matching (e.g., 27/11/2025, 22:53:59; 27/11/2025, 23:00:27; 27/11/2025, 23:06:15; 28/11/2025, 17:10:35; 01/12/2025, 17:55:47). A specific debugging block for `gokwik_events` was added, corrected (due to a typo `eventnamer`), and then commented out (01/12/2025, 17:55:47 to 01/12/2025, 18:02:38).

*   **`/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 27/11/2025, 18:54:00**: This file defines the `KPCheckout` React component, which serves as a wrapper. It primarily passes `checkoutData` (containing `merchantParams` like `cartId`, `storefrontToken`, `storeId`, `sessionId`, `utmParams`, `fbpixel`, `gaTrackingID`, `webEngageID`, `moEngageID`, `orderTags`) to an internal `Checkout` component and relays `onEvent`, `onError`, `onNavigationStateChange` callbacks.

*   **`/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp 27/11/2025, 18:57:26**: This file contains the React Native WebView implementation for the GoKwik checkout. It includes:
        *   Injected JavaScript (`injectJavaScript`) to listen for `gokwikSdk` events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gk-checkout-disable`) within the WebView and post them back to the React Native app.
        *   Platform-specific handling for UPI apps (`UPI_APP_PACKAGES`, `convertToIntentUrl`, `handlePaymentIntent`).
        *   Dynamic construction of the WebView URL (`InitiateCheckout`), fetching merchant information, environment details, and user data from `CacheInstance`, and encoding sensitive `storeInfo` and `gkToken` using Base64.
        *   Integration with React Native's `BackHandler` and `AppState` to communicate state changes to the WebView.
    *   **Consistent Content**: Despite multiple timestamps (e.g., 27/11/2025, 18:59:47; 27/11/2025, 20:20:11; 27/11/2025, 20:35:26), the core logic in this file remained stable, suggesting that the development efforts were focused on the `KwikPassCheckout.js` component, which integrates this lower-level `KPCheckout` component.

*   **`/packages/kwikpassV2/src/pages/CheckoutOptions.js`**
    *   **Timestamp 28/11/2025, 14:48:50**: This file defines a page configuration object `CheckoutOptions` that includes the `kwikpass/checkout` block, indicating where the `KwikPassCheckout` component is intended to be used within the application's page structure.
    *   **Consistent Content**: The content is identical across two timestamps (28/11/2025, 14:48:50 and 28/11/2025, 14:52:20).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dual File Paths**: The existence and repeated updates to `KwikPassCheckout.js` in both `/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/` and `/src/kwikpassV2/src/components/` indicates either a complex build setup, an ongoing refactoring/migration of modules, or potentially an inconsistency in the development environment causing duplicate changes to be logged.
*   **GoKwik SDK Integration**: A strong focus on integrating the GoKwik SDK for checkout, specifically handling success, failure, and navigation events from its WebView.
*   **Shopify Integration**: The code actively interacts with Shopify-specific IDs (GraphQL GID) and constructs URLs for Shopify's thank-you page. Access tokens (`shopifyAccessToken`, `gk_access_token`) are used for authentication and API calls.
*   **User Login Flow**: There's a consistent attempt to auto-login users via KwikPass (`KWIKPASS_LOGIN`) after a successful order if they are not already logged in, using `email` and `gkAccessToken` received from the `orderSuccess` event.
*   **WebView Communication Pattern**: `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage` is the recurring pattern for event communication from the WebView to the native React Native application.
*   **Debugging-Heavy Development**: The frequent addition and removal of `console.log` statements suggest an iterative debugging process, particularly around the crucial `orderSuccess` flow.
*   **Checkout URL Handling**: Repeated adjustments to ensure `checkoutUrl` is correctly formed with `https://` prefix, reflecting potential issues with inconsistent URL formats from the GoKwik SDK.
*   **Order ID/Key Extraction Challenges**: The `orderSuccess` event handler in `KwikPassCheckout.js` shows repeated attempts and changes in strategy for parsing `orderId` from GraphQL GID and `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl` regex, highlighting the complexity and potential fragility of this extraction.

## 12:05:22
The log details changes across multiple files, primarily focusing on the upsell configuration functionality within a checkout dashboard UI.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx` (03/12/2025, 22:57:29 - 04/12/2025, 11:37:15):** This file underwent the most frequent changes, reflecting active development and debugging of the upsell rule configuration interface.
    *   **UI/Styling Refinements:** Initial changes involved minor adjustments to button types (`type='text'` to `type='link'`) and CSS classes (`hover:bg-transparent`) for consistency and appearance within the collapsible rule panels.
    *   **Collapse Panel Management:** There were numerous iterative changes and reversions related to managing the `activeKey` state for `Collapse` components. This included attempts to set `defaultActiveKey` to specific indices, and later, logic to automatically expand newly added rules by setting `activeKey` to the index of the last rule. The `key` prop for `Collapse` items also saw several experimental changes (e.g., `index + 1`, `index - 1`, `rules.length`) before eventually stabilizing on `index`.
    *   **Structural Layout Adjustments:** The rendering of the dynamic upsell rule items and the "Add New Upsell Rule" button was repeatedly moved between being directly placed in the `Card` component and being encapsulated within a `type: 'custom'` field managed by `RenderField`. The final state places the "Add New Upsell Rule" button before the list of upsell items.
    *   **Rule Label Enhancement:** The display of the rule label in the collapse panel was significantly improved. Instead of a simple "Rule {index + 1}", it now dynamically displays the rule's `title` (if available) using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, falls back to "Text to be updated", and also includes an `Alert` component showing "Rule {index + 1}". The `UpOutlined` icon button was removed from the label itself.
    *   **Conditional Visibility:** A major functional update introduced `Form.useWatch` to monitor the 'Cart Upsell' toggle (`cart_upsell.enabled`). Various upsell-related form fields (divider, 'Cap Quantity' label and input, and the entire section for listing/adding rules) are now dynamically hidden when the 'Cart Upsell' feature is disabled (`hidden: !upsellEnabled`).
    *   **Debugging:** Several `console.log` statements were temporarily added and removed across different timestamps to inspect state variables like `activeKey`, `isModalOpen`, `upsellRules`, and `upsellEnabled` during development.
    *   **Delete Modal Logic:** The logic within the delete confirmation modal's `onOk` handler was adjusted for correctness, ensuring `form.setFieldsValue` uses the appropriately filtered `upsellRules` after a rule is removed.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx` (04/12/2025, 01:00:41):** This file provides a mobile preview interface. It leverages Redux state (`customizeUiData`) to render different sections of the checkout UI (brand, login, payments, checkout elements, coupons). It dynamically displays banners, coupon input, and available offers. Notably, it includes a placeholder for upsell products (`listOfProducts`) if the `isUpsellCall` flag is active, fetching data from `customizeUiData.upsell_data`.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx` (04/12/2025, 01:04:54 - 04/12/2025, 01:10:35):** This rich text editor component saw minor UI refinements and robustness improvements.
    *   **Error Message Positioning:** The "Field cannot be empty." error message's styling and placement were adjusted, including a negative top margin.
    *   **Placeholder Default:** The default `placeholder` prop was changed from a descriptive string to an empty string.
    *   **Layout Stability:** Changes were made to ensure consistent rendering of the character count and empty field message, even when the latter is not active, to prevent layout shifts.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` (04/12/2025, 12:27:04):** This component enables searching and selecting products or collections. It supports various configurations like hiding search inputs/buttons, showing quantity, collating products, and filtering based on tags (e.g., `no-agent` for agent-led contexts). It uses pagination with infinite scrolling via `useIntersectionObserver` and calls the `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` API.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts` (04/12/2025, 12:27:19):** This file defines API integration functions.
    *   **Upsell API:** Explicit functions `getAndDeleteUpsellData` (for fetching existing rules and deleting specific ones) and `pushUpsellData` (for creating/updating rules) are present, interacting with the `/api/dashboard/cart-upsell` endpoints.
    *   **Product/Collection APIs:** `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` handles fetching data, filtering by active status, and transforming product variants. `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` retrieves detailed information by ID.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts` (04/12/2025, 12:27:30):** This file consolidates all API endpoints. It includes a dedicated `upsellCheckout` section with `getandDeleteUpsellData` and `updateUpsellData` endpoints.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` (04/12/2025, 12:27:58):** This utility file provides various helper functions. The presence of `validateUpsellRules` (though its code is not shown) indicates that validation is performed on upsell rule data before submission.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts` (04/12/2025, 12:28:12):** This Redux slice manages the state for customizing the UI. It defines an `upsell_data` object in its `initialState` to store various properties of the upsell configuration, including `is_upsell_enabled`, `item_count_limit`, `applicable_items`, `discount` details, and product lists. The `updateUpsellState` reducer is used to modify this state.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx` (04/12/2025, 22:18:10 - 04/12/2025, 22:21:01):** This component renders the form for a single upsell rule.
    *   **Form Initialization:** An `useEffect` hook populates the form fields by fetching product/collection details and setting the `rule_applicable_on` and `discounted_price` flags.
    *   **Conditional Discount Fields:** The 'Discount Value' and 'Discount Capping' input fields are now conditionally displayed based on the `discounted_price` checkbox.
    *   **Discount Checkbox Logic:** The `onChange` handler for the `discounted_price` checkbox was updated to automatically set 'Discount Value' and 'Discount Capping' to 0 when the checkbox is *unchecked*, logically clearing discount fields when the discount option is disabled.
    *   **Redux Integration:** A debounced `useEffect` synchronizes the local form state of the current rule with the global `upsell_data` in the Redux store.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **03/12/2025, 23:03:49:** Initial major structural change to how upsell rules are rendered in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **03/12/2025, 23:57:21:** Resolution of a series of iterative changes to consistently display "Rule {index + 1}" in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 00:03:41:** Resolution of iterative changes to `key: index` in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 00:44:38:** Implementation of auto-expansion for new upsell rules in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 00:48:47:** Introduction of conditional visibility for upsell configuration based on a toggle in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 00:53:50:** Enhanced dynamic labeling for upsell rules in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 00:55:46:** Restoration of conditional visibility logic after a brief regression in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 01:00:41:** Stable state of `mobilePage.tsx`, showing its role in previewing upsell UI.
*   **04/12/2025, 01:08:30:** Refinement of error message rendering in `richtexteditor.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 11:25:06:** Final stabilization of index handling for `UpsellFormRenderer` in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 11:37:15:** Final layout of "Add New Upsell Rule" button in `upsellCheckout.tsx`.
*   **04/12/2025, 22:21:01:** Corrected logic for clearing discount fields when the `discounted_price` checkbox is unchecked in `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI/UX Iteration:** Frequent, small adjustments in `upsellCheckout.tsx` related to styling, component behavior (e.g., collapse panel expansion), and dynamic content generation demonstrate an iterative development and refinement process for the user experience.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The intermittent appearance and removal of `console.log` statements in `upsellCheckout.tsx` and `upsellFormRenderer.tsx` indicate active debugging phases during development.
*   **Modular Component Design:** The system heavily relies on reusable components like `RichTextEditor`, `ProductSearch`, and `RenderField` to construct complex forms, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
*   **State Management with Redux:** The Redux store (`@store/customize-ui`) acts as a centralized data repository for UI configuration, including detailed upsell settings, with dedicated reducers for updating specific parts of the state.
*   **API-Driven Configuration:** Configuration data for upsell rules is fetched from and pushed to backend APIs, emphasizing a dynamic, data-driven approach to feature management.
*   **Conditional Rendering and Feature Flags:** Extensive use of `Form.useWatch` and `hidden` attributes to dynamically adjust the visible UI based on user input or feature enablement, allowing for flexible configuration options.

## 12:56:50
The log details changes across two distinct files within an example React Native application part of a `kwikpass-app-rn` SDK.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/android/local.properties`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 04/12/2025, 15:06:18 and 04/12/2025, 15:06:37
    *   **Changes:** This file, which typically defines local environment properties for Android projects, saw a quick update. Initially, the `sdk.dir` property was set to `/Users/mac/Library/Android/sdk`. Within seconds, it was modified to `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Library/Android/sdk`, indicating a user-specific path adjustment for the Android SDK directory.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/src/screens/app/Checkout.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 04/12/2025, 15:23:24
    *   **Changes:** This is a significant update to a React Native TypeScript component responsible for a checkout screen.
        *   It imports necessary modules including `memo`, `Alert`, and components/functions from the SDK like `getCheckoutMultiPassToken` and `KPCheckout`.
        *   The `Checkout` functional component is defined, handling various events from the `KPCheckout` component.
        *   A `handleEvent` function processes messages related to the checkout flow:
            *   Displays an `Alert` if `checkout-initiation-failure` occurs.
            *   On `orderSuccess`, if an `gk_access_token` is present, it calls `getCheckoutMultiPassToken` with user data and logs the response.
            *   Navigates back (`navigation.goBack()`) on events like `order-complete`, `modal_closed`, `checkout-close`, or `orderSuccess`.
        *   `handleError` and `handleNavigationState` functions are included for logging purposes during the checkout process.
        *   The component renders a `KPCheckout` component, passing `checkoutData` (including a hardcoded `cartId`), and `onEvent`, `onError`, `onNavigationStateChange` handlers.
        *   The component is exported wrapped in `memo` for performance optimization.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes occurred on **04/12/2025**, suggesting active development within a short timeframe.
*   The changes are concentrated on setting up the local development environment (`local.properties`) and implementing core functionality for a checkout flow using a specific SDK (`kwikpass-app-rn`).
*   The path structure `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/` indicates these changes are happening within an example application designed to showcase the SDK's capabilities.
*   The `Checkout.tsx` file prominently features event-driven logic and integration with a `KPCheckout` component, suggesting a robust interaction model for handling various stages and outcomes of a checkout process provided by the Kwikpass SDK.

## 12:57:52
The log details code changes primarily within a `kwikpassV2` extension for an Appmaker starter application, focusing on the integration of a GoKwik checkout process. `.env` files, which may store sensitive keys, have been excluded from this summary.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` (and its mirrored path `/src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`)**
    *   **Initial Setup (27/11/2025, 18:51:28):** This React Native component integrates `KPCheckout` (a WebView component) to handle GoKwik checkout. It defines an `onEvent` callback to process messages from the WebView, specifically handling `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable` events. The `orderSuccess` case initially extracts `checkoutUrl`, `graphqlOrderId`, `gk_access_token`, and `email`, attempting to derive Shopify `orderID` and `orderKey` using regex, then dispatches `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` and conditionally `KWIKPASS_LOGIN`.
    *   **Order Success Logic Iterations (27/11/2025, 23:03:24 - 23:30:22):**
        *   An initial bug was introduced by changing the `orderSuccess` condition from `if (checkoutUrl && orderGID)` to `if (checkoutUrl)`, potentially leading to undefined `orderGID` access. This was quickly reverted.
        *   An `orderKeyRegexExtra` was introduced and used alongside `orderKeyRegex` to improve the robustness of extracting the `orderKey` from the `checkoutUrl` (27/11/2025, 23:16:36).
        *   A significant **refactoring** occurred (27/11/2025, 23:30:22) where `orderSuccess` handling was revamped: `orderKey` extraction was removed, a direct `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action was dispatched to redirect to the `checkoutUrl` (intended as the Shopify thank you page), and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` was called with an empty `orderKey`. This change included detailed comments explaining the new flow for Shopify order ID extraction and redirection.
    *   **Rollback and Refinements (27/11/2025, 23:50:11 - 28/11/2025, 12:41:56):**
        *   The major refactoring from 23:30:22 was **rolled back** (27/11/2025, 23:50:11), reverting to the earlier logic of extracting `orderId` and `orderKey` and using `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` with both.
        *   Logic to **prefix `checkoutUrl` with `https://`** if missing was introduced (28/11/2025, 00:25:40). This introduced temporary bugs where `checkoutUrl` was not correctly initialized, leading to runtime errors (28/11/2025, 00:44:33 - 07:47:14), but these were subsequently fixed (28/11/2025, 07:48:18).
        *   Further refinements were made to the `checkoutUrl` prefixing, specifically checking only for `https://` (28/11/2025, 07:55:12), and later adjusting the `orderKey` extraction and the conditions for calling `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` (28/11/2025, 11:09:45 - 11:12:09).
        *   Another major shift in `orderSuccess` occurred where `orderKey` extraction was again removed, and navigation to a Shopify `thank_you` page via `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` was re-introduced, sometimes conditionally based on `orderKey` presence, and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` was dispatched with an empty `orderKey` (28/11/2025, 12:25:54 - 12:41:56).
    *   **Stabilized Order Success Logic (28/11/2025, 17:10:35 onwards):** The `orderSuccess` logic was significantly simplified again, returning to a state similar to the pre-refactoring version where both `orderId` and `orderKey` are extracted using regex (with `orderKeyRegex`) and then used in the `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action. The explicit `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` redirect for the thank you page was removed from this handling.
    *   **Debugging Additions (01/12/2025, 17:55:47 - 17:58:52):** Temporary console logs were added to track `gokwik_events`, including fixing a typo in the event name check, but these were commented out shortly after (01/12/2025, 18:02:38).

2.  **`/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx` (27/11/2025, 18:54:00)**
    *   This file defines the `KPCheckout` React component, acting as a wrapper that passes `checkoutData` and event handlers to the underlying `Checkout` component.

3.  **`/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx` (27/11/2025, 18:57:26 - 20:20:11):**
    *   This core file contains the `WebView` implementation. It includes `injectJavaScript` for client-side event listening (`gokwikSdk` events like `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gokwik_events`, `gk-checkout-disable`).
    *   The `InitiateCheckout` function dynamically constructs the WebView URL based on merchant type ("shopify" or "custom") and various cached settings (merchant ID, environment, tokens, user email).
    *   It includes platform-specific handling for UPI app packages and intent URLs.
    *   No functional changes were observed across the entries for this file, only minor formatting.

4.  **`/packages/kwikpassV2/src/pages/CheckoutOptions.js` (28/11/2025, 14:48:50 - 14:52:20):**
    *   This file defines a `CheckoutOptions` page configuration, primarily embedding the `kwikpass/checkout` block within the Appmaker structure, setting basic UI attributes like `insideSafeAreaView` and `headerShown`. No functional changes were observed.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/11/2025, 18:51:28:** Initial implementation of `KwikPassCheckout.js` with basic GoKwik event handling.
*   **27/11/2025, 18:54:00:** Definition of the `KPCheckout` wrapper component.
*   **27/11/2025, 18:57:26:** Implementation of the core `Checkout.tsx` WebView with injected JavaScript for event communication.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:16:36:** Re-introduction of `orderKeyRegexExtra` for more robust `orderKey` extraction and a rollback of a temporary bug.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:30:22:** Major refactoring of `orderSuccess` in `KwikPassCheckout.js` to prioritize redirecting to the checkout URL over detailed `orderKey` extraction.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:50:11:** Rollback of the 23:30:22 refactoring, reverting to `orderId` and `orderKey` extraction.
*   **28/11/2025, 00:25:40:** Introduction of logic to ensure `checkoutUrl` has a protocol prefix.
*   **28/11/2025, 07:48:18:** Fixes for the `checkoutUrl` protocol prefixing logic.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:25:54 - 12:41:56:** Another series of changes to `orderSuccess` handling, involving conditional `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` for a thank you page and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` with an empty `orderKey`.
*   **28/11/2025, 17:10:35:** Significant rollback to a simpler `orderSuccess` handling, reinstating `orderKey` extraction and removing complex conditional navigations, which appears to be the more stable state going forward.
*   **01/12/2025, 17:55:47 - 18:02:38:** Brief introduction and removal of debugging code for `gokwik_events`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Debugging Output:** There is a recurring pattern of adding and modifying `console.log` statements, particularly within the `orderSuccess` case of `KwikPassCheckout.js`, indicating active development and troubleshooting of the checkout flow.
*   **Volatility in `orderSuccess` Handling:** The logic for `orderSuccess` within `KwikPassCheckout.js` is highly volatile, undergoing multiple refactorings, rollbacks, and bug fixes related to `checkoutUrl` formatting, Shopify `orderId` and `orderKey` extraction, and post-checkout navigation strategy (e.g., direct `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` vs. `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` to a thank you page).
*   **Code Duplication/Relocation:** The presence of identical code changes in both `/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` and `/src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` suggests a build step, file relocation, or perhaps local testing in a different path.
*   **Focus on Checkout Flow:** The vast majority of changes revolve around ensuring a smooth and correct checkout experience with the GoKwik integration, including proper event handling from the WebView, data extraction, and subsequent application actions (order completion, user login, navigation).
*   **Shopify Integration:** The code frequently interacts with Shopify-specific IDs and tokens, indicating a strong dependency on the Shopify platform for order and user management.
*   **External Package Usage:** The core logic relies heavily on external Appmaker and KwikPass packages (`@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package`, `@appmaker-xyz/core`, `@appmaker-xyz/shopify`, `@appmaker-xyz/react-native`).

## 13:04:58
The changes span across multiple files, primarily focusing on enhancements and refinements to the checkout upsell functionality within a dashboard UI, alongside updates to a rich text editor component and API integrations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 03/12/2025, starting 22:57:29, and continuing throughout.** This file shows highly iterative development and debugging.
    *   **UI/UX Refinements:**
        *   Minor styling changes to buttons within collapse headers (e.g., `type='text'` to `type='link'`, adding `hover:bg-transparent`).
        *   The structure for rendering dynamic upsell rules within the form was refactored, moving the iteration of `upsellItems` into a `type: 'custom'` form field.
        *   Introduced an `Alert` component from `gokwik-ui-kit` to display "Rule {index + 1}" within the collapse header, replacing plain text and removing an `UpOutlined` button. Conditional rendering of `rule?.title` or a "Text to be updated" fallback was added to the collapse item label.
    *   **State Management & Logic:**
        *   Repeated attempts to correctly manage the `activeKey` state for the `Collapse` component, particularly to auto-open newly added rules or maintain a specific rule's active state. This involved numerous conditional logic adjustments to the `key` prop and the `index` passed to `UpsellFormRenderer`, often followed by reverts, suggesting a complex state interaction. Ultimately, the logic for setting `activeKey` was moved to the `onClick` of the "Add New Upsell Rule" button (`setActiveKey([String(upsellItems.length)])`).
        *   Debugging `activeKey`, `isModalOpen?.position`, `upsellFilterItems`, and `upsellRules` was evident through temporary `console.log` statements and `return` in modal handlers.
        *   The logic for deleting unpersisted upsell rules in the modal (`onOk` handler) was adjusted multiple times to ensure correct splicing and form field updates.
        *   A performance optimization attempt was made using `useMemo` for `collapseItems` but was later removed.
    *   **Conditional Field Visibility:** Introduced `upsellEnabled = Form.useWatch(['cart_upsell', 'enabled'], form)` to dynamically hide/show related configuration fields (divider, cap quantity label, cap quantity input, and the entire upsell rules section) based on the "Cart Upsell" switch's state, using the `hidden` prop on form fields.
    *   **External Component Interaction:** The `index` prop passed to `UpsellFormRenderer` also saw several conditional adjustments, indicating challenges in correctly passing the array index to child components during dynamic rule management.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04/12/2025, 01:00:41**
    *   This component provides a preview for the mobile checkout UI. It uses Redux to get customization data and React states to manage active tabs (brand, login, payments, checkout elements, address, coupons). It renders various sections like logo, progress, carousel banners, and a coupon section, dynamically based on `customizeUiData` and the active tab. It also contains logic to filter reasons for checkout elements and lists products for upsell previews (though the upsell rendering itself is not in this file).

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04/12/2025, starting 01:04:54, and continuing.**
    *   **Placeholder Behavior:** Changed the default `placeholder` prop from a specific string to an empty string, influencing how the editor initializes when no `selectedValue` is provided.
    *   **Error Message & Character Count:** Minor adjustments were made to the positioning and conditional rendering of the "Field cannot be empty" validation message relative to the character count display. The error message is now conditionally wrapped in a `<span>` and positioned alongside the character count, with an empty `<div>` as a fallback to maintain layout.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04/12/2025, 12:27:04**
    *   A versatile component for searching and selecting products or collections. It supports fetching data from a Shopify backend, infinite scrolling, managing quantities for selected items, and includes features specific to agent-led operations (`isAgentLed`) and gift top-ups (`topUpGift`). It uses an internal modal for the search interface and provides `onAdd`/`onRemove` callbacks for external state management.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04/12/2025, 12:27:19**
    *   New API calls were added or modified:
        *   `getAndDeleteUpsellData`: Handles fetching and deleting cart upsell rules.
        *   `pushUpsellData`: Used for creating or updating (upserting) cart upsell rules.
        *   `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId`: A new utility to fetch details for product variants, collections, or products by their IDs, with a sophisticated response mapping logic to group variants under their parent products or map collections.
        *   `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`: Enhanced to filter products by `status === 'active'` and include `isAgentLed` filtering based on product tags. It also transforms product variants into individual entries for product search if no specific title is provided.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04/12/2025, 12:27:30**
    *   New endpoint definitions were added:
        *   `upsellCheckout`: Contains `getandDeleteUpsellData` and `updateUpsellData` endpoints for cart upsell management.
        *   `checkoutLinks`: Added endpoints for listing, getting by ID, creating, and updating checkout links.
        *   Dedicated endpoints for fetching details by ID: `getVariantById`, `getCollectionById`, `getProductById`.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04/12/2025, 12:27:58**
    *   No new functions were added within this specific log entry, but it defines a suite of helper functions for dynamic search filters, date/amount formatting, Shopify checkout status, deep object comparison, debouncing, date/time disabling, string capitalization, table column extraction, data sorting, CSV upload validation, and array comparison. These are general utilities used throughout the application.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04/12/2025, 12:28:12**
    *   The Redux store's `initialState` was expanded to include a detailed `upsell_data` object, defining its structure for enabling upsell, item count limits, applicable rules (all, products, collections), discount configurations, and product lists. A new `updateUpsellState` reducer was added to manage this new data slice.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **Timestamp: 04/12/2025, 21:49:13**
    *   This EJS template defines the foundational HTML structure for the dashboard. It configures the Content Security Policy (CSP), loads shared dependencies via SystemJS import maps (conditionally for local, dev, qa, sandbox, production environments), and integrates third-party analytics/monitoring scripts (Microsoft Clarity and New Relic Browser) specifically for the production environment. No functional changes to logic, but provides context for the deployment setup.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development on Upsell Feature:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around the "Upsell on Checkout" feature (`upsellCheckout.tsx`, `api.ts`, `apiEndpoints.ts`, `customize-ui/index.ts`). This suggests an active development phase for implementing and refining this specific functionality, including its UI, API interactions, and state management.
*   **Iterative UI Refinement and Debugging:** The `upsellCheckout.tsx` and `richtexteditor.tsx` files show a pattern of frequent, small commits. This indicates an iterative process of building, testing, and debugging UI elements and their associated state logic, particularly for dynamic lists, conditional rendering, and form interactions. Repeated changes to collapse item indexing and active key management highlight areas of complex UI state.
*   **Modularity and Reusability:** Components like `RichTextEditor` and `ProductSearch` are designed for reusability. `UpsellFormRenderer` uses these generic components, showcasing a modular architecture.
*   **Data Flow and State Management:** Redux (`customize-ui/index.ts`, `updateUpsellState`) and React's local state (`useState`, `useRef`, `Form.useWatch`) are extensively used to manage application data and UI interactions. Debouncing (`setTimeout` and `useRef`) is used for optimizing `useEffect` calls.
*   **API Integration:** The application relies heavily on internal APIs (`makeAPICall`, `APIEndPoints`) for data persistence and retrieval, including specific endpoints for upsell rules, checkout links, and product/collection details.
*   **CSS Framework:** Consistent use of Tailwind CSS classes (e.g., `flex`, `gap-x-2`, `rounded-md`, `text-sm`) for styling across components.
*   **Timestamp Pattern:** All changes were logged across two consecutive days, December 3rd and 4th, 2025 (or potentially 2024 if the year is a typo), with many rapid changes occurring within the same hour, especially on December 4th. This points to intensive development and quick iterations.

## 13:56:52
The changes log details updates primarily within a `kwikpass-app-rn` SDK example, occurring on the same date, 04/12/2025.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/android/local.properties`**: This configuration file saw two rapid updates.
    *   At **15:06:18**, the `sdk.dir` was initially set to `/Users/mac/Library/Android/sdk`.
    *   Shortly after, at **15:06:37**, it was updated to `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Library/Android/sdk`, indicating a change in the Android SDK path, likely reflecting a switch in the development environment or user.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/src/screens/app/Checkout.tsx`**: A new React Native screen component named `Checkout` was introduced or significantly modified at **15:23:24**.
    *   This component integrates `KPCheckout` and `getCheckoutMultiPassToken` from the SDK.
    *   It includes comprehensive event handling (`handleEvent`) for various checkout states:
        *   `checkout-initiation-failure` triggers an `Alert.alert`.
        *   `orderSuccess` conditionally calls `getCheckoutMultiPassToken` with user details (phone, email, `gk_access_token`) and logs the response.
        *   Multiple events (`order-complete`, `modal_closed`, `checkout-close`, `orderSuccess`) prompt `navigation.goBack()`.
    *   Error logging (`handleError`) and navigation state change logging (`handleNavigationState`) are also implemented.
    *   The `KPCheckout` component is rendered with a static `cartId` and hooks for `onEvent`, `onError`, and `onNavigationStateChange`.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   All recorded changes occurred on **04/12/2025**, suggesting a focused session of development or configuration adjustments.
*   The file paths indicate work within an example application for a `kwikpass-app-rn` SDK, touching both Android native configuration and a React Native TypeScript component.
*   The `Checkout.tsx` file demonstrates a pattern of robust event-driven logic for handling a checkout flow, specifically reacting to success, failure, and completion events from an integrated checkout process, and using `console.log` for debugging throughout.

## 13:57:03
The provided logs show a series of extensive changes primarily focused on the integration and refinement of a "KwikPass" checkout flow within an Appmaker Expo application. The changes span two days, November 27th and 28th, and December 1st, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`**
    *   **Timestamp (Significant Changes):** Many changes throughout November 27th (18:51:28 to 23:06:37) and November 28th (00:25:40 to 12:41:56), then again on December 1st (16:14:46 to 18:04:25).
    *   **Content:** This file contains the core React Native component for the KwikPass checkout.
        *   **Initial Focus (27/11, ~18:51):** The component handles events from a WebView, specifically for `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable`. It includes logic to extract Shopify Order ID and Key from the checkout URL and GraphQL Order ID, and attempts to auto-login users with a KwikPass token if they aren't already logged in. It also manages navigation states and actions like `GO_BACK`, `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`, `KWIKPASS_LOGIN`, `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW`, and `OPEN_SHOPIFY_NATIVE_CHECKOUT`.
        *   **Refinement and Debugging (27/11, ~22:53 onwards):** Numerous console logs (`console.log`) were added and modified to trace the flow of `orderSuccess` events, specifically to debug the extraction of `orderKey` and `orderId` from `checkoutUrl` and `orderGID`.
        *   **Major Refactor of `orderSuccess` (27/11, 23:30:22):** The logic within the `orderSuccess` case was significantly restructured and commented. It explicitly outlines three key steps:
            1.  Extracting Shopify Order ID solely from the GraphQL GID.
            2.  Redirecting the customer to GoKwik's `checkoutUrl` using `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW`, emphasizing *not* to manually extract or rebuild Shopify URLs. The `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action was removed from this block temporarily.
            3.  Implementing auto-login using the GoKwik token (`gkAccessToken`) if the user is not already logged in.
        *   **Further Adjustments to `orderSuccess` and `checkoutUrl` Handling (28/11, ~00:25 to 07:55):**
            *   Introduced logic to prefix `checkoutUrl` with `https://` if it's missing (e.g., `if (checkoutUrl && !checkoutUrl.startsWith('http://') && !checkoutUrl.startsWith('https://')) { checkoutUrl = \`https://${checkoutUrl}\`; }`).
            *   Added an `orderKeyRegexExtra` for more robust order key extraction, but then this was commented out or refined in subsequent commits, indicating an iterative debugging process.
            *   The `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action's `orderKey` parameter was made optional (e.g., `orderKey:orderKey || ''`).
        *   **Changes to `orderSuccess` flow (28/11, ~12:25 to 12:41):**
            *   The logic to extract `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl` was commented out or removed.
            *   Instead of `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` immediately, it now prioritizes opening a generic Shopify "thank you" page in a WebView, constructing the URL with the extracted `orderId` (e.g., `https://${props?.blockData?.shopDomain || 'your-shop.myshopify.com'}/thank_you?order_id=${orderId}`).
            *   The `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action is called with an empty `orderKey` after opening the thank you page.
            *   The explicit check for `checkoutUrl` starting with `http://` or `https://` was simplified, and the `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action directly uses the `checkoutUrl` if available, or constructs it with `https://` if not present.
        *   **Minor Console Log Changes (01/12):** Added `console.log(message?.eventname,"Event Name and Data")` for better event tracing. Briefly attempted to add a `gokwik_events` counter, which was then commented out.

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 27/11/2025, 18:54:00
    *   **Content:** This file appears to be an intermediary component (`KPCheckout`) that wraps the actual `Checkout` component. It passes `checkoutData` and event handlers (`onEvent`, `onError`, `onNavigationStateChange`) down. The `handleCheckoutMessage` callback simply forwards messages to the `onEvent` prop. There's a `console.log` for rendering `KPCheckout` with `checkoutData`. No significant functional changes were observed in this log entry, only its initial state.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp (Significant Changes):** 27/11/2025, 18:57:26 and 27/11/2025, 18:59:47, then 20:20:11 and 20:35:26.
    *   **Content:** This is the core WebView component responsible for displaying the GoKwik checkout.
        *   **Initial State (27/11, 18:57):** Contains `injectJavaScript` for the WebView to listen to `gokwikSdk` events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gokwik_events`, `gk-checkout-disable`) and post them back to React Native. It also defines `UPI_APP_PACKAGES` and includes logic for `InitiateCheckout` (handling both "custom" and "shopify" merchant types), `backButtonHandler`, `handleError`, `showAlert`, `convertToIntentUrl`, `handlePaymentIntent`, and `handleMessage`. The `InitiateCheckout` builds the WebView URL based on cached merchant information and app/device details, encoding `storeInfo` and `gkToken` using base64. It also ensures `cartId` is prefixed with `gid://shopify/Cart/` if necessary.
        *   **No noticeable functional changes across the recorded timestamps for this file.** The content remains identical for all provided logs, indicating that this file was stable or not the focus of the changes during this period, or that any changes were reverted/minor enough to not show up in the provided diff.

4.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/pages/CheckoutOptions.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 28/11/2025, 14:48:50 and 14:52:20.
    *   **Content:** This file defines a page structure for `CheckoutOptions` within the Appmaker framework. It includes a single block, `kwikpass/checkout`, indicating that this page is designed to render the KwikPass checkout component. No functional changes were observed in this file in the provided logs; it appears to be a static configuration.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **27/11/2025, 18:51:28:** Initial commit or major update to `KwikPassCheckout.js` with comprehensive event handling for GoKwik SDK.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:30:22:** Major refactoring within `KwikPassCheckout.js` to streamline `orderSuccess` handling, separating order ID extraction, redirect logic, and auto-login. The previous logic for extracting `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl` was largely replaced with a direct WebView redirect to the `checkoutUrl`.
*   **28/11/2025, 00:25:40:** Introduction of logic in `KwikPassCheckout.js` to ensure `checkoutUrl` is properly prefixed with `https://`.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:25:54:** Shift in `KwikPassCheckout.js` for `orderSuccess` handling, moving from attempting to extract `orderKey` from the `checkoutUrl` to directly opening a Shopify thank you page URL constructed with the extracted `orderId`. The `orderKey` is now passed as an empty string to `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:37:42 - 12:41:56:** Further refinements and adjustments in `KwikPassCheckout.js` around handling `checkoutUrl` in `orderSuccess`, including conditional URL prefixing and explicitly setting `orderKey` to `''` when dispatching `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`.
*   **28/11/2025, 14:48:50:** The `CheckoutOptions.js` file appeared, defining the page structure.
*   **01/12/2025, 16:14:46 - 18:04:25:** Minor changes in `KwikPassCheckout.js` involving console logs and a brief, then commented-out, attempt to track 'gokwik_events' within the `onEvent` function.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **GoKwik Integration:** The entire log revolves around integrating the GoKwik checkout SDK into an Appmaker Expo application.
*   **WebView Communication:** Frequent use of `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage` in `Checkout.tsx` to communicate events from the WebView JavaScript context to the React Native component, and the `onEvent` prop in `KwikPassCheckout.js` to receive these messages.
*   **Event Handling (`onEvent` switch statement):** The `switch (message.eventname)` block in `KwikPassCheckout.js` is a central point for processing various GoKwik-related events: `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable`.
*   **Order Success Logic:** The `orderSuccess` event handling is a consistently modified section, with multiple iterations focusing on:
    *   Extracting `orderId` from Shopify GraphQL GID.
    *   Handling `checkoutUrl` (ensuring `https://` prefix, deciding between direct navigation and constructing a generic thank-you page URL).
    *   Extracting `orderKey` (this part underwent significant changes, eventually being simplified or bypassed by navigating to a generic thank-you page).
    *   Conditional user auto-login using `gkAccessToken`.
*   **Console Logging:** Extensive use of `console.log` statements throughout the `KwikPassCheckout.js` file, indicating active debugging and tracing of data flow, especially related to order ID and key extraction.
*   **Shopify Integration:** Explicit handling of Shopify-specific IDs (e.g., `gid://shopify/Cart/`, `gid://shopify/Order/`) and actions (`SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`, `OPEN_SHOPIFY_NATIVE_CHECKOUT`).
*   **Base64 Encoding:** The `Checkout.tsx` file uses `base64.encode` for `storeInfoData` and `gkToken` when constructing the WebView URL, suggesting a secure or standardized way of passing data to the GoKwik checkout.
*   **UPI Payment Handling:** `Checkout.tsx` includes specific logic for handling UPI payment intents (`convertToIntentUrl`, `handlePaymentIntent`) and showing platform-specific error messages for `UPI_APP_NOT_INSTALLED`.

The changes primarily focus on the development and refinement of an "Upsell On Checkout" feature within a dashboard UI.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**
Between March 12, 2025, 22:57:29 and April 12, 2025, 11:37:15, this file underwent continuous iteration:
*   **Initial Setup & Styling (03/12, 22:57 - 23:03):** The component `UpsellForCheckout` was established to manage upsell rules. Early changes involved minor styling adjustments, such as modifying the `type` of the collapse button from `text` to `link`.
*   **Form Structure Refactoring (03/12, 23:03):** The rendering logic for upsell items and the "Add New Upsell Rule" button were moved from direct JSX to a custom field type within a `fields` array, making the form structure more dynamic.
*   **Collapse State Management (03/12, 23:05 - 23:06):** The `activeKey` state, which controls the expanded/collapsed state of rules, was frequently adjusted (`[]` to `['0']`, then temporary `defaultActiveKey` additions/removals) to control which rules are open by default, particularly upon initial load.
*   **Debugging Activities (recurring):** Numerous `console.log` statements were temporarily added for debugging state (`activeKey`, `upsellEnabled`) and deletion logic within the modal's `onOk` handler.
*   **Rule Deletion Logic Refinement (03/12, 23:18 - 03/12, 23:25):** The modal's logic for deleting upsell rules was refined to correctly handle both existing (ID-based deletion via API) and newly added, unsaved rules (splice from local state).
*   **Dynamic Rule Labeling (03/12, 23:48 - 03/12, 23:57):** The display logic for "Rule {index + 1}" in collapse headers was modified repeatedly with complex conditional expressions, indicating challenges in consistently numbering rules, especially during additions/deletions. It eventually reverted to a simpler `index + 1`.
*   **`UpsellFormRenderer` Indexing & `activeKey` Behavior (04/12, 00:01 - 00:40):** The `index` prop passed to the nested `UpsellFormRenderer` was adjusted multiple times based on rule count, along with various attempts to set `activeKey` to automatically open the most recently added or first rule.
*   **Conditional Field Visibility (04/12, 00:48 - 00:51):** A new `upsellEnabled` state was introduced using `Form.useWatch` to dynamically show/hide parts of the upsell configuration (like cap quantity and rule management sections) based on whether the main "Cart Upsell" switch is enabled.
*   **Enhanced Rule Labels (04/12, 00:53 - 00:57):** The collapse item labels were significantly enhanced to include the rule's `title` (with a fallback "Text to be updated" if empty) using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, and an `Alert` component for "Rule {index + 1}". The up/down arrow button was removed from the label, leaving the collapse functionality to the Ant Design `Collapse` component itself.
*   **UI Element Reordering (04/12, 11:36):** The "Add New Upsell Rule" button was reordered within the custom render field to appear before the list of existing upsell rules. The `activeKey` behavior on adding a new rule was changed to default to opening the first rule (`['0']`).

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
On April 12, 2025, 01:00:41, an `Alert` component was imported. The `listOfProducts` variable was updated to conditionally retrieve upsell product data from the Redux store if the `isUpsellCall` flag is true, indicating integration with the upsell feature's data.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**
Between April 12, 2025, 01:04:54 and April 12, 2025, 01:10:35, the `RichTextEditor` component was modified:
*   **Placeholder Default (04/12, 01:04):** The default `placeholder` prop was changed to an empty string.
*   **Error Message Layout (04/12, 01:06 - 01:10):** The positioning and conditional rendering of the "Field cannot be empty." error message relative to the character count display were adjusted for better layout.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
On April 12, 2025, 12:27:04, this file shows no notable functional changes in the provided log, primarily serving as context for its usage in `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
On April 12, 2025, 12:27:19, the API utility file was updated to:
*   Introduce new API endpoints for fetching product, variant, and collection details by ID.
*   Enhance the `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function to correctly handle and map data for variants, collections, and products.
*   Refine the `getAndDeleteUpsellData` function signature to handle optional parameters.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
On April 12, 2025, 12:27:30, new API endpoints were added:
*   `/api/dashboard/product/get-variant-details`
*   `/api/dashboard/collection/get-collection-details`
*   `/api/dashboard/product/get-product-details`
*   A new `upsellCheckout` object containing `/api/dashboard/cart-upsell` (for get and delete) and `/api/dashboard/cart-upsell/upsert` (for push) was added.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts`**
On April 12, 2025, 12:27:58, the `validateUpsellRules` function was added, indicating new validation logic for upsell configurations.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
On April 12, 2025, 12:28:12, the Redux store's `customize-ui` slice was updated:
*   A new `upsell_data` object was added to the `initialState` to store various upsell configurations (e.g., enablement, item limits, discount details).
*   A new `updateUpsellState` reducer was introduced to manage updates to this `upsell_data`.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**
Between April 12, 2025, 22:18:10 and April 12, 2025, 22:21:01, this component was newly created and developed:
*   This new component is responsible for rendering the detailed form for individual upsell rules.
*   It integrates `RichTextEditor` for rule titles, `InputNumber` for carousel item limits, and `ProductSearch` for selecting applicable products/collections and upsell items.
*   It includes radio buttons to define whether the rule applies to 'all products', 'specific collections', or 'specific products'.
*   It features a checkbox to enable/disable discounted pricing, which then reveals input fields for 'Discount Value' and 'Discount Capping'.
*   Initial data fetching and form field setting logic is implemented using `useEffect` and `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId`.
*   Changes to the checkbox for `discounted_price` now explicitly reset discount `value` and `capping` to `0` when unchecked.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
On April 12, 2025, 21:49:13, the import map for various micro-frontends was updated, including adding `@gokwik/kwikcomm` for `dev` and `qa` environments and adjusting the local checkout URL. This file also includes analytics and monitoring scripts for the `production` environment.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Upsell Feature Focus:** A consistent theme is the development, integration, and refinement of the "Upsell On Checkout" feature across multiple components (`upsellCheckout`, `upsellFormRenderer`, `mobilePage`) and supporting utilities (API, Redux store, helpers).
*   **State Management and UI Feedback:** Repeated adjustments to `activeKey` and conditional rendering highlight an ongoing effort to improve the user experience and visual feedback for dynamically added/edited rules.
*   **Debugging:** Frequent insertion and removal of `console.log` statements are indicative of an iterative debugging process, particularly for complex state logic and data manipulation.
*   **API Integration:** The new upsell features necessitate the addition of new API endpoints and associated helper functions for data fetching and persistence.
*   **Form Logic:** Extensive use of Ant Design's `Form.useWatch` demonstrates a reliance on reactive form logic to control UI elements and data flow.
*   **Module Interaction:** The changes show clear interaction between different parts of the application, including UI components, API services, and the Redux store, all contributing to the new upsell functionality.

## 14:56:51
**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/android/local.properties`**
This configuration file saw two rapid updates to the `sdk.dir` property on **04/12/2025**.
-   At `15:06:18`, the `sdk.dir` was initially set to `/Users/mac/Library/Android/sdk`.
-   Shortly after, at `15:06:37`, it was updated to `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Library/Android/sdk`, indicating a user-specific adjustment to the Android SDK path.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/kwikpass-app-rn/example/src/screens/app/Checkout.tsx`**
A new React Native component named `Checkout` was introduced or significantly updated on **04/12/2025, 15:23:24**.
-   The component imports `memo` from `react` and `Alert` from `react-native`, alongside `getCheckoutMultiPassToken` and `KPCheckout` from the local SDK source.
-   It defines a `Checkout` screen that integrates the `KPCheckout` component.
-   **Event Handling (`handleEvent`):**
    -   Displays an `Alert` if a `checkout-initiation-failure` event occurs.
    -   On an `orderSuccess` event, it checks for a `gk_access_token` and, if present, calls `getCheckoutMultiPassToken` with user details (phone, email, access token), logging the response.
    -   Triggers `navigation.goBack()` for various completion or close events, including `order-complete`, `modal_closed`, `checkout-close`, and `orderSuccess`.
-   Includes `handleError` and `handleNavigationState` functions for logging errors and webview navigation state within the checkout process.
-   The `KPCheckout` component is rendered with a hardcoded `cartId` in `merchantParams` and uses the defined event handlers.
-   The component is exported wrapped in `memo` for performance optimization.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
-   All recorded changes occurred on the same date, **04/12/2025**.
-   The updates to `local.properties` show a quick succession of changes to a configuration path, suggesting an immediate correction or personalization step.
-   The `Checkout.tsx` file demonstrates a common pattern for integrating and handling events from an SDK component (`KPCheckout`), covering success, failure, and navigation/closure scenarios, characteristic of a robust example or test implementation.

# Activity Summary for 08/12/2025

## 13:37:04
The `local.properties` file in the `example/android` directory underwent two quick updates on April 12, 2025. Initially, at 15:06:18, the `sdk.dir` property was set to `/Users/mac/Library/Android/sdk`. This was subsequently changed at 15:06:37 to `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Library/Android/sdk`, indicating a modification to the local Android SDK path.

A significant update occurred at 15:23:24 on April 12, 2025, within the `example/src/screens/app/Checkout.tsx` file. This file introduces a React Native `Checkout` screen responsible for handling a checkout flow. Key aspects of this change include:
- Importing and utilizing components and functions from a local SDK (`../../../../src`), specifically `KPCheckout` and `getCheckoutMultiPassToken`.
- Implementing an `handleEvent` function to manage various checkout states:
    - Displaying an `Alert` for `checkout-initiation-failure`.
    - On `orderSuccess`, it checks for a `gk_access_token` and, if present, calls `getCheckoutMultiPassToken` with user details (phone, email) before logging the response.
    - It triggers `navigation.goBack()` for `order-complete`, `modal_closed`, `checkout-close`, and `orderSuccess` events.
- Providing `handleError` and `handleNavigationState` functions for comprehensive logging of errors and WebView navigation state changes during the checkout process.
- The `KPCheckout` component is rendered with `checkoutData` that includes `merchantParams` specifying a `cartId` (e.g., `gid://shopify/Cart/...`).
- The component itself is memoized using `memo` for performance optimization.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
- All recorded changes occurred on the same day, April 12, 2025, within a short timeframe (approximately 17 minutes).
- The file paths indicate these changes are part of an example application (`kwikpass-app-rn/example`) demonstrating the usage of a `kwikpass` SDK.
- The `Checkout.tsx` file heavily relies on logging (`console.log`) for debugging and monitoring, specifically using `JSON.stringify` to log object details for events, errors, and navigation states.

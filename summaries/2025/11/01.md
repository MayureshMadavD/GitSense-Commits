# Activity Summary for 01/11/2025

## 08:50:38
The log details changes exclusively to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

This Dockerfile defines the build process for a Node.js application, using `node:20-alpine` as its base image. The standard steps involve:
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl`.
*   Copying `package*.json` files for efficient caching.
*   Installing Node.js dependencies.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema using `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application with `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port `3000`.
*   Starting the application with `npm start`.

Between 28/10/2025, 12:27:10 and 28/10/2025, 12:29:42, the Dockerfile content remained identical across multiple timestamps.

A significant update occurred on **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**, where the command for installing dependencies was changed from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This indicates the removal of the "force" flag during the npm dependency installation process.

The recurring pattern is the consistent structure and sequence of build commands, indicating a well-defined and largely stable Dockerization strategy for the application, with only a minor adjustment to the dependency installation command.

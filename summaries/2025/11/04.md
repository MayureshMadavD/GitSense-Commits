# Activity Summary for 04/11/2025

## 09:43:17
The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` saw several updates between October 28th and 29th, 2025. The initial versions (28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 12:27:41; 12:29:42) were identical, establishing a Docker build process for a Node.js 20 Alpine application. This process includes setting a working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json` and installing dependencies with `npm install -f`, copying the entire source, generating Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting with `npm start`. A significant change occurred on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file received updates on November 3rd, 2025.
The first recorded change on 03/11/2025 at 17:38:44 introduced a robust email reporting system:
*   A `POST` endpoint was added to receive image data, header name, and report ID, saving this information to a backend via `pngReportData`.
*   Functions `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` were implemented to fetch report data, format dates, filter for daily/weekly reports, and then trigger email sending. `sendDailyReport` also includes a call to `deletepngReportData` after a successful email.
*   The `sendEmailForReport` asynchronous function was created to handle the actual email dispatch using `nodemailer`, configuring a transporter with environment variables for host, port, and authentication. It generates an HTML email with an embedded PNG image.
*   A `GET` endpoint was added to manually trigger `sendDailyReport` and return a status message.
*   Cron job schedules for daily and weekly reports were present but commented out, indicating planned future automation.

A subsequent minor update on 03/11/2025 at 17:39:41 changed the `from` email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in".
Finally, on 03/11/2025 at 18:12:32, a `console.log(res)` statement was added after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` in the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely for debugging the email sending process.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Project Structure:** The file paths indicate a Next.js project (`app/api` directory) with a backend API route.
*   **Dependency Management:** The Dockerfile consistently uses Node.js 20 Alpine and npm for dependency management, with a slight adjustment in the `npm install` command.
*   **Prisma ORM:** The Dockerfile includes `npx prisma generate`, indicating the use of Prisma for database interactions.
*   **Email Functionality:** The `sendemail/route.ts` file shows a strong focus on email-based reporting, utilizing `nodemailer`, `date-fns`, and custom backend queries for report data.
*   **Environment Variable Reliance:** The email sending functionality heavily relies on environment variables (e.g., `EMAIL_HOST`, `PORT_NO`, `SMTP_EMAIL`, `SMTP_PASS`, `PARENT_EMAIL`), implying external configuration for email services.
*   **Cron Job Intent:** While commented out, the presence of `node-cron` schedules suggests an intention to automate daily and weekly report emails.

The `mint-dashboard` project underwent a series of focused updates between late October and early November 2025, primarily affecting its Docker build process and email reporting functionality.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   Between 28/10/2025 and 29/10/2025, this file saw minor iterations. The core build steps remained consistent, utilizing `node:20-alpine` as a base, setting `/app` as the working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json` for dependency installation, copying the entire source code, generating Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting the application with `npm start`.
    *   A notable change occurred around 29/10/2025, 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`, removing the force flag.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**:
    *   This file, responsible for handling email reports, saw two key changes on 03/11/2025.
    *   At 17:39:41, the sender email domain was updated within the `sendEmailForReport` function, changing `from: "integration-noreply@gokwik.co"` to `from: "integration-noreply@gokwik.in"`.
    *   Later, at 18:12:32, logging was added to the email sending process: `let res = await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions); console.log(res)` was introduced, indicating an attempt to debug or monitor the email delivery status.
    *   The file uses `nodemailer` for sending emails, `date-fns` for date formatting, `node-cron` (though commented out for daily/weekly report scheduling), and interacts with backend queries for `pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, and `deletepngReportData`. It supports saving and sending daily and weekly image reports.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Application Focus**: The changes indicate an application focused on reporting, specifically generating and emailing daily/weekly reports containing images. It utilizes Prisma for database interaction and Node.js/Next.js for the application logic.
*   **Email Configuration**: There's a strong emphasis on email functionality, with the `sendemail/route.ts` file being refined for sender details and delivery logging.
*   **Build Process Consistency**: The Dockerfile remains largely stable, suggesting a well-defined build process for the application, with only minor tweaks to dependency handling.
*   **Timeframe**: All recorded changes fall within a short, concentrated period, primarily late October and early November 2025, suggesting active development or debugging cycles during this time.

The provided log details code changes across several JavaScript/TypeScript files within a `checkout-dashboard-ui` project, focusing on shipping settings, UI customization for login pages, and bulk discount creation.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 17:25:08 - 29/10/2025, 17:25:38**
        *   Initial code includes a `ProductBasedShipping` component using `Form`, `Card`, `Table`, and `Drawer` from `gokwik-ui-kit`. It manages shipping rules based on products/collections.
        *   The `handleFormSubmit` function processes form values, identifies a `targetedShipping` item, and conditionally removes `product_based_rules` from a `deleteProductShipping` object if a drawer is open and `previousShippingId` exists. It also handles default values for `price_multiplier` and `combine_with_weight_based`. The `saveConfig` call is commented out, as are related state resets.
        *   A `console.log(shippingPrices)` statement was added within `handleFormSubmit`.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 17:27:06**
        *   Another `console.log(previousShippingId)` was added to `handleFormSubmit`.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 17:30:43 - 29/10/2025, 17:32:12**
        *   The previously commented-out `saveConfig`, `setItemsData`, `setModalOpen`, and `form.resetFields` calls were uncommented in `handleFormSubmit`, activating the save functionality.
    *   **Timestamp: 30/10/2025, 10:35:02 - 30/10/2025, 10:36:15**
        *   A `console.log(shippingPrices)` was added inside the `useEffect` hook that updates `shippingPrices` from `config?.shipping_prices`.
        *   Later, this `console.log` was changed to `console.log(config?.shipping_prices)`.
    *   **Timestamp: 31/10/2025, 23:09:53 - 31/10/2025, 23:20:57**
        *   The logic for updating `targetedShipping.product_based_rules` in `handleFormSubmit` was modified to append new `formValues` to an existing array using the spread operator: `[...(targetedShipping?.product_based_rules || []), formValues]`.
        *   A conditional `delete formValues.shipping_id` was added, ensuring `shipping_id` is only deleted if `formValues?.shipping_id` exists.
        *   The `saveConfig` call and related state resets were commented out again, and a `return` statement was added, effectively disabling the save.
    *   **Timestamp: 31/10/2025, 23:26:00**
        *   Changes were made to the conditional logic when `open && previousShippingId` is true. Specifically, `delete deleteProductShipping.product_based_rules` was commented out, and a `console.log(editedShipping)` was added.
    *   **Timestamp: 31/10/2025, 23:40:49 - 01/11/2025, 12:04:22**
        *   More complex logic was introduced for handling `deleteProductShipping.product_based_rules`. If there's only one rule, the `product_based_rules` property is deleted entirely. If there are multiple rules, there's an attempt to filter and delete a specific matching rule, although the implementation of `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]` seems incorrect for removing an item from an array.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 17:29:02**
        *   This file defines `processProductBasedShippingData` which handles UI logic for product-based shipping rules, including table data mapping, form fields, and item manipulation.
        *   It introduces `itemsData` and `previousShippingId` states.
        *   The `selectedOptions` `useMemo` hook now includes logic to disable options that are already mapped, unless the drawer is open and the option is currently being edited.
        *   The `itemColumnData` now includes a delete button that removes items from `itemsData` and updates form fields for `variant_ids` and `collection_ids`.
        *   The `fields` array defines the form structure, including inputs for rule name, price, shipping ID, calculation method, price multiplier, and weight combination. It also contains custom renderers for `ProductSearch` components to add products or collections, and a table to display selected items.
    *   **Timestamp: 31/10/2025, 23:05:43 - 01/11/2025, 12:16:10**
        *   The `disabled` property within the `selectedOptions` `useMemo` hook was commented out. This change effectively removes the logic that prevents users from selecting already mapped shipping IDs or re-selecting the currently edited one.
        *   Several minor changes to indentation and whitespace, but no functional changes from 31/10/2025, 23:05:43 onwards in this file.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:04:43**
        *   The `initialState.login_data` was updated to include `is_consent_auto_select: true`.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:27:17**
        *   The property `is_consent_required` in `initialState.login_data` was renamed to `isConsentVisible`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:09:05**
        *   The `Login` component manages UI customization for the login page, including banner and consent sections. It uses `useMerchantConfigApi` for config management and `updateLoginData` from Redux.
        *   Initial `fields` array contained only a custom renderer for the 'Banner'.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:17:05 - 29/10/2025, 18:19:02**
        *   A new field of `type: 'switch'` was added to the `fields` array to control the visibility and text of the "Primary Button" (CTA Text).
        *   Styling changes were made to the `p` tag within the newly added field's `label` (changed class from `text-gray-500` to `font-light text-gray-500`).
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:18:16 - 29/10/2025, 18:21:54**
        *   The `Card` component for the banner was moved into the `fields.map` loop, meaning each field is now wrapped in its own `Card`.
        *   Minor styling adjustments to font weights (e.g., `font-normal` added to `span` class).
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:23:18 - 29/10/2025, 18:26:23**
        *   The Primary Button section was also converted to a `type: 'custom'` field within the `fields` array, consolidating more UI logic into the `fields` definition.
        *   A `Consent Section` field was added to the `fields` array as a `type: 'custom'` component, using `RenderEditorFunction`. The hardcoded `Card` for this section was removed from the main JSX.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:27:00**
        *   The initial state's `login_data.is_consent_required` was renamed to `isConsentVisible`.
        *   The `RenderEditorFunction` call for the `Consent Section` was updated to use `loginFormData?.isConsentVisible` instead of `is_consent_required`.
        *   The `handleFormSubmit` validation logic was updated to check `formData?.login_data?.isConsentVisible`.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:39:37 - 29/10/2025, 18:40:13**
        *   Imported `BannerComponentRendrer`.
        *   The 'Consent Section' `type: 'custom'` field was further refactored. The `RenderEditorFunction` was removed, and instead, a `Switch` for `isConsentVisible` and a `BannerComponentRendrer` (conditional on `isConsentVisible`) were directly embedded, providing more granular control over the consent text display.
        *   The descriptive text for the Consent Section was moved directly into the render function.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:44:05 - 29/10/2025, 18:46:01**
        *   An "Auto-select offers and updates consent box on checkout" switch (`is_consent_auto_select`) was added to the Consent Section field, along with a descriptive paragraph.
        *   Initial values now include `is_consent_auto_select: true`.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:58:39**
        *   A validation check was added to `handleFormSubmit`: `if (formData?.login_data?.isContinueButtonVisible && !formData?.login_data?.primary_button_text) { message.error('Emtpy button details are not allowed') return }`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 18:48:04 - 29/10/2025, 19:03:58**
        *   This component renders a mobile UI preview based on active tabs (brand, login, payments, checkoutElement, address, coupons).
        *   It fetches `customizeUiData` from Redux and manages local state for `activeTab`, `trustBannerData`, `recommendedOffers`, `couponScreen`, and `discountArray`.
        *   The component dynamically renders content based on `activeTab`, showing different preview elements for brand, login, payments, and coupons.
        *   It displays a `Carousel` for banners on login/payment tabs, with `autoplaySpeed` driven by `customizeUiData`.
        *   Conditional rendering for coupon-related elements (Input for code, available offers with skeleton loaders).
        *   Conditional rendering for `checkoutElementData?.trust_banner_data`.
        *   No significant functional code changes are observed within these timestamps, mainly whitespace and perhaps reformatting, as the code block remains largely identical across these logs.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 21:03:41**
        *   This file defines a `RenderForm` component responsible for rendering various form fields for different configurations (custom, ABC webhook, merchant).
        *   It includes a `MaxRedeemableEasyRewardsTooltip` for detailed information on reward point capping.
        *   Various `Alert` messages are defined for EDD (Estimated Delivery Date) and PIN code serviceability, often with links to relevant settings pages.
        *   The `loyaltyInputs` array defines form fields related to loyalty program configurations, including switches for COD with loyalty, stacking with discounts, auto-application, custom display name, and showing earned loyalty points. It also includes rules for loyalty point calculation and sales channel control.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 30/10/2025, 10:46:02**
        *   This component manages different shipping settings tabs (Shipping Method, Product Based Shipping, Weight Based Shipping, Discount Based Shipping).
        *   It uses `useMerchantConfigApi` to fetch and save merchant configurations related to shipping.
        *   The `tabsList` array dynamically renders `ShippingMethodConfig`, `ProductBasedShipping`, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, and `DiscountBaseShipping` components.
        *   A conditional rendering logic for `finalTabListFilter` shows only 'Shipping Method' if `shippingPriceObject` is empty, otherwise shows all tabs.
    *   **Timestamp: 30/10/2025, 10:49:18**
        *   The "Product Based Shipping" tab was made conditionally rendered, appearing only if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is enabled.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 30/10/2025, 10:53:28 - 30/10/2025, 11:00:27**
        *   This component handles configuration for individual shipping methods, including their name, price, and order value limits.
        *   It integrates with customer segments, and provides functionality for uploading CSV files (e.g., for pincodes) and downloading existing ones.
        *   Validation logic is present for ensuring unique shipping names and correct range values.
        *   The upload logic includes getting a pre-signed URL and uploading the CSV data to AWS. No functional changes are observable, primarily whitespace and formatting changes over these timestamps.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 30/10/2025, 17:52:43**

        *   The `uploadDiscountCSV` function handles uploading a ZIP of CSV files to a pre-signed URL.
        *   A `debounce` function (`handleChange`) is used for live validation of input fields.
        *   `initialValues` for form fields are set, including a default `ends_at` to 3 months in the future.
    *   **Timestamp: 30/10/2025, 18:19:56 - 30/10/2025, 18:30:51**
        *   In `uploadDiscountCSV`, the `includeUserIdHeader` in `makeAWSPutCall` was changed from `true` to `false`.
        *   Later, the entire `makeAWSPutCall` section in `uploadDiscountCSV` was commented out and a `console.log("upload")` added, indicating a temporary halt or debug for the actual upload mechanism.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 30/10/2025, 18:29:20**

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **29/10/2025, 17:30:43**: ProductBasedShipping.tsx - Activation of `saveConfig` and state resets.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:04:43**: customize-ui/index.ts - Addition of `is_consent_auto_select: true` to login data.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:27:00**: loginPage.tsx - Renaming `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible` and updating its usage.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:39:37**: loginPage.tsx - Refactoring Consent Section to use `BannerComponentRendrer` and moving description.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:44:05**: loginPage.tsx - Introduction of `is_consent_auto_select` switch in Consent Section.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:58:39**: loginPage.tsx - Added validation for empty primary button text.
*   **30/10/2025, 10:49:18**: shippingBasedService.tsx - Product Based Shipping tab made conditionally visible.
*   **30/10/2025, 18:19:56**: createBulkDiscounts.tsx - Changed `includeUserIdHeader` to `false` in S3 upload.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:05:43**: shippingBasedData.tsx - Disabled logic for preventing selection of already mapped shipping IDs.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:09:53**: productBasaedShipping.tsx - Modified `product_based_rules` update to append new rules, conditional deletion of rules.
*   **01/11/2025, 12:04:22**: productBasaedShipping.tsx - Refined logic for deleting specific product-based rules from an array.
*   **03/11/2025, 16:19:20**: validations.ts - Added validation for "different freebie products for tiers with common ranges" in `validateTieredDiscount`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **`useMerchantConfigApi` hook**: Frequently used across `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `loginPage.tsx`, and `tieredDiscounts.tsx` for fetching, loading, refetching, and saving merchant configurations, indicating a centralized configuration management system.
*   **`gokwik-ui-kit` components**: Extensive use of UI components like `Button`, `Card`, `Col`, `Drawer`, `Form`, `message`, `Row`, `Table`, `Input`, `Switch`, `DatePicker`, `Radio`, `Select`, `Tooltip`, `Upload` from a custom UI library, suggesting a standardized frontend.
*   **Form Management**: `Form.useForm()` and `Form.useWatch()` are heavily utilized for form state management and real-time updates/validations.
*   **Conditional Rendering**: Many components, especially in UI customization and shipping settings, use conditional rendering (`if`, `? :`) to display different elements or tabs based on state or configuration values.
*   **API Interactions**: `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` from `@gokwik/utilities` are common for interacting with backend APIs, often involving presigned URLs for file uploads (e.g., CSV for bulk discounts or pincodes).
*   **Redux for State Management**: `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch` are used in several components (e.g., `loginPage.tsx`, `mobilePage.tsx`, `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`) to interact with a Redux store, specifically for `customize-ui` and `user` data.
*   **Validation Logic**: Dedicated `validate*` functions (e.g., `validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`) are used to enforce business rules on form submissions, preventing invalid data from being saved.
*   **Shipping Configuration Complexity**: Both `productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `shippingBasedData.tsx` show intricate logic for managing shipping rules, including mapping products/collections, handling different calculation methods, and dealing with conflicting/overlapping rules.
*   **UI Customization**: The `customizeUI` folder indicates a focus on allowing merchants to tailor the checkout experience, with specific attention to login page elements like banners, CTA text, and consent sections.
*   **Debugging with `console.log`**: Repeated addition and removal/commenting of `console.log` statements in `productBasaedShipping.tsx` suggests active debugging and iterative development.

## 11:43:22
The provided logs detail recent development activity across several UI-related files, primarily focusing on shipping settings, UI customization for login pages, and bulk discount creation. The timestamps indicate all changes occurred between October 29, 2025, and November 4, 2025.

### File-Specific Updates:

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`
(Multiple changes between 29/10/2025, 17:25:08 and 01/11/2025, 12:04:22)

This file manages product-based shipping rules. The changes primarily revolve around the `handleFormSubmit` function and the `useEffect` hook:
- **Initial Changes (29/10/2025, 17:25:08 - 29/10/2025, 17:27:06):** Focus was on refining the logic for processing form values, particularly when updating existing shipping rules. This included identifying and deleting existing `product_based_rules` before applying new ones, and handling default values for `price_multiplier` and `combine_with_weight_based` if not explicitly set. `console.log` statements were temporarily added for debugging.
- **Form Submission Logic Refinement (29/10/2025, 17:30:43 - 29/10/2025, 17:32:12):** The commented-out `saveConfig`, `setItemsData`, `setModalOpen`, and `form.resetFields` calls within `handleFormSubmit` were uncommented, indicating the feature moved towards active functionality for saving changes, clearing form data, and closing the modal.
- **Debugging and Logic for `shippingPrices` (30/10/2025, 10:35:02 - 30/10/2025, 10:36:15):** A `console.log(shippingPrices)` was added within the `useEffect` hook to inspect the `shippingPrices` state, suggesting further debugging or verification of data loading.
- **Further Refinement of `handleFormSubmit` for Updates (31/10/2025, 23:09:53 - 01/11/2025, 12:04:22):** The logic for updating `targetedShipping.product_based_rules` was changed from `targetedShipping.product_based_rules = [formValues]` to `targetedShipping.product_based_rules = [...(targetedShipping?.product_based_rules || []), formValues]`. This indicates a shift from overwriting an array of rules to appending a new rule to an existing array, which suggests support for multiple product-based rules per shipping ID. Additionally, within the `if (open && previousShippingId)` block, the handling of `deleteProductShipping.product_based_rules` was made more robust to account for cases with one or multiple rules, explicitly filtering and deleting a matching rule based on `formValues.name`. A `console.log` was temporarily re-added for debugging. A specific change was observed to `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]` which implies an attempt to remove a specific rule from an array by index after filtering. The condition `if (formValues?.shipping_id && 'shipping_id' in formValues)` was added to safely delete `shipping_id` from `formValues`.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`
(Multiple changes between 29/10/2025, 17:29:02 and 01/11/2025, 12:16:10)

This file contains the core logic for processing product-based shipping data for display and form fields.
- **Dropdown Options Logic (29/10/2025, 17:29:02):** The `selectedOptions` `useMemo` hook was introduced. This memoized function generates options for a dropdown, ensuring that only unused shipping IDs are available for selection when adding a new rule, or the currently selected ID when editing.
- **Removal of `disabled` property for `selectedOptions` (31/10/2025, 23:05:43 - 01/11/2025, 12:16:10):** The `disabled` property in the `selectedOptions` map function was commented out. This change likely removes a restriction, allowing all shipping IDs to be selectable regardless of whether they are already associated with a rule.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`
(Multiple changes between 29/10/2025, 18:04:43 and 29/10/2025, 18:27:17)

This Redux slice manages UI customization data.
- **Initial Login Data Updates (29/10/2025, 18:04:43):** Added `is_ isContinueButtonVisible` to `login_data` in `initialState`.
- **Consent Auto-select Feature (29/10/2025, 18:05:03):** Introduced `is_consent_auto_select: true` to the `login_data` object in `initialState`.
- **Consent Visibility Update (29/10/2025, 18:27:17):** Changed `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible` in `login_data` within `initialState`.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`
(Multiple changes between 29/10/2025, 18:09:05 and 03/11/2025, 11:41:24)

This component handles the UI customization for the login page.
- **Initial Refinements (29/10/2025, 18:09:05):** Set `banner_timer` default to 4 seconds, used `RenderField` for form fields, and added validation for empty banner/consent text.
- **Reorganization of Primary Button Controls (29/10/2025, 18:17:05 - 29/10/2025, 18:19:02):** The Primary Button's CTA Text switch and description were moved into a `RenderField` component, and later into a custom field within the `fields` array. This consolidates rendering logic.
- **Styling Adjustments (29/10/2025, 18:19:30 - 29/10/2025, 18:21:54):** Minor styling adjustments were made to the `p` tag within the Primary Button's field, changing `text-gray-500` to `font-light text-gray-500` and then back to just `text-gray-500`, and `font-normal` was added to `w-full`. These are cosmetic tweaks.
- **Consolidating Consent Section into `fields` (29/10/2025, 18:26:23):** The "Consent Section" `RenderEditorFunction` was moved from a separate `<Card>` directly into the `fields` array, similar to the banner and primary button. This streamlines the form structure.
- **Renaming `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible` (29/10/2025, 18:27:00):** The state property `is_consent_required` was renamed to `isConsentVisible` in both `initialValues` and throughout the component. This aligns with the Redux slice update.
- **Introducing `BannerComponentRendrer` for Consent Section (29/10/2025, 18:39:37):** The `RenderEditorFunction` for the Consent Section was replaced with `BannerComponentRendrer`, and logic was added to display this component conditionally based on `loginFormData?.isConsentVisible`.
- **Auto-select Consent Feature Implementation (29/10/2025, 18:44:05 - 29/10/2025, 18:46:01):** A new switch for `is_consent_auto_select` was added to the Consent Section, along with a descriptive paragraph, allowing merchants to pre-select the offers and updates consent box. Initial value set to `true`.
- **Form Submission Validation (29/10/2025, 18:58:39):** Added a validation rule to `handleFormSubmit` to check if `primary_button_text` is empty when `isContinueButtonVisible` is enabled, preventing empty button text.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`
(Multiple changes between 29/10/2025, 18:48:04 and 04/11/2025, 10:41:02)

This component provides a mobile preview of UI customizations.
- **Minor cosmetic and structural adjustments:** The logs show multiple small changes to whitespace, indentation, and potentially self-closing tags. These appear to be formatting or minor refactoring adjustments rather than functional changes. The overall structure and functionality remain consistent across these timestamps.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`
(Changed on 29/10/2025, 21:03:41)

This file defines a component for rendering various form fields, particularly for loyalty programs.
- **Loyalty Program Fields:** Introduced several new fields for configuring loyalty programs, including switches for `enable_cod_with_loyalty`, `enable_discount_with_credits`, `enable_auto_apply_credits`, and `enable_earned_loyalty_points`. Also added input for `loyalty_display_name` and selectors for `loyalty_sales_channel` and `on_field` for loyalty points calculation. Tooltips (`QuestionCircleOutlined`) were added to explain these new fields.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`
(Multiple changes between 30/10/2025, 07:53:01 and 03/11/2025, 15:54:21)

This is an EJS template file for configuring the dashboard UI, specifically managing import maps for different deployment environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).
- **Environment URL Updates:** The URLs for `@gokwik/utilities`, `@gokwik/payment`, `@gokwik/kwikpass`, `@gokwik/rto`, `@gokwik/kwikship`, `@gokwik/ellora`, `@gokwik/checkout-platform`, and `@gokwik/shopify-app` were updated in the `isLocal` and `sandbox` environment blocks to point to different `.gokwik.in` subdomains (e.g., `qa.gokwik.in` changed to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` for some, or `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` for others). This indicates changes in where these micro-frontends are hosted for different development/testing stages.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`
(Multiple changes between 30/10/2025, 10:46:02 and 30/10/2025, 10:49:18)

This file defines the main shipping service component with tabs for different shipping configurations.
- **Conditional Product Based Shipping Tab:** The "Product Based Shipping" tab (key '2') was made conditional. It will now only render if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is truthy, indicating that this feature might be gated or enabled based on a specific configuration.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`
(Multiple changes between 30/10/2025, 10:53:28 and 30/10/2025, 11:00:27)

This file manages the configuration of individual shipping methods.
- **Minor Changes to Upload Component:** Small, incremental changes to the `Inputs` object, specifically within the `itemRender` and `beforeUpload` functions for file uploads. These appear to be minor refinements related to styling, removing actions, and error handling for CSV file validation during pincode upload. No significant functional changes detected across these commits.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`
(Multiple changes between 30/10/2025, 17:52:43 and 30/10/2025, 18:30:51)

This component handles the creation of bulk discounts.
- **AWS S3 Upload `includeUserIdHeader` Fix:** The `includeUserIdHeader` parameter in `makeAWSPutCall` was changed from `true` to `false` for uploading discount CSVs to S3. This suggests that the AWS S3 endpoint might not require or properly handle the User ID header for these specific uploads, or there was a security/authentication change. Some `awsResponse` calls were temporarily commented out for debugging.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`
(Changed on 30/10/2025, 18:29:20)

This file contains API mapping logic for discounts.
- **Product Comparison Logic:** Introduced a new `compareProductArrays` function to efficiently determine which products/variants need to be added or removed when mapping discount configurations. This function handles `productData`, `variantData`, `productsToAdd`, `productsToRemove`, `productVariantsToAdd`, and `productVariantsToRemove`. This indicates a more sophisticated approach to managing product/variant associations for discounts.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/tieredDiscounts.tsx`
(Changed on 03/11/2025, 16:16:44)

This component manages tiered discount configurations.
- **Payment Method Filtering:** Updated `paymentMethods` `useMemo` to exclude 'cod' and 'ppcod-upi' methods from prepaid discounts, as prepaid discounts should not apply to cash-on-delivery options. This enforces business logic for discount applicability.
- **Discount Type Logic:** Refined the `tieredDiscountAddition` function to handle `Freebie` discount types differently, specifically deleting `value` and setting `capping_limit` to `null` for freebies, and setting `discount_rule` to `null` for non-freebie discounts. This implies distinct data structures or processing for different discount types.
- **Upper Limit Handling:** Normalized `upper_limit` and `capping_limit` to 'MAX' if they were previously `null` when updating discount configurations, indicating a standardization of how these limits are stored.

#### `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`
(Changed on 03/11/2025, 16:19:20)

This file contains validation functions for various discount types.
- **Tiered Discount Validation for Freebies:** Added a new validation rule to `validateTieredDiscount` to prevent selecting different freebie products for tiers that have overlapping ranges, ensuring consistency for free gift offers.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

- **UI Customization:** A significant portion of the changes across `loginPage.tsx` and `customize-ui/index.ts` focuses on enhancing the UI customization capabilities for checkout pages, specifically regarding banners, CTA text, and consent sections.
- **Shipping Configuration Complexity:** Updates to `productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `shippingBasedData.tsx` show an evolution towards more granular control over shipping rules, including per-product/collection rules and advanced conditions.
- **Form Management:** Extensive use of `Form.useForm()`, `Form.useWatch()`, `form.setFieldsValue()`, and `form.getFieldsValue()` from `gokwik-ui-kit` (likely Ant Design derivative) for state management within forms is evident.
- **Data Fetching and State Management:** `useMerchantConfigApi` and Redux (via `useAppDispatch`, `useSelector`) are consistently used for fetching, saving, and managing configuration data. `useState` and `useEffect` are fundamental for component-level state and side effects.
- **API Interactions:** `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` are frequently used for interacting with backend services, including presigned URLs for file uploads.
- **Error Handling and Messaging:** `message.error()` is consistently used to provide user feedback on validation failures or API errors.
- **Debugging Practices:** Temporary `console.log` statements appear in multiple logs, indicating active debugging during development.
- **Environment Configuration:** The `index.ejs` file shows a pattern of managing different service URLs based on deployment environments (`isLocal`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).
- **Date Handling:** `dayjs` is used for date manipulation, particularly for setting expiry dates for discounts.

## 11:43:24
The `Dockerfile` for the `mint-dashboard` application underwent several updates. Initially, on 28/10/2025 between 12:27:10 and 12:29:42, the Dockerfile content remained consistent, setting up a Node.js 20 Alpine base image, defining the working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package.json`, installing dependencies with `npm install -f`, copying the source code, generating Prisma schema, building, exposing port 3000, and starting the application. A notable change occurred on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21, where the `npm install -f` command was modified to `npm install`, removing the force flag.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` saw several iterations focused on email reporting functionality. On 03/11/2025 at 17:38:44, the file was introduced, featuring a `POST` endpoint to save PNG report data (daily or weekly) into a database, and functions (`sendDailyReport`, `sendWeeklyReport`, `sendEmailForReport`) designed to fetch, format, and send these reports via `nodemailer`. The `sendEmailForReport` function was initially configured to send emails from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co". Soon after, on 03/11/2025 at 17:39:41, the sender email address in `sendEmailForReport` was updated from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in". The final logged change for this file on 03/11/2025 at 18:12:32 involved adding a `console.log(res)` statement within the `sendEmailForReport` function, specifically after the `transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)` call, indicating a new addition for logging the email sending response. The file also contains commented-out `node-cron` schedules, suggesting that automated triggering of daily and weekly reports is a feature under consideration or development, but not actively enabled in the current code.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The `Dockerfile` entries indicate a stable build process with a single functional refinement to dependency installation.
*   The `app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file shows a rapid succession of minor adjustments on the same day (03/11/2025), primarily refining the email sending process by adjusting the sender's email address and adding debugging/logging.
*   The application uses Node.js, likely Next.js (given `NextRequest`/`NextResponse`), and Prisma for database interactions. It also integrates `nodemailer` for email functionality and `date-fns` for date formatting.
*   There is a clear focus on generating and emailing daily and weekly reports that include images, suggesting a dashboard or reporting tool.
*   Timestamps show activity clustered around two distinct periods: late October 2025 for infrastructure (Dockerfile) and early November 2025 for feature development (email reporting).

## 12:43:18
The `Dockerfile` for the `mint-dashboard` project saw minor changes primarily on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. Prior to this, on 28/10/2025, several timestamps (12:27:10, 12:27:41, 12:29:42) showed identical Dockerfile content, establishing a consistent build process: using `node:20-alpine`, setting `/app` as the working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package.json` for caching, installing dependencies, copying source code, generating Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and finally starting the application.

The `/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file underwent several updates on 03/11/2025.
*   Initially at 17:38:44, this file was established to handle email sending functionality for daily and weekly reports. It includes a POST endpoint to save image data and report metadata, and a GET endpoint that triggers `sendDailyReport()`. The core logic involves `nodemailer` for sending emails, `date-fns` for date formatting, and utilizes backend queries to fetch and store report data. It also includes commented-out `node-cron` schedules for daily and weekly report triggers, indicating planned automation. The initial sender email address was configured as `integration-noreply@gokwik.co`.
*   A subsequent change at 17:39:41 modified the sender email address within the `sendEmailForReport` function from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
*   Finally, at 18:12:32, a `console.log(res)` statement was added immediately after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` within the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely for debugging or logging the outcome of email transmission.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Docker Environment:** The `Dockerfile` consistently defines a Node.js 20 Alpine environment, highlighting a stable base for the application.
*   **Focus on Email Reporting:** The significant activity in `app/api/sendemail/route.ts` demonstrates a strong focus on generating and sending daily/weekly reports via email, involving image attachments.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Changes in the email sending logic (sender address, logging) suggest active development and debugging efforts around the email functionality.
*   **Planned Automation:** The commented-out `node-cron` schedules indicate an intention to automate the daily and weekly report generation and sending processes in the future.

## 12:43:51
The logs show a series of updates across the `checkout-dashboard-ui` and `dashboard-ui-configuration` projects, primarily focusing on UI customization, shipping settings, and discount management. The changes occurred between October 29, 2025, and November 4, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
    *   Between **October 29, 2025, 17:30:43** and **October 30, 2025, 11:01:12**, initial component logic was established and refined. This included handling form submissions for product-based shipping rules, setting default values for `price_multiplier` and `combine_with_weight_based`, and managing state for `shippingPrices` and `itemsData`. Minor debugging `console.log` statements were added and subsequently removed.
    *   From **October 31, 2025, 23:09:53** to **November 1, 2025, 12:04:22**, significant changes were made to the `handleFormSubmit` function. Initially, `targetedShipping.product_based_rules` was updated by overwriting it; this was changed to append new rules using a spread operator (`...`). Conditional deletion logic for `product_based_rules` based on `previousShippingId` and array length was introduced and refined. A temporary commenting out of the `saveConfig` call for debugging was observed, which was later re-enabled on **October 31, 2025, 23:47:40**. Minor refinements to the deletion logic and name comparison (using `.trim()`) were also applied.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   On **October 29, 2025, 18:05:03**, a new property `is_consent_auto_select: true` was added to `login_data` in the Redux initial state, and `is_isContinueButtonVisible` was renamed to `isContinueButtonVisible`.
    *   On **October 29, 2025, 18:27:17**, `is_consent_required` was renamed to `isConsentVisible` within the `login_data` state structure.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
    *   Between **October 29, 2025, 18:09:05** and **October 29, 2025, 18:23:38**, the UI elements for Banner, Primary Button, and Consent Section were progressively refactored. Initially, some elements were manually rendered, but they were moved into a dynamic `fields` array, and each field was wrapped in a `Card` component. Styling classes and descriptive text were also adjusted.
    *   On **October 29, 2025, 18:27:00**, `is_consent_required` was consistently updated to `isConsentVisible` across initial values, form fields, and validation logic, aligning with the Redux store change.
    *   From **October 29, 2025, 18:39:37** to **October 29, 2025, 18:46:01**, the Consent Section's rendering logic was enhanced. `RenderEditorFunction` was replaced with a custom render block incorporating a `Switch` for `isConsentVisible` and `BannerComponentRendrer`. A new switch for `is_consent_auto_select` was introduced, along with its description and initial value.
    *   On **October 29, 2025, 18:58:39**, a new validation rule was added to `handleFormSubmit` to ensure that if `isContinueButtonVisible` is enabled, the `primary_button_text` cannot be empty.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   From **October 29, 2025, 18:48:04** to **November 4, 2025, 10:41:02**, this component primarily serves as a mobile preview of checkout UI. It uses Redux state (`customizeUiData`) to dynamically render brand logos, banners, and payment stage indicators. The `useEffect` hook manages the active tab display based on props. Despite multiple timestamps, no significant code changes were visually identifiable in the provided logs for this file, suggesting minor re-saves or formatting adjustments.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**
    *   On **October 29, 2025, 21:03:41**, a component for rendering various integration and loyalty settings was introduced or significantly updated. It defines extensive form inputs for loyalty programs, including options for COD with loyalty, stacking with manual discounts, auto-application of credits, custom reward point names, and earned loyalty points display rules. Tooltips are extensively used for providing context and information for these fields.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 07:53:01**, changes were made to the SystemJS import map, updating URLs for several `@gokwik` modules (e.g., `utilities`, `dashboard`, `payment`, `kwikpass`) to point to `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` or `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` based on the deployment environment. The `dev` and `qa` environments also saw the addition of `@gokwik/kwikcomm`.
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 16:50:46**, some `isLocal` environment URLs were adjusted, specifically `@gokwik/utilities` now points to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
    *   On **October 31, 2025, 23:02:32**, the `utilities` URL for the `isLocal` environment was updated to `https://qa.gokwik.in`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
    *   Between **October 30, 2025, 10:02:10** and **October 30, 2025, 10:34:46**, the component was initialized with state management for `itemsData` and `previousShippingId`. It includes logic for mapping product/collection data, dynamically generating `selectedOptions` for shipping IDs, and defining table columns for item display. Product/collection search and addition/removal functionality are implemented. No significant functional changes were observed across these timestamps, suggesting minor re-saves.
    *   On **October 31, 2025, 23:05:43**, the `disabled` property in the `selectedOptions` memoization was commented out, which means that all shipping IDs are now selectable, regardless of whether they are already in use.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 10:46:02**, this component was updated to include `ProductBasedShipping` as a new tab within its shipping configuration interface.
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 10:49:18**, the "Product Based Shipping" tab was made conditionally visible, only appearing if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is truthy.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   From **October 30, 2025, 10:53:28** to **October 30, 2025, 11:00:27**, this component handles advanced configuration for shipping methods, including form fields for naming, pricing, and order value ranges. It incorporates functionality for uploading pincode CSV files, performing validations, and integrating with customer segments. No significant code changes were visibly made across these timestamps, indicating minor re-saves or internal tooling actions.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 17:52:43**, the component for creating bulk discounts was updated, including logic for validating discount codes, generating random codes with prefixes/suffixes, and handling CSV file uploads. The `makeAWSPutCall` was initially commented out.
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 18:19:56**, the file upload logic was changed from a commented `makeAWSPutCall` to a direct `fetch` call, removing `includeUserIdHeader: true`.
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 18:25:19**, the `fetch` call for file upload was re-commented, indicating a temporary disablement or mock behavior.
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 18:25:34**, the `makeAWSPutCall` for file upload was uncommented and `includeUserIdHeader` was set to `true`, re-enabling the AWS S3 upload functionality.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   On **October 30, 2025, 18:29:20**, this file was significantly updated to include various utility functions for discount management. Key additions include `customerEligibility` mapping, `assignMatchType` for discount code identifiers, `editCollectionId` for Shopify collection IDs, and several mapping functions (`mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`, `responseMapCollections`, `responseMapProducts`) for transforming product and collection data. Crucially, validation functions (`validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, `validateBuyXatYDiscount`, `validateDiscountCapping`, `validateGWP`) were also added.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
    *   On **November 3, 2025, 16:19:20**, a new validation rule was implemented in `validateTieredDiscount`. This rule prevents the selection of different freebie products for tiered discounts that have overlapping order value ranges, ensuring consistency in free gift offerings.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`**
    *   On **November 3, 2025, 11:41:24**, a new component `FreeGift` was introduced or substantially updated. It provides a UI for configuring automatic free gift rules, including fields for rule names, sales channels, purchase requirements (cart value or quantity), minimum/maximum values, and selection of specific products or collections for the gift. The component supports adding, editing, and deleting these rules, and integrates with a `ProductSearch` component.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/tieredDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   On **November 3, 2025, 16:16:44**, this component was updated to manage tiered discounts. It processes discount configurations, separates them by payment method (e.g., handling "cc" and "dc" variants), and provides functionality to add, delete, and edit tiered discounts. It also includes logic to validate new discounts to prevent overlaps or invalid data. The component uses a `Table` to display existing discounts, with options for editing values directly in the table.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   On **November 4, 2025, 12:02:47**, the `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was introduced, allowing asynchronous fetching of product variant or collection details by their IDs using a POST request. This function processes the API response to map data into a structured format, grouping product variants by product ID and providing collection details.
    *   No significant changes were observed in subsequent timestamps for this file on **November 4, 2025**.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   On **November 4, 2025, 12:03:46**, two new API endpoints, `/api/dashboard/product/get-variant-details` (`getVariantById`) and `/api/dashboard/collection/get-collection-details` (`getCollectionById`), were added to support fetching detailed product variant and collection information by ID.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **UI Component Refactoring:** Many changes, particularly in `loginPage.tsx`, indicate a pattern of consolidating UI elements into reusable `fields` arrays and dynamic rendering components (`RenderField`, `RenderEditorFunction`, `BannerComponentRendrer`). This suggests an effort towards more modular and data-driven UI construction.
2.  **Configuration Management:** There's a strong emphasis on managing merchant configurations, especially for shipping rules (`shipping-settings`) and UI customization (`customizeUI`). This involves fetching, saving, and validating configuration data through dedicated API calls and Redux state management.
3.  **Data Transformation and Validation:** Several utility functions (`mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`, `validateTieredDiscount`, etc.) are being developed to preprocess and validate data before it's sent to APIs or displayed in the UI, ensuring data integrity and user experience.
4.  **Dynamic UI and Conditional Rendering:** Components frequently use `useState` and `useEffect` to manage active tabs, modal visibility, and dynamic display of form elements or information based on user interaction or configuration data (e.g., showing the "Product Based Shipping" tab only if a specific service is enabled).
5.  **Environment Configuration:** The repeated changes to `dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` show a pattern of actively managing and switching between different deployment environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox) by updating module URLs and including/excluding features. This also aligns with the `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` changes in the `.env` file, though the `.env` file itself is excluded from the summary per instructions.
6.  **Error Handling and User Feedback:** The code consistently uses `message.error()` for displaying validation errors and API call failures, providing immediate feedback to the user.
7.  **Usage of External Libraries and Hooks:** Reliance on `@library` components, `@store` for Redux, and custom hooks like `useMerchantConfigApi` is prevalent, indicating a well-structured application using a component-based architecture and centralized state management.

## 13:43:15
The `mint-dashboard` project saw changes primarily in its Dockerfile and email sending logic.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   Between October 28th and 29th, 2025, the Dockerfile, which defines the build environment for the Node.js application, remained largely consistent.
    *   A notable change occurred on **29/10/2025 at 23:35:21**, where the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This suggests a shift from forcefully installing dependencies to a standard installation, potentially indicating a move away from resolving peer dependency conflicts aggressively or a change in best practices. The Dockerfile uses `node:20-alpine`, sets `/app` as the working directory, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` for caching, installs dependencies, copies source code, generates Prisma schema, builds the app, exposes port 3000, and starts the application.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**:
    *   This file handles the logic for saving image report data and sending daily/weekly email reports using `nodemailer`.
    *   On **03/11/2025 at 17:38:44**, the initial version was logged, featuring a POST endpoint to save report images and a GET endpoint to trigger daily reports. It included commented-out `node-cron` schedules for daily and weekly reports, suggesting future or planned automation.
    *   A minor update on **03/11/2025 at 17:39:41** changed the sender email address in `sendEmailForReport` from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
    *   Later on **03/11/2025 at 18:12:32**, a debugging line `console.log(res)` was added after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` in the `sendEmailForReport` function to log the email sending response.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**: Dockerfile `npm install -f` command changed to `npm install`.
*   **03/11/2025, 17:39:41**: Sender email domain updated in `sendemail/route.ts`.
*   **03/11/2025, 18:12:32**: Debugging `console.log` added to email sending function.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

*   The project consistently uses Node.js 20 Alpine as the base image for Docker builds.
*   Prisma is used for database interactions, indicated by `npx prisma generate`.
*   Email functionality (sending daily/weekly reports as PNG images) is a core feature, relying on `nodemailer` and environment variables for configuration.
*   There's a recurring pattern of `node-cron` usage (though commented out for scheduling in the provided log) for automating report generation and sending, along with helper functions like `getCurrentDate` and `getPreviousDate`.
*   Error handling with `try...catch` blocks and `console.error` is present in the `sendemail/route.ts` file.

## 13:44:18
The code changes log spans from October 29, 2025, to November 04, 2025, indicating an active development period focused on UI customization and various configuration settings within a checkout dashboard application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation & Refinements (Oct 29, 17:30 - Oct 30, 11:01):** This file, responsible for product-based shipping rules, was initially committed, including logic for form submission, modal management, and validation for product/collection selections. Minor changes involved adding and then removing `console.log` statements for debugging.
    *   **Major Logic Changes (Oct 31, 23:09 onwards):**
        *   The way `product_based_rules` are updated was significantly changed. Instead of overwriting, new `formValues` are now appended to existing rules (`[...(targetedShipping?.product_based_rules || []),formValues]`), allowing for multiple rules per shipping ID.
        *   The logic for deleting product-based shipping rules during an edit (`if (open && previousShippingId)`) underwent several iterations. It evolved from a simple `delete` operation on `product_based_rules` to a more complex conditional check: if there's only one rule, the `product_based_rules` property is deleted; if there are multiple, it attempts to filter for a matching rule by name and then `delete` a specific entry, which was refined to `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]`.
        *   Form saving functionality (`saveConfig`, `setItemsData`, etc.) was temporarily commented out for debugging (Oct 31, 23:19, 23:20, 23:26) and later reinstated (Oct 31, 23:47).
        *   A `formValues?.shipping_id` check was added before deleting `shipping_id` from `formValues`.
        *   The `selectedOptions` memoized function in `shippingBasedData.tsx` (which is imported by this file) was modified to always enable all shipping ID options, regardless of prior usage, by commenting out the `disabled` property logic (Oct 31, 23:05).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   **Configuration Schema Update (Oct 29, 18:04 - 18:05):** The `initialState` for `login_data` was updated. A typo `is_ isContinueButtonVisible` was corrected to `isContinueButtonVisible`, and a new property `is_consent_auto_select: true` was added, indicating a new UI customization option for automatic consent selection.
    *   **Schema Property Renaming (Oct 29, 18:27):** The `is_consent_required` property within `login_data` in `initialState` was renamed to `isConsentVisible`, reflecting a change in how consent visibility is tracked.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
    *   **UI Refactoring & Feature Additions (Oct 29, 18:09 onwards):**
        *   The component underwent significant refactoring to use a `fields` array for dynamic rendering of UI sections (Banner, Primary Button, Consent Section) via `RenderField`.
        *   The "Primary Button" section was initially refactored into a `switch` type field, then reverted to a `custom` type field where its entire rendering logic is handled internally (Oct 29, 18:23).
        *   Styling adjustments were made to text within the "Primary Button" label (Oct 29, 18:19 - 18:21).
        *   The "Consent Section" was also refactored from a direct `RenderEditorFunction` call to a `custom` field in the `fields` array (Oct 29, 18:26).
        *   The `is_consent_required` field was renamed to `isConsentVisible` to align with the store changes (Oct 29, 18:27).
        *   `BannerComponentRendrer` was introduced for rendering the "Consent Section Text", replacing the generic `RenderEditorFunction` for that specific part (Oct 29, 18:39).
        *   A new feature, "Auto-select offers and updates consent box on checkout" (`is_consent_auto_select`), was added to the "Consent Section" (Oct 29, 18:44) and its default value set in `initialValues` (Oct 29, 18:46).
        *   New validation was added to prevent empty primary button text if the "Continue" button is visible (Oct 29, 18:58).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **Conditional Tab Rendering (Oct 30, 10:49):** The "Product Based Shipping" tab in the `tabsList` was made conditionally visible, depending on `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service`. This suggests product-based shipping became an opt-in feature. Other changes in this file across the logs were minor or re-formats.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**
    *   **Loyalty & EDD Enhancements (Oct 29, 21:03):** This component received updates to its loyalty inputs, including fields for enabling COD with loyalty, stacking discounts, auto-applying credits, custom display names for reward points, and showing earned loyalty points based on subtotal or "To Pay" (with a tooltip about shipping charges not being considered). EDD and pincode alerts were also refined with action buttons linking to relevant settings.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **Dependency Management & Environment Configuration (Oct 30, 07:53 - Oct 31, 23:03):** This EJS template, which defines import maps for different deployment environments, saw several updates to the `@gokwik/utilities` dependency URL for local, QA, and sandbox environments. It toggled between `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` and `https://qa.gokwik.in` for the `isLocal` and `qa` environments. A `connect-src` CSP rule was updated to include `wss://*.gokwik.io`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **Bulk Discount Creation Logic (Oct 30, 17:52 - 18:25):**
        *   The `uploadDiscountCSV` function, which handles uploading ZIPs of CSV files, saw its `makeAWSPutCall` logic for actual file upload commented out and then reinstated (`includeUserIdHeader: false`), and then commented out again in rapid succession, suggesting active development or debugging of the upload mechanism. A `console.log("upload")` was added as a debugging placeholder.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   **Discount & Product Data Processing (Oct 30, 18:29):** This file received new functions for processing discount-related data. `fetchAllProductsByIds` was introduced to fetch product variant details, and `responseMapCollections` and `responseMapProducts` were added for mapping API responses to UI-friendly formats for collections and products, respectively. Existing validation functions (`validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, etc.) are present, suggesting a robust validation layer for discount configurations.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`**
    *   **Free Gift Settings (Nov 03, 11:41):** This new component introduces a comprehensive interface for configuring automatic free gift rules. It allows setting rules based on name, sales channels, purchase type (cart value or quantity), applicability (all/specific products/collections), free gift product selection, quantity, price, and application method (auto/selection). It integrates `ProductSearch` for item selection and includes standard table actions like edit and delete for managing rules.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/tieredDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **Tiered Discount Management (Nov 03, 16:16):** This component was updated to manage tiered prepaid discounts. It includes logic to filter payment methods (excluding COD options), handle additions and deletions of tiered discounts with validation, and save changes to the merchant configuration. The table displays details like payment method, discount code, type, order limits, value, freebies, RTO action dependency, and capping amount.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
    *   **Enhanced Discount Validations (Nov 03, 16:19):** The `validateTieredDiscount` function was enhanced to include a check for "different freebie for same range," preventing conflicting free gift offers within overlapping tiers. This indicates a focus on robust and specific validation for complex discount scenarios.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **API Enhancements (Nov 04, 12:02):** The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was modified to improve the handling of `product_thumbnail_url` when fetching variant details.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **New API Endpoints (Nov 04, 12:03):** Several new API endpoints were added for fetching variant and collection details (`getVariantById`, `getCollectionById`), and for GST data validation and setting (`validateGstData`, `setGstData`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI Customization Focus:** A strong pattern is the continuous enhancement of the checkout dashboard's UI customization capabilities, particularly for the login page and shipping settings.
*   **Form-Driven Development:** Extensive use of Ant Design's `Form` component for managing user inputs, state, and complex validations. `Form.useForm()`, `Form.useWatch()`, and message-based error handling (`message.error`) are prominent.
*   **State Management (React & Redux):** Consistent use of React's `useState` and Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) for managing component and global state.
*   **API Interaction Layer:** Frequent calls to `makeAPICall` indicate a standardized approach to interacting with backend services for fetching and saving configuration data.
*   **Conditional Feature Rollout:** The introduction of conditional rendering for features like "Product Based Shipping" and "Consent Auto-select" suggests a strategy for controlled feature deployments.
*   **Detailed Validation:** There's an emphasis on comprehensive validation logic for various configurations, especially for discount and shipping rules, to prevent conflicting or invalid settings.
*   **Iterative Refinement:** Multiple commits within short timeframes for the same file, including adding/removing `console.log`s and commenting out/reinstating code, indicate an iterative and debugging-heavy development workflow.
*   **Micro-frontend Architecture (implied by `index.ejs`):** The `index.ejs` file shows continuous updates to SystemJS import maps, pointing to different micro-frontends (`@gokwik/checkout`, `@gokwik/dashboard`, etc.) in various environments, confirming a modular application structure.
*   **Environment Configuration Management:** Regular updates to `.env` files and `index.ejs` to switch between development, QA, and sandbox environments.

## 14:43:27
The changes log details updates across two main files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard` project: a `Dockerfile` and an API route file, `/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`. No summary is provided for the `.env` file path as per instructions.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**
    *   Across several entries on **28/10/2025** (12:27:10, 12:27:41, 12:29:42), the `Dockerfile` maintained a consistent structure. It is set up to build a Node.js 20 Alpine application, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json` for dependency installation, copying the full source code, generating Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting with `npm start`.
    *   A significant change occurred on **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**, where the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`, removing the "force" flag from the `npm install` command.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**
    *   The file initially appeared on **03/11/2025, 17:38:44**. This file defines a Next.js API route (`POST` and `GET`) responsible for handling and sending daily and weekly email reports.
        *   The `POST` endpoint receives image data, header name, and report ID, saving it via `pngReportData` and returning a success message.
        *   It includes `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` functions that retrieve report data, format dates using `date-fns`, and call `sendEmailForReport` to dispatch emails. `sendDailyReport` also calls `deletepngReportData` after successful email sending.
        *   The `sendEmailForReport` function utilizes `nodemailer` to configure an SMTP transporter (using environment variables for host, port, user, pass) and send emails with embedded PNG images. The `from` email address was initially set to "integration-noreply@gokwik.co".
        *   The `GET` endpoint simply triggers the `sendDailyReport` function and returns a status indicating cron jobs are running.
        *   Commented-out `node-cron` scheduling logic is present, indicating a potential or past use of automated report triggers.
    *   On **03/11/2025, 17:39:41**, a minor update changed the sender email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in".
    *   Another update on **03/11/2025, 18:12:32**, added `console.log(res)` after the `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)` call within the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely for debugging email delivery responses.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Application Focus:** The changes indicate an active development cycle for a "mint-dashboard" application, focusing on both its deployment (Dockerfile) and a core feature: automated email reporting.
*   **Dependency Management:** The `Dockerfile` consistently manages Node.js dependencies and Prisma schema generation as part of its build process.
*   **Email Reporting Logic:** The `sendemail/route.ts` file demonstrates a structured approach to email reporting, including data persistence (`pngReportData`), report retrieval (`getPngReportByTodayDate`), dynamic content generation (report type, date, header), and email dispatch using `nodemailer` with embedded images.
*   **Use of Environment Variables:** The email sending functionality heavily relies on environment variables for sensitive configuration details (e.g., `EMAIL_HOST`, `SMTP_EMAIL`, `SMTP_PASS`, `PARENT_EMAIL`), suggesting a robust deployment strategy.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `date-fns` library is consistently used for date manipulation and formatting within the email reporting logic.

## 14:44:03
The provided log details code changes across multiple files within a `checkout-dashboard-ui` project, primarily focusing on shipping settings, UI customization, bulk discounts, and API utility functions. The timestamps range from October 29, 2025, to November 04, 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`** (29/10/2025 17:30:43 to 01/11/2025 12:04:22):
    *   **Initial setup:** The component `ProductBasedShipping` manages product-based shipping rules, using a form, state for shipping prices and modal visibility, and data processing from `processProductBasedShippingData`.
    *   **Form Submission Logic:** The `handleFormSubmit` function processes form values, validates product/collection selections, updates `targetedShipping` with `action: 'update'`, and adds `product_based_rules`. It also handles logic for `price_multiplier` and `combine_with_weight_based` defaults.
    *   **Rule Deletion Logic Refinements:** Several updates refined the logic for deleting `product_based_rules`. Initially, if `previousShippingId` exists, it would delete the `product_based_rules` array directly. Later changes introduced conditional deletion:
        *   If `product_based_rules` has a single item, the entire property is deleted.
        *   If it has multiple items, it attempts to filter and delete a matching rule based on `formValues.name`. This logic was further refined to `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]`, indicating an attempt to remove a specific item from the filtered array, which might be an incorrect manipulation as `delete` operator is for object properties.
    *   **`selectedOptions` logic:** A commented-out `disabled` property in the `selectedOptions` `useMemo` hook indicates a potential feature or bug fix related to enabling/disabling options based on whether a shipping ID is already used.
    *   **Console Logging:** A `console.log(shippingPrices)` was briefly added and then removed, suggesting debugging efforts.
    *   **Form Reset on Drawer Close:** Consistent logic to `form.resetFields()`, `setModalOpen(false)`, and `setItemsData([])` on drawer close.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`** (29/10/2025 18:04:43 to 29/10/2025 18:27:17):
    *   **Login Data Enhancements:** Added `is_consent_auto_select: true` to `login_data` in the `initialState`.
    *   **Consent Visibility:** Renamed `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible` in the `login_data` state, reflecting a change in how consent section visibility is managed.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`** (29/10/2025 18:09:05 to 29/10/2025 18:58:39):
    *   **Form Field Refactoring:** The component underwent significant refactoring regarding how form fields are rendered.
        *   Initially, 'Primary Button' and 'Consent Section' were rendered directly in the JSX.
        *   Later, a `fields` array was introduced, moving the 'Primary Button' section into a `type: 'switch'` field within this array.
        *   Further changes made both 'Primary Button' and 'Consent Section' `type: 'custom'` fields within the `fields` array, each wrapped in a `Card` component for consistent styling.
        *   The `RenderEditorFunction` for 'Consent Section' was replaced with `BannerComponentRendrer` and its visibility became conditional on `loginFormData?.isConsentVisible`.
    *   **Consent Auto-Select Feature:** Introduced a new switch for "Auto-select offers and updates consent box on checkout" with the `is_consent_auto_select` field.
    *   **Form Validation:** Added validation to `handleFormSubmit` to ensure `primary_button_text` is not empty if `isContinueButtonVisible` is enabled.
    *   **`is_consent_required` vs `isConsentVisible`:** The field name for consent visibility was updated from `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible` across the component, mirroring the Redux store change.
    *   **Styling Adjustments:** Minor CSS class changes, e.g., `font-light` was briefly added and removed from a paragraph describing the CTA text, and a `mt-2` class was added to a span for spacing.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`** (29/10/2025 18:48:04 to 04/11/2025 10:41:02):
    *   **No significant functional changes.** The provided code snippets for this file are identical across multiple timestamps, suggesting no relevant code modifications were made during these specific commits.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`** (29/10/2025 21:03:41):
    *   This file provides a component `RenderForm` for dynamically rendering form fields for various integrations, including loyalty programs, EDD, and pincode serviceability. It defines a `loyaltyInputs` array with fields for enabling COD with loyalty, stacking with manual discounts, auto-applying credits, custom display names for reward points, and showing/calculating earned loyalty points based on rules and sales channels.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`** (30/10/2025 07:53:01 to 31/10/2025 23:03:18):
    *   **Environment-Specific Module Loading:** Updates primarily involve changing the `deployedEnv` variable in the `systemjs-importmap` section. This controls which environment's (dev, qa, sandbox, production) dashboard micro-frontend URLs are loaded.
        *   2025-10-30 07:53:01: Configured for `qa`.
        *   2025-10-30 16:50:46: Changed to `sandbox` for local development.
        *   2025-10-31 23:02:32: Reverted back to `qa` for local development.
        *   2025-10-31 23:03:18: Minor change, `utilities` URL for `isLocal` moved from `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` to `https://qa.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`** (30/10/2025 10:02:10 to 01/11/2025 12:16:10):
    *   **`selectedOptions` Logic Change:** The `disabled` property within `selectedOptions` `useMemo` hook was commented out. This change effectively removes the logic that disables shipping options if they are already mapped to a shipping rule, allowing selection regardless of prior use.
    *   **Data Mapping for Items:** The `dataMapperForItems` function processes product and collection data for display in tables, converting IDs, setting image URLs, and handling variants.
    *   **Form Fields Structure:** Defines an array of form `fields` for creating/editing product-based shipping rules, including rule name, price, mapping to a shipping ID, calculation method (override/add), price multiplier, and weight-based combination. It also includes `ProductSearch` components for adding products and collections.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`** (30/10/2025 10:46:02 to 30/10/2025 10:49:18):

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`** (30/10/2025 17:52:43 to 30/10/2025 18:30:51):
    *   **AWS Upload Change:** A significant change was made in `uploadDiscountCSV`. The `makeAWSPutCall` utility was commented out and replaced with a direct `fetch` call for uploading the CSV file to a pre-signed S3 URL. This change was then reverted (or commented back in implicitly) by the end of the log.
    *   **`includeUserIdHeader` in `makeAWSPutCall`:** The `includeUserIdHeader` parameter in `makeAWSPutCall` was initially `true` then changed to `false` and then back to `true` across a few commits. This suggests a change in authentication requirements for S3 uploads.
    *   **Debugging Console Log:** A `console.log("upload")` was added, likely for debugging the upload process.
    *   **Code Generation Logic:** This component allows creating bulk discount codes either randomly or by uploading a CSV. It includes validation for discount sets, code generation rules (length, prefix, suffix), and expiry dates.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`** (30/10/2025 18:29:20):
    *   This file defines API request mapping and validation logic for various discount types, including tiered discounts, dynamic discounts, and buy-X-at-Y discounts. It also contains utility functions for mapping collections and products.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`** (03/11/2025 11:41:24):
    *   This component manages "Free Gift Settings", allowing the creation and management of free gift rules. It defines form fields for rule name, sales channels, purchase requirements (cart value/quantity), minimum/maximum values, applicable products/collections, free gift quantity/price, and application method (auto/selection).

3.  **Discount Management:** Features for bulk discounts, tiered discounts, and free gifts are being actively developed or refined, including validation, data mapping, and API interactions.
4.  **Form Management:** The use of `Form.useForm()` and `Form.useWatch()` from `gokwik-ui-kit` is prevalent across multiple components for state management and reactive form behavior.
5.  **State Management:** `useState` and Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) are consistently used for managing local and global application states.
6.  **API Interactions:** `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` from `@gokwik/utilities` are frequently used for interacting with backend services.
7.  **Data Transformation/Mapping:** Functions like `dataMapperForItems` and `requestMapDiscount` are common, indicating a need to transform data structures between UI forms and API payloads.
8.  **Error Handling and Validation:** `message.error` from `gokwik-ui-kit` is used for displaying user-friendly error messages, and dedicated validation functions (`validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, etc.) are in place.
9.  **Environmental Configuration:** The `index.ejs` file consistently updates `systemjs-importmap` to control micro-frontend loading based on deployment environment, switching between `dev`, `qa`, and `sandbox` URLs.
10. **Code Comments/Debugging:** Occasional `console.log` statements and commented-out code segments suggest active debugging and iterative development.
11. **Component-Based Development:** The project adheres to a component-based architecture, with distinct components handling specific features like `ProductBasedShipping`, `Login`, `TieredDiscounts`, etc.

## 15:43:19

The logs indicate changes across two distinct files: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`. Log entries pertaining to `.env` files, which may contain sensitive keys, have been excluded from this summary.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant change:** 29/10/2025, 23:35:21
    *   **Updates:** The Dockerfile underwent a minor but notable modification. Initial entries on 28/10/2025 consistently used `RUN npm install -f` for dependency installation. On 29/10/2025, this command was updated to `RUN npm install`. The rest of the Dockerfile remained consistent, including using `node:20-alpine` as the base image, setting the working directory to `/app`, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json`, generating Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting the application with `npm start`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps of significant changes:** 03/11/2025, 17:39:41 and 03/11/2025, 18:12:32
    *   **Updates:**
        *   Around 03/11/2025, 17:39:41, the sender email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function was modified. The `from` address for outgoing emails was changed from `"integration-noreply@gokwik.co"` to `"integration-noreply@gokwik.in"`.
        *   Around 03/11/2025, 18:12:32, a logging statement (`console.log(res)`) was added immediately after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` within the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely for debugging or monitoring email sending responses.
    *   **Content Patterns:** This file consistently implements an API route for handling and sending email reports. It uses `nodemailer` for email functionality, `date-fns` for date formatting, and integrates with a backend (`../../../backend/query` and `@/backend/backendservice`) for retrieving, saving, and deleting PNG report data. The code includes logic to save daily/weekly image data sent via POST requests and functions to send daily and weekly reports. Scheduled cron jobs for daily and weekly reports are present but commented out in all logged versions, indicating this feature might be disabled or under development. The email content includes an embedded PNG image, and the subject line is dynamically generated with the report type and date.

## 15:43:38
The provided logs indicate focused development on the checkout dashboard UI, primarily around customizing user interface elements, configuring shipping methods, and enhancing discount functionalities.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` (29/10/2025, 17:30:43 - 01/11/2025, 12:04:22):** This component for product-based shipping rules underwent significant iterations.

Subsequent updates focused on enhancing the `selectedOptions` calculation to prevent mapping to already used shipping IDs, and later, the `disabled` property in `selectedOptions` was commented out, potentially to allow re-selection or editing flexibility. The logic for deleting specific rules within `product_based_rules` was also refined to handle cases with single or multiple rules.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts` (29/10/2025, 18:04:43 - 29/10/2025, 18:27:17):** The Redux store for UI customization was updated. A new property, `is_consent_auto_select`, was introduced in `initialState.login_data`, and the `is_consent_required` property was renamed to `isConsentVisible`, reflecting a shift in how consent visibility is managed.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx` (29/10/2025, 18:09:05 - 29/10/2025, 18:58:39):** This page saw extensive UI refactoring. Elements like "Primary Button" and "Consent Section" were progressively moved into a `fields` array for dynamic rendering using `RenderField` components, leveraging `RenderEditorFunction` and introducing `BannerComponentRendrer`. New functionality for auto-selecting offers/updates consent box was added. Validation logic in `handleFormSubmit` was enhanced to check for empty banner/consent details and to ensure the primary button text is not empty if visible. Text styling for descriptions was also adjusted.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx` (29/10/2025, 18:48:04 - 04/11/2025, 10:41:02):** This component, responsible for mobile UI previews, was updated with conditional rendering for different checkout steps (brand, login, payments, address, coupons). It fetches and displays UI configurations like logos, banner content, and coupon information. The trust banner data loading logic handles both custom and default lists.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx` (29/10/2025, 21:03:41):** New form inputs (`loyaltyInputs`) were added to configure loyalty features, including allowing Cash on Delivery with loyalty, stacking with manual discount codes, auto-applying credits, custom display names for reward points, showing earned loyalty points, and specifying calculation rules (e.g., percentage of order value).
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (30/10/2025, 07:53:01 - 31/10/2025, 23:03:18):** This configuration file primarily shows changes in the base URLs for various `@gokwik` microfrontends (`@gokwik/utilities`, `@gokwik/checkout`, `@gokwik/payment`, etc.) across different deployment environments (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`).

## 16:43:18
The provided log details changes across two primary files: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`, with multiple entries for each, all occurring between late October and early November 2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   Between October 28th and October 29th, 2025, the Dockerfile for the `mint-dashboard` application saw a minor but notable adjustment in its dependency installation step. Initially, `npm install -f` was used, which was later changed to `npm install` on October 29, 2025, at 23:35:21. The core structure of using a Node.js 20 Alpine image, setting a working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package.json`, running Prisma generate, building, and exposing port 3000 remained consistent across these changes.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**:
    *   On November 3, 2025, this file underwent several iterations focused on implementing and refining email reporting functionality.
    *   At 17:38:44, the initial implementation was logged. This introduced server-side email sending using `nodemailer` for daily and weekly reports. It included functions to save PNG report data (`pngReportData`), retrieve reports (`getPngReportByTodayDate`), delete data (`deletepngReportData`), and send emails (`sendEmailForReport`). Cron job scheduling for daily and weekly reports was present but commented out, indicating potential future activation. The email sender was set to "integration-noreply@gokwik.co".
    *   A minor update at 17:39:41 changed the `from` email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in".
    *   Another change at 18:12:32 added a `console.log(res)` statement within the `sendEmailForReport` function, specifically after the `transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)` call, likely for debugging the email sending process.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The project path `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/` is consistent across all log entries.
*   The timestamps indicate focused development periods, with Dockerfile changes in late October and a concentrated effort on the email sending route file on November 3rd.
*   Multiple, closely timed entries for the same file suggest an iterative development process, where small changes or tests are committed in quick succession.
*   The code base is a Node.js/Next.js application, utilizing Prisma for database interactions and `node-cron` (though commented out) for scheduling.
*   The email functionality is designed to send daily and weekly reports containing images (base64 encoded) to a `PARENT_EMAIL` address, indicating a reporting or notification system.

## 16:44:25
`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`
This file, focusing on product-based shipping rules, underwent continuous development between 29/10/2025 and 01/11/2025.
Key changes include:
*   **29/10/2025, 17:30:43:** Initial setup of the component to manage product-based shipping rules, using UI kit components for forms, tables, and drawers, along with custom hooks for merchant configuration.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:09:53:** A significant functional change was introduced where new product-based rules for a shipping ID are now *appended* to an existing list (`targetedShipping.product_based_rules = [...(targetedShipping?.product_based_rules || []),formValues]`) instead of overwriting it, allowing multiple rules per shipping method.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:10:24:** Minor safety improvement by adding a check for `formValues?.shipping_id` before attempting to delete the `shipping_id` property.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:40:49 to 01/11/2025, 12:04:22:** Several iterations refined the deletion logic for existing product-based rules during an edit operation. This included conditional deletion based on the number of rules and an attempt to filter and delete specific rules, with `.trim()` added for robust name comparison in the filter. This indicates an ongoing effort to correctly manage complex rule deletion scenarios.
*   Throughout this period, there were also several instances of adding or removing `console.log` statements and commenting/uncommenting `saveConfig` calls, indicating active debugging.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`
This Redux slice defines UI customization options.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:05:03:** A new field `is_consent_auto_select: true` was added to `login_data` in the `initialState`, introducing a new option for pre-selecting a consent checkbox.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:27:17:** The field `is_consent_required` in `login_data` was renamed to `isConsentVisible`, updating the semantic meaning of the property controlling consent section visibility.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`
This component for customizing the login step UI saw substantial changes between 29/10/2025, 18:09:05 and 29/10/2025, 18:58:39.
Key updates include:
*   **Initial Setup (29/10/2025, 18:09:05):** Basic structure for banner, CTA text, and consent section customization.
*   **Refactoring with `fields` array (29/10/2025, 18:17:05 to 18:26:23):** Major refactoring standardized the rendering of UI elements (Banner, Primary Button, Consent Section) by defining them within a `fields` array and using a generic `RenderField` component. This makes the form more data-driven and flexible.
*   **Renaming and new component (29/10/2025, 18:27:00 & 18:39:37):** `is_consent_required` was consistently renamed to `isConsentVisible` to align with the Redux store. The `RenderEditorFunction` for the "Consent Section" was replaced by `BannerComponentRendrer`, suggesting a specialized component for managing this content.
*   **New Feature: Auto-select consent (29/10/2025, 18:44:05):** A new switch for `is_consent_auto_select` was added to the "Consent Section", allowing merchants to configure automatic pre-selection of the offers and updates consent box.
*   **New Validation (29/10/2025, 18:58:39):** Validation was added to `handleFormSubmit` to ensure that if the "Continue" button is visible, its text cannot be left empty.
*   Minor stylistic adjustments (e.g., `font-light`, `font-normal`, `mt-2`) were also made for UI refinement.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`
This component provides a preview of the mobile checkout UI and was subject to several minor changes from 29/10/2025 to 04/11/2025. All recorded changes during this period were minor formatting or whitespace adjustments, indicating no functional modifications were introduced based on this log. The component continues to dynamically render different sections of the checkout (brand, login, payments, etc.) based on props and Redux state.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`
This file, responsible for rendering various form elements related to integrations, saw significant updates to loyalty program configuration.
*   **29/10/2025, 21:03:41:** Extensive `loyaltyInputs` were defined, including switches for `enable_cod_with_loyalty`, `enable_discount_with_credits`, `enable_auto_apply_credits`, and `enable_earned_loyalty_points`. Inputs for `loyalty_display_name` and `enable_earned_loyalty_points.rules` (percentage-based) were added, along with a `loyalty_sales_channel` checkbox. Each field was accompanied by tooltips and validation rules, detailing new configuration options for loyalty programs.

The `mint-dashboard` project repository shows changes across two distinct file types: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   Multiple entries on 28/10/2025 (12:27:10, 12:27:41, 12:29:42) indicate an unchanging Dockerfile definition, which uses `node:20-alpine` as a base, sets `/app` as the working directory, installs `openssl`, copies package definitions, installs dependencies with `npm install -f`, copies the application, generates Prisma schema, builds the application, exposes port `3000`, and starts the application with `npm start`.
    *   A significant update occurred on **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**, where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`, removing the force flag.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**:
    *   Initial significant content was logged on **03/11/2025, 17:38:44**. This file sets up an API endpoint (`POST`) to save image data for daily/weekly reports, using `date-fns` for date formatting and interacting with backend queries (`pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, `deletepngReportData`). It includes functions (`sendDailyReport`, `sendWeeklyReport`) to retrieve reports and send emails using `nodemailer`, with email configuration sourced from environment variables. The `from` email address was initially set to "integration-noreply@gokwik.co". A `GET` endpoint triggers `sendDailyReport`. Commented-out `node-cron` schedules indicate an intention or past use of scheduled report generation.
    *   On **03/11/2025, 17:39:41**, a minor change was made in the `sendEmailForReport` function: the `from` email address was updated from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in".
    *   On **03/11/2025, 18:12:32**, a `console.log(res)` statement was added within the `sendEmailForReport` function after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` to log the response from the email sending operation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dockerfile**: Demonstrates a standard pattern for building Node.js applications within a Docker container, including dependency management, Prisma schema generation, and application build steps. The consistency across initial logs highlights a stable setup.
*   **`app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**: Shows a clear pattern for handling email-based reports. It consistently uses `nodemailer` for email sending, relies on environment variables for sensitive email credentials and settings, processes image data for reports, and includes commented-out `node-cron` sections, suggesting a recurring design for background tasks. Error handling with `try-catch` blocks is also consistently applied. The use of `NextRequest` and `NextResponse` indicates a Next.js API route implementation.

## 18:43:54
The recent changes focus primarily on enhancing and refining UI customization, shipping configurations, and discount management within a checkout dashboard application. Several iterations involve debugging, refactoring, and introducing new features.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Implementation & Refinement (29/10/2025, 17:30:43 - 30/10/2025, 11:01:12)**: This component, responsible for product-based shipping rules, was introduced and underwent initial setup. It uses `Form`, `Card`, `Drawer`, and `Table` from `gokwik-ui-kit` to manage rules. Initial logic included filtering existing shipping configurations and performing basic form submissions, with temporary `console.log` statements for debugging.
    *   **Rule Management Evolution (31/10/2025, 23:09:53 - 01/11/2025, 12:04:22)**: A significant change at **31/10/2025, 23:09:53** altered how `product_based_rules` are handled: instead of completely replacing the array, new rules are now appended (`...existingRules, newRule`). Subsequent changes refined the deletion logic for existing rules, moving from a simple `delete` of the entire `product_based_rules` property to more nuanced attempts at removing specific rules within the array, although some intermediate steps showed incorrect deletion syntax. The `disabled` state for `selectedOptions` in the "Map to a shipping ID" dropdown was commented out at **31/10/2025, 23:05:43**, potentially allowing more flexible rule mapping.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   **Login Data Schema Updates (29/10/2025, 18:04:43 - 29/10/2025, 18:27:17)**: The Redux slice's `initialState` for `login_data` was updated. Initially, a typo `is_ isContinueButtonVisible` was corrected. Later, `is_consent_auto_select: true` was added, and `is_consent_required` was renamed to `isConsentVisible`, indicating a change in the data model for login UI elements.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
    *   **UI Elements & Form Integration (29/10/2025, 18:09:05 - 29/10/2025, 18:23:38)**: This page, responsible for login UI customization, underwent significant restructuring. Key UI sections like "Primary Button" and "Consent Section" were refactored into a `fields` array to be rendered dynamically by `RenderField`. This involved shifting from direct JSX rendering to a more modular, data-driven approach, resolving initial rendering issues for the primary button input. Minor stylistic changes to font weights and classes were also observed.
    *   **Consent Section Enhancements (29/10/2025, 18:39:37 - 29/10/2025, 18:58:39)**: The "Consent Section" was further enhanced by importing and integrating `BannerComponentRendrer` for more flexible text editing. A new `Switch` for `is_consent_auto_select` was added, allowing configuration to pre-select the consent checkbox. Finally, a validation rule was introduced to prevent empty CTA text if the "Continue" button is visible.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **Preview Component Stability (29/10/2025, 18:48:04 - 04/11/2025, 10:41:02)**: This component, providing a mobile preview of the checkout UI, saw its initial implementation. It dynamically renders different checkout steps (brand, login, payments, etc.) based on an `activeTab` state and utilizes Redux data for UI elements like logos, banners, and coupon displays. Throughout the observed period, this file remained largely stable after its initial commit, primarily experiencing minor saves without functional code changes.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**
    *   **Loyalty Program Configuration (29/10/2025, 21:03:41)**: A new `loyaltyInputs` array was introduced, adding extensive form fields for configuring loyalty points. This includes switches for "Allow Cash on Delivery" and "Allow Stacking with Manual Discount Codes", inputs for custom display names, rules for earned loyalty points (percentage, calculation basis), and sales channel controls.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **New Shipping Tab (30/10/2025, 10:46:02 - 30/10/2025, 10:49:18)**: A "Product Based Shipping" tab was added to the shipping settings interface. This new tab integrates the `ProductBasedShipping` component. Conditional rendering for this tab was subsequently implemented, making its visibility dependent on `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
    *   **Product-Based Shipping Logic (30/10/2025, 10:02:10 - 01/11/2025, 12:13:37)**: This file defines the core logic for managing product-based shipping rules. It handles state for selected items, mapping product/collection data, and generating form fields. It also includes `ProductSearch` components for adding specific products or collections and logic to prevent duplicate selections. After its initial detailed implementation, the file saw no significant functional changes, only minor saves or commented-out sections for debugging.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   **Shipping Method Configuration (30/10/2025, 10:53:28 - 30/10/2025, 11:00:27)**: This component handles configuration for shipping methods, including advanced conditions via modals, customer segmentation, and CSV upload/download functionalities for pincode and cohort data. It defines fields for shipping name, price, and min/max order values with validation. No significant functional changes were recorded after its initial detailed implementation.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **Bulk Discount Generation (30/10/2025, 17:52:43 - 30/10/2025, 18:26:49)**: This component supports creating bulk discounts through random code generation or CSV upload. It validates discount codes and the feasibility of random code generation. The S3 upload functionality for CSV files (`makeAWSPutCall`) was repeatedly commented out and uncommented between **30/10/2025, 17:52:43** and **30/10/2025, 18:26:49**, indicating active development and testing of this feature. A validation for empty prefix/suffix was also added.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   **Discount API Mapping (30/10/2025, 18:29:20)**: This file centralizes API data mapping logic for discounts. It defines utility functions for customer eligibility, matching types, and extensive transformations for products and collections. A key function, `requestMapDiscount.setup`, was introduced to convert complex UI form data into the specific payload format required by the backend API for various discount types, including handling product/variant additions and removals for "Buy X Get Y" discounts.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`**
    *   **Free Gift Rule Management (03/11/2025, 11:41:24)**: This component was introduced to manage automatic free gift rules. It provides a form with various fields for defining rule name, sales channels, purchase requirements (cart value/quantity), product applicability (all/specific products/collections), selecting a free gift product, quantity, price, and application method (auto/customer selection with limit). It includes a table to display existing rules with edit and delete actions, and functions to manage selected products and collections.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/tieredDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **Tiered Discount Configuration (03/11/2025, 16:16:44)**: This component provides an interface for configuring tiered discounts. It initializes with existing discounts, filters out COD payment methods, and allows adding, editing, and deleting tiered discounts. The `tieredDiscountAddition` function includes validation and handles "Freebie" vs "Non Freebie" discount types. The table supports inline editing for various discount parameters.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
    *   **Expanded Discount Validations (03/11/2025, 16:19:20)**: This utility file received an update to its `validateTieredDiscount` function. A new validation rule, `differentFreebieForSameRange`, was added to prevent assigning distinct freebie products to tiered discounts that share overlapping ranges. This enhances the integrity of tiered discount configurations.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **Product/Collection Detail Fetching (04/11/2025, 12:02:47 - 04/11/2025, 12:03:31)**: The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was added/updated to fetch detailed information for product variants or collections based on provided IDs. It includes logic to map product variants to their parent products.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **New API Endpoints (04/11/2025, 12:03:46)**: New API endpoints, `getVariantById` and `getCollectionById`, were introduced to support the `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` utility function, reflecting expanded data retrieval capabilities.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI-driven Configuration**: A consistent pattern across files is the extensive use of forms and dynamic UI components (`gokwik-ui-kit`, `RenderField`, `ProductSearch`) to configure various features (shipping rules, loyalty, free gifts, tiered discounts).
*   **State Management and React Hooks**: `useState` and `useEffect` are heavily used for managing local component state, often synchronized with global Redux state via `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch`.
*   **API Interactions and Data Transformation**: Components frequently interact with backend APIs (`makeAPICall`, `useMerchantConfigApi`) and include complex logic to map UI form data to API payloads and vice-versa.
*   **Validation**: Dedicated validation functions are common for ensuring data integrity before submitting configurations, especially for rules-based features like discounts and shipping.
*   **Feature Expansion**: The log shows a clear trend of adding new, configurable features such as product-based shipping rules, enhanced loyalty program settings, and comprehensive free gift management.
*   **Debugging and Iteration**: Multiple instances of `console.log` statements and commented-out code blocks suggest an active development and debugging process, particularly for new or complex functionalities.

## 20:50:18
The logs show changes across two main files: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`. No summary will be generated for `.env` files.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   On 28/10/2025, multiple entries show the Dockerfile for a Node.js 20 Alpine application. It sets up a working directory, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` for caching, runs `npm install -f`, copies the rest of the application, generates the Prisma schema, builds the application, exposes port 3000, and starts with `npm start`.
    *   A significant change occurred on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was altered from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`, removing the `force` flag.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**:
    *   The initial version on 03/11/2025 at 17:38:44 introduced a server-side Next.js API route (`/api/sendemail`) for handling email reports.
        *   The `POST` endpoint saves image data (`imageData`), header (`headerName`), and `reportId` for daily/weekly reports to a backend database, formatted with `date-fns`.
        *   Functions `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` are responsible for fetching report data, formatting it, and then invoking `sendEmailForReport`. `sendDailyReport` also includes a `deletepngReportData` call after sending.
        *   The `sendEmailForReport` function uses `nodemailer` to create and send emails. It configures the transporter using environment variables (`EMAIL_HOST`, `PORT_NO`, `SMTP_EMAIL`, `SMTP_PASS`), sets the sender to `integration-noreply@gokwik.co`, the recipient to `PARENT_EMAIL`, and embeds a base64-encoded PNG image as an attachment.
        *   A `GET` endpoint is present to trigger `sendDailyReport` and return a status.
        *   Notably, cron job scheduling logic for daily and weekly reports is commented out in this initial version.
    *   A quick update at 03/11/2025, 17:39:41, modified the sender email address in `mailOptions.from` from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
    *   Another change at 03/11/2025, 18:12:32, added a `console.log(res)` statement after sending the email within the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely for debugging or logging the email sending response.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**: Dockerfile `npm install` command modification.
*   **03/11/2025, 17:38:44**: Initial implementation of the email sending API.
*   **03/11/2025, 17:39:41**: Change in sender email domain in `sendemail/route.ts`.
*   **03/11/2025, 18:12:32**: Addition of a `console.log` for email sending response in `sendemail/route.ts`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development:** The rapid succession of changes to `app/api/sendemail/route.ts` on 03/11/2025 (within minutes or seconds) indicates active development, testing, and debugging related to the email sending functionality.
*   **Email Report Focus:** The `sendemail/route.ts` file is entirely dedicated to the processing, saving, and sending of daily and weekly reports with embedded images, leveraging external libraries like `nodemailer` and `date-fns`, and interacting with backend services for data management.
*   **Docker Standard Practices:** The Dockerfile follows standard practices for Node.js applications, including multi-stage considerations (copying `package*.json` separately for caching) and Prisma schema generation.
*   **Commented Cron Jobs:** The presence of commented-out `node-cron` schedules in `sendemail/route.ts` suggests that automated report scheduling is a planned feature or was considered but not yet activated.
*   **Environment Variable Reliance:** The email functionality heavily relies on environment variables for sensitive configuration like host, port, and authentication credentials, indicating good security practice.

## 20:50:58
**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx**
    *   **29/10/2025, 17:30:43 - 17:32:12**: Minor formatting changes with no functional impact.
    *   **30/10/2025, 10:35:02 - 11:01:12**: Temporary `console.log` statements were added and then removed within the `useEffect` hook, likely for debugging purposes, to inspect `shippingPrices` and `config?.shipping_prices`.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:09:53**: The `handleFormSubmit` function was updated to append new product-based rules (`formValues`) to an existing `targetedShipping.product_based_rules` array, rather than overwriting it entirely.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:10:24**: A condition (`formValues?.shipping_id &&`) was added before deleting `shipping_id` from `formValues`, ensuring it's only deleted if present.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:19:31 - 23:26:00**: The core `saveConfig` call and related state updates (setting `itemsData`, `setModalOpen`, `form.resetFields`) were temporarily commented out within `handleFormSubmit`. Debugging code, including `console.log(shippingPrices)` and `return`, was introduced, indicating a focus on the logic before persisting changes.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:40:49 - 01/11/2025, 12:04:22**: Significant changes were made to the logic for deleting product-based shipping rules when a rule is being updated (within the `if (open && previousShippingId)` block). This involved attempting to remove a rule from the `product_based_rules` array:
        *   Initially, it checked if `product_based_rules` had a length of 1 to delete the entire property.
        *   Later, it attempted to filter for a matching rule by name and then use `delete` on the resulting single-element array, which was refined to use `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]` (potentially problematic for array manipulation).
        *   Finally, the comparison for matching rules was improved by adding `.trim()` to handle potential whitespace issues. The `saveConfig` and related state updates were uncommented, reactivating the save functionality.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts**
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:05:03**: A new property, `is_consent_auto_select: true`, was added to the `login_data` object in the `initialState` definition, introducing a feature to auto-select consent on the login page.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx**
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:17:05 - 18:23:18**: The "Primary Button" section's rendering was refactored. It was initially hardcoded, then integrated into a `fields` array as a `switch` type, then moved back to a `custom` render type within the `fields` array. This reflects an iterative approach to UI component management.
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:23:38 - 18:26:23**: The "Consent Section" was also refactored from direct JSX rendering into a `custom` field within the `fields` array, consolidating form field definitions.
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:27:00**: The state key for controlling consent visibility was changed from `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible` in both the `initialValues` and the `RenderEditorFunction` call. Corresponding validation logic in `handleFormSubmit` was updated.
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:39:37**: The "Consent Section Text" rendering was refactored to use `BannerComponentRendrer` instead of `RenderEditorFunction`, indicating a component change for this specific UI element.
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:44:05**: Functionality for "Auto-select offers and updates consent box on checkout" was introduced, including a new `Switch` and descriptive text within the "Consent Section" custom field.
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:46:01**: The `is_consent_auto_select` property in `initialValues` was explicitly set to `true`.
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:58:39**: Added a new validation rule in `handleFormSubmit` to check if `primary_button_text` is empty when `isContinueButtonVisible` is enabled, providing an error message if so.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx**
    *   **29/10/2025, 18:48:04 - 04/11/2025, 10:41:02**: No significant functional changes were observed across these timestamps. The numerous commits appear to be minor reformatting, whitespace adjustments, or negligible character changes within the JSX structure of the `MobileStepUI` component.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx**
    *   **29/10/2025, 21:03:41**: This file defines various form fields for integration settings, including detailed configurations for loyalty programs such as allowing COD with loyalty, stacking with manual discounts, auto-application, custom display names, showing earned loyalty points, and sales channel control. Tooltips are extensively used for explanation.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx**
    *   **30/10/2025, 10:49:18**: The "Product Based Shipping" tab in the `Tabs` component was made conditional. It now only renders if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is truthy, indicating feature flagging for this section.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx**
    *   **30/10/2025, 10:53:28 - 11:00:27**: No significant functional changes were identified. The multiple timestamps suggest minor reformatting or non-substantive edits.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx**
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:19:56**: The file upload logic in `uploadDiscountCSV` was reverted to use `makeAWSPutCall` with `includeUserIdHeader: false`, after a previous change had it commented out and replaced with a direct `fetch` call using `includeUserIdHeader: true`.
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:25:19**: The actual S3 file upload logic (the `if (preSignedURL) { ... }` block) within `uploadDiscountCSV` was commented out entirely, and `callBack()` was called immediately, effectively disabling the upload. A `console.log("upload")` was temporarily added.
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:26:49**: The S3 file upload logic within `uploadDiscountCSV` was uncommented, re-enabling the functionality.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts**
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:29:20**: This file contains utility functions for mapping and validating discount-related data, such as `customerEligibility`, `assignMatchType`, `mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`, and `requestMapDiscount` for setting up various discount types (basic, BXGY, free shipping).

    *   **03/11/2025, 16:16:44**: This component handles tiered discount configurations. It includes state management for adding, editing, and deleting tiered discounts, with fields for payment method, discount code, order limits, discount value, freebies, RTO action dependency, and capping amount. It dynamically filters payment methods to exclude COD. A `tieredDiscountAddition` function validates and adds/updates discounts.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts**
    *   **03/11/2025, 16:19:20**: A new validation rule, `differentFreebieForSameRange`, was added to the `validateTieredDiscount` function. This rule prevents selecting different freebie products for tiered discounts that share common order value ranges, ensuring consistency.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts**
    *   **04/11/2025, 12:02:47 - 12:03:31**: No significant functional changes were identified across these timestamps.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts**

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Minor Updates**: Many files show rapid, consecutive changes within a few seconds or minutes (e.g., `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `loginPage.tsx`, `mobilePage.tsx`, `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`). This often indicates active development, small adjustments, or automated formatting saves.
*   **Debugging Activities**: Use of `console.log` statements and commenting out/uncommenting blocks of code (especially `saveConfig` calls) suggests active debugging and testing during development (e.g., `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`).
*   **UI Component Refactoring**: There's a pattern of moving UI elements from direct JSX into more structured `fields` arrays and utilizing `RenderField` or specific component renderers (`RenderEditorFunction`, `BannerComponentRendrer`). This is evident in `loginPage.tsx`, indicating an effort towards more modular and data-driven form rendering.
*   **Feature Flagging**: New features, like the "Product Based Shipping" tab in `shippingBasedService.tsx` or `is_consent_auto_select` in `customize-ui/index.ts`, are introduced with conditional rendering or default values, hinting at a controlled rollout or A/B testing approach.
*   **Discount and Shipping Configuration**: A significant portion of changes revolves around managing shipping rules (product-based, tiered) and discount creation, including validation logic and API interactions for these features.
*   **API Interaction Logic**: Components frequently interact with `useMerchantConfigApi` for fetching and saving configuration, and `makeAPICall` for other data operations, often involving presigned URLs for file uploads.
*   **State Management**: Extensive use of `useState` and `Form.useWatch` (from `gokwik-ui-kit`) is common for managing local component state and form values, alongside Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) for global state.

## 21:50:12
The repository shows changes across two primary files: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`. Log entries for `.env` files, which may contain sensitive keys, have been excluded from this summary.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 28/10/2025, 12:27:10 to 28/10/2025, 12:29:42**: The Dockerfile remained consistent, setting up a Node.js 20 Alpine environment. It includes steps to install `openssl`, copy `package.json` for caching, install dependencies, copy application code, generate Prisma schema, build the application, expose port 3000, and start the application.
    *   **Timestamp: 29/10/2025, 23:35:21**: A minor change was introduced in the dependency installation step. The command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp: 03/11/2025, 17:38:44**: This file defines API routes (`POST` and `GET`) for handling email reports.
        *   The `POST` endpoint saves daily or weekly report image data, header, and date using a `pngReportData` function.
        *   Functions `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` are defined to fetch report data, format dates, and send emails. `sendDailyReport` also includes a call to `deletepngReportData` after sending.
        *   The `sendEmailForReport` function uses `nodemailer` to send emails, embedding a base64 encoded PNG image in an HTML body. SMTP configuration (host, port, user, pass) is loaded from environment variables.
        *   A `GET` endpoint triggers the `sendDailyReport` function and returns a status.
        *   Commented-out `node-cron` schedules for daily and weekly reports (running at 1 AM UTC, timezone Asia/Kolkata) are present, indicating potential future automation.
    *   **Timestamp: 03/11/2025, 17:39:41**: The email sender's address in `sendEmailForReport` was updated from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in".
    *   **Timestamp: 03/11/2025, 18:12:32**: A `console.log(res)` statement was added immediately after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)` within the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely for debugging the email sending process.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Environment Variables**: The application consistently relies on `process.env` for configuration, particularly for email sending credentials (`EMAIL_HOST`, `PORT_NO`, `SMTP_EMAIL`, `SMTP_PASS`, `PARENT_EMAIL`).
*   **Prisma Integration**: The Dockerfile includes `npx prisma generate`, indicating the use of Prisma ORM for database interactions.
*   **Report Generation and Delivery**: There's a clear pattern of generating reports as images (`imageData`), storing them (via `pngReportData`), and delivering them via email, with specific logic for daily and weekly reports.
*   **Date Formatting**: The `date-fns` library is used for consistent date formatting across the email reporting logic.
*   **Cron Job Setup**: Although commented out, the presence of `node-cron` schedules suggests an intention for automated, timed report distribution.
*   **API Structure**: The `sendemail/route.ts` file utilizes Next.js's API route structure, with `POST` for saving data and `GET` for triggering actions.

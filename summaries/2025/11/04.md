# Activity Summary for 04/11/2025

## 09:43:17
The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` saw several updates between October 28th and 29th, 2025. The initial versions (28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 12:27:41; 12:29:42) were identical, establishing a Docker build process for a Node.js 20 Alpine application. This process includes setting a working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json` and installing dependencies with `npm install -f`, copying the entire source, generating Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting with `npm start`. A significant change occurred on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file received updates on November 3rd, 2025.
The first recorded change on 03/11/2025 at 17:38:44 introduced a robust email reporting system:
*   A `POST` endpoint was added to receive image data, header name, and report ID, saving this information to a backend via `pngReportData`.
*   Functions `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` were implemented to fetch report data, format dates, filter for daily/weekly reports, and then trigger email sending. `sendDailyReport` also includes a call to `deletepngReportData` after a successful email.
*   The `sendEmailForReport` asynchronous function was created to handle the actual email dispatch using `nodemailer`, configuring a transporter with environment variables for host, port, and authentication. It generates an HTML email with an embedded PNG image.
*   A `GET` endpoint was added to manually trigger `sendDailyReport` and return a status message.
*   Cron job schedules for daily and weekly reports were present but commented out, indicating planned future automation.

A subsequent minor update on 03/11/2025 at 17:39:41 changed the `from` email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in".
Finally, on 03/11/2025 at 18:12:32, a `console.log(res)` statement was added after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` in the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely for debugging the email sending process.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Project Structure:** The file paths indicate a Next.js project (`app/api` directory) with a backend API route.
*   **Dependency Management:** The Dockerfile consistently uses Node.js 20 Alpine and npm for dependency management, with a slight adjustment in the `npm install` command.
*   **Prisma ORM:** The Dockerfile includes `npx prisma generate`, indicating the use of Prisma for database interactions.
*   **Email Functionality:** The `sendemail/route.ts` file shows a strong focus on email-based reporting, utilizing `nodemailer`, `date-fns`, and custom backend queries for report data.
*   **Environment Variable Reliance:** The email sending functionality heavily relies on environment variables (e.g., `EMAIL_HOST`, `PORT_NO`, `SMTP_EMAIL`, `SMTP_PASS`, `PARENT_EMAIL`), implying external configuration for email services.
*   **Cron Job Intent:** While commented out, the presence of `node-cron` schedules suggests an intention to automate daily and weekly report emails.

The `mint-dashboard` project underwent a series of focused updates between late October and early November 2025, primarily affecting its Docker build process and email reporting functionality.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   Between 28/10/2025 and 29/10/2025, this file saw minor iterations. The core build steps remained consistent, utilizing `node:20-alpine` as a base, setting `/app` as the working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json` for dependency installation, copying the entire source code, generating Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting the application with `npm start`.
    *   A notable change occurred around 29/10/2025, 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`, removing the force flag.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**:
    *   This file, responsible for handling email reports, saw two key changes on 03/11/2025.
    *   At 17:39:41, the sender email domain was updated within the `sendEmailForReport` function, changing `from: "integration-noreply@gokwik.co"` to `from: "integration-noreply@gokwik.in"`.
    *   Later, at 18:12:32, logging was added to the email sending process: `let res = await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions); console.log(res)` was introduced, indicating an attempt to debug or monitor the email delivery status.
    *   The file uses `nodemailer` for sending emails, `date-fns` for date formatting, `node-cron` (though commented out for daily/weekly report scheduling), and interacts with backend queries for `pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, and `deletepngReportData`. It supports saving and sending daily and weekly image reports.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Application Focus**: The changes indicate an application focused on reporting, specifically generating and emailing daily/weekly reports containing images. It utilizes Prisma for database interaction and Node.js/Next.js for the application logic.
*   **Email Configuration**: There's a strong emphasis on email functionality, with the `sendemail/route.ts` file being refined for sender details and delivery logging.
*   **Build Process Consistency**: The Dockerfile remains largely stable, suggesting a well-defined build process for the application, with only minor tweaks to dependency handling.
*   **Timeframe**: All recorded changes fall within a short, concentrated period, primarily late October and early November 2025, suggesting active development or debugging cycles during this time.

# Activity Summary for 10/11/2025

## 12:04:26
The primary focus of these code changes is the `index.ejs` file, which serves as the entry point for a "Gokwik Dashboard" application, demonstrating an evolving Content Security Policy (CSP) and configuration for a micro-frontend architecture across different deployment environments.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Downloads/index.ejs` (10/11/2025, 11:38:23)**: This initial entry shows the basic structure of the EJS template. It includes:
    *   Standard HTML5 boilerplate with a title "Gokwik Dashboard".
    *   A Content Security Policy (CSP) meta tag with relatively broad `default-src`, `script-src`, `connect-src`, `style-src`, `img-src` directives allowing `self`, `https:`, `localhost:*`, and `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` for scripts.
    *   `regenerator-runtime` for async/await support.
    *   `fcWidgetMessengerConfig` for Freshchat integration.
    *   A `systemjs-importmap` to define shared dependencies (React, React-DOM, single-spa) from CDN.
    *   Conditional `systemjs-importmap` blocks based on `isLocal` or `deployedEnv` (dev, qa, sandbox, production) to load various `@gokwik/*` micro-frontend bundles from environment-specific URLs (e.g., `localhost:`, `dev-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`, `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`, `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`).
    *   New Relic and Clarity analytics scripts are included specifically within the `production` environment block.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (10/11/2025, 11:38:32)**: This timestamp indicates a copy or move operation, as the content of the file at this new path is identical to the previous `index.ejs` log entry.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (10/11/2025, 11:38:40)**: This marks a significant security-related update:
    *   A `<meta name="referrer" content="strict-origin-when-cross-origin">` tag was added.
    *   The Content Security Policy (CSP) was completely refactored from a single, generic policy to highly granular, environment-specific policies.
    *   A cryptographic `nonce` (generated using `crypto.randomBytes`) was introduced and used in the `script-src` directives of the new CSPs, as well as applied to the `fcWidgetMessengerConfig` and the main `systemjs-importmap` script tags for enhanced security.
    *   The `script-src` directive removed `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` in favor of `nonce` attributes and specific `sha256` hashes for allowed inline scripts.
    *   Extensive whitelisting of domains was performed across `connect-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, `media-src`, `frame-src`, and `font-src` directives for each environment, including new "os" (order service, inventory, item) domains for dev, qa, sandbox, and production.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (10/11/2025, 11:39:12)**: This entry represents a full **reversion** of the security changes introduced at 11:38:40.
    *   The `<meta name="referrer" ...>` tag was removed.
    *   The complex, conditional CSP blocks with nonces and SHA256 hashes were replaced by the original, more permissive CSP that allows `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`.
    *   The `nonce` attributes were removed from the relevant script tags.
    *   The extensive domain whitelisting across various CSP directives was also removed, bringing the file back to a state almost identical to the 11:38:32 version.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Centrality of `index.ejs`:** All key code changes, including the file move, security updates, and their subsequent reversion, revolve around this single EJS template file.
*   **Micro-frontend architecture:** The consistent use of `systemjs-importmap` to dynamically load `@gokwik/*` modules (configuration, dashboard, checkout, payment, etc.) highlights a clear micro-frontend pattern for the "Gokwik Dashboard."
*   **Environment-specific configurations:** The EJS template relies heavily on conditional logic (`<% if (isLocal) { %>`, `<% else if (deployedEnv==='dev') { %>`) to configure module loading paths and, briefly, CSPs, adapting the application behavior to different deployment environments.
*   **External Integrations:** The consistent presence of Freshchat, New Relic, and Clarity analytics scripts (especially in the `production` block) indicates a standard set of third-party tools integrated into the dashboard.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) management:** The logs show a significant, albeit temporary, attempt to enhance the application's security posture by implementing a strict, nonce-based, and environment-specific CSP. The subsequent reversion suggests potential challenges in its implementation or compatibility issues that led to rolling back the changes.

The logs show changes across two files, primarily related to environment configuration and a merchant testing page.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts:**
    This TypeScript file is central to managing environment-specific configurations for various Gokwik services. It defines functions to determine base URLs for health services, address suggestions, core APIs, CRED payments, experiments, Twidpay, KP API, CDN paths, and analytics (both v1 and v2) based on the current `env` variable. It also defines `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` values, which are environment-dependent session tokens. The `env` and `merchantUrl` variables are set via subscriptions to Svelte stores (`CommonStore` and `LoginStore`).
    Across the three provided timestamps (10/11/2025, 14:45:18; 10/11/2025, 14:45:24; and 10/11/2025, 15:16:02), the content of this file appears to be identical, indicating no substantive code changes within these specific log entries, but rather re-saves or re-logging of the same state.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html:**
    This HTML file serves as a test page for a merchant integration. It includes a custom JavaScript SDK (`gokwikSdk`) which handles initialization, payment processing, event emission, and button visibility. The SDK dynamically injects the `gokwik.js` script (from `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js`) when `init()` is called. The page also contains a "click me" button to trigger `goKwikCheckout()` and includes embedded `merchantInfo` with an `environment: 'local'`, `storeId`, and `fbpixel` for testing purposes. It also sets `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` cookies. The page has placeholder divs for `gokwik-div` and `privy-widget` suggesting integration with other UI components. This file was last modified at 10/11/2025, 14:45:43.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **10/11/2025, 14:45:18, 14:45:24, and 15:16:02:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file was recorded at these timestamps. As noted, the content remained unchanged across these entries.
*   **10/11/2025, 14:45:43:** The `merchant.html` file was recorded, showing the setup of a test page for the Gokwik SDK.

**Patterns or recurring elements in the content:**

*   **Environment-based configuration:** A strong pattern is the extensive use of an `env` variable to conditionally determine API endpoints and other service URLs. This includes various development environments (`dev`, `hdev`, `ndev`, `idev`, `local`), QA environments (`qa`, `qaone`, `qatwo`, `qa-rto`), sandbox, and production (`production`, `pci-prod`).
*   **Consistent URL structures:** Many URLs follow a `https://api-gw-v4.dev.gokwik.io/` or `https://[env]-core-api.dev.gokwik.in` pattern for non-production environments, while production often uses `https://api-gw.gokwik.io` or `https://gkx.gokwik.co`.
*   **Svelte store integration:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file uses `store_merchanturl`, `store_environment`, and `store_cashToPrepaid` from Svelte stores to dynamically update configuration variables.
*   **Gokwik SDK and merchant testing:** The `merchant.html` demonstrates a common pattern for integrating and testing the Gokwik SDK, including dynamically loading scripts, setting `merchantInfo` through `window.postMessage`, and managing cookies for analytics.
*   **Session Token Management:** `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` functions show a pattern of assigning different static session tokens based on the current environment, primarily differentiating between sandbox/dev, production, and QA.

## 15:51:02
The file `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` was modified on `10/11/2025, 15:15:21`.

This React TypeScript component, `ProductSearch`, provides a highly configurable interface for searching and selecting either products or collections. It integrates with a `gokwik-ui-kit` for its UI elements and utility hooks.

**Key Functionality and Updates:**

*   **Search and Selection:** The component allows users to search for Shopify products or collections using a debounced input field. It supports adding selected items, managing their quantities, and removing them.
*   **Configurability:** It is highly customizable through props, allowing control over its appearance (e.g., `hideSearch`, `hideButton`, `buttonText`, `hideSearchInput`), behavior (`searchType`, `collateProducts`, `showQuantity`, `isAgentLed`), and data handling (`items`, `onAdd`, `onRemove`).
*   **Data Fetching and Management:**
    *   It uses `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` to fetch data from an API.
    *   Includes logic to filter out items tagged 'no-agent' if `isAgentLed` is true.
    *   The `parseResponse` function handles structuring the fetched data, especially for products with multiple variants, by collating them.
    *   Manages internal state for loading, search results, pagination, and selected items with their quantities.
*   **User Interface and Interaction:**
    *   Renders a button or a read-only input to trigger a modal for search.
    *   Within the modal, it displays search results and allows users to select items.
    *   Supports incrementing/decrementing quantities of selected items (variants) and confirms additions via an `onAdd` callback.
    *   Displays selected products or collections outside the modal, complete with images, names, and a delete option.
    *   Features a specific quantity input for collections if `collectionSpecificData` is provided, including validation against a minimum purchase quantity.
*   **Performance and User Experience:**
    *   Implements **debouncing** for search input to reduce API calls.
    *   Utilizes **infinite scrolling** for search results within the modal, managed by `useIntersectionObserver` to load more data as the user scrolls.
*   **State and Hooks:** Leverages `useState` for various states (loading, results, modal visibility, quantities) and `useRef` for DOM element references. It uses `useAppDispatch` for potential Redux interactions and `useIntersectionObserver` for scroll-based data fetching.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **`searchType` Conditional Logic:** The component frequently checks the `searchType` prop (`'products'` or `'collections'`) to adapt its API calls, data parsing, and rendering logic accordingly.
*   **Placeholder Images:** It consistently uses `ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage` and `ShopifyCollectionPlaceholderImage` for items missing image URLs.
*   **Agent-Led Filtering:** The `isAgentLed` prop dictates a specific filtering rule for items with 'no-agent' tags during data fetching.
*   **Modular UI Components:** The extensive imports from `gokwik-ui-kit` indicate a reliance on a shared UI library for consistent design and functionality.

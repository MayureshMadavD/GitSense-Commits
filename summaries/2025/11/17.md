# Activity Summary for 17/11/2025

## 11:13:19
The `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` file, last updated on 12/11/2025 at 21:20:24, is central to managing discounts and shipping options. Key updates include the clearing of the `captureApiTimerId` when discount coupons are removed, and a `confetti` animation being triggered for specific valid coupon code applications. The service now incorporates logic for `gyftr` (gift-as-a-product) to be removed or reapplied based on discount responses and the current checkout page. It also introduces logging for `loyalty_points_applied` events, tracking provider, redeemed credits, and auto-application status. A significant update involves a fix for `CHECKOUT-15842` to reapply gift cards if the cart has been modified, and a fix for `CHECKOUT-12982` to trigger payment method calls under specific conditions. Error messages are now managed more granularly, excluding failures related to UTM auto-application. The file also contains retry logic for shipping discounts.

The `PaymentOptions.svelte` file saw several updates between 13/11/2025, 20:56:52 and 13/11/2025, 21:25:07. This component orchestrates the payment selection UI, extensively importing and subscribing to numerous Svelte stores for common, order, and login-related states. During `onMount`, it initializes prepaid discount, fetches payment methods and previously used UPI IDs, processes saved cards, and sets the latest saved card. It dispatches GTM and Shopify analytics events on payment step landing. The component also handles various UI states, such as resetting loader, BIN response, and payment attempt states. Event logging for `prefilled_skip_to_pay` and `email_mismatch_message_shown` indicates detailed user journey tracking. Conditional `callPaymentMethods` execution is implemented based on the presence of `store_placeOrder` or `twidPay` status. It dynamically hides or shows UI elements related to payment panels based on allowed payment methods. A minor change on 13/11/2025, 21:22:28 added `store_availableOffersCheck` to its imports. A more substantial change on 15/11/2025, 12:01:15 included adding `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` imports, removing `calculateLoadTime`, `loadTimeVariables`, `PaymentAddressLazyLoad`, `SharePaymentLink`, `fetchShopifyCredits` imports, and integrating `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney` components, indicating a restructuring of how free gifts are presented within the payment options.

The `OrderSummary.svelte` file underwent changes between 15/11/2025, 11:49:48 and 15/11/2025, 11:52:44. This component focuses on displaying a detailed breakdown of the order. It imports Svelte lifecycle hooks, various stores, and utility functions. It exports `hideDiscountTab` and `componentData`. The component manages states for cart updates, gift additions, and order summary drawer visibility. A complex reactive block (`$:` statement) calculates the `totalPrice` by aggregating subtotal, various discounts (coupon, partner acquisition, discount-based rewards, Shopify store credit, prepaid), shipping, gift cards, COD charges, TwidPay rewards, GST, and Gyftr. The `handleCartUpdate` function, called on mount and on cart changes, processes the `cartjsObject` to extract and categorize items, including handling "buy X get Y" free products and gifts from `requestIdObject`, and calculating `automaticDiscount` and `totalItems`. It also now calculates and updates `loyaltyDisplayAmount` based on `earnedLoyaltyDetails` and `priceBreakUpData`.

A recurring pattern across these files is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores for managing and reacting to global application state, which is central to the UI's reactivity and data flow. All components demonstrate extensive event logging using services like GTM, GA4, Shopify Analytics, and Facebook, highlighting a strong focus on tracking user interactions and checkout performance. The presence of specific fixes (e.g., CHECKOUT-15842, CHECKOUT-12982) indicates ongoing refinement and maintenance. Furthermore, several experiment-related store imports suggest a culture of A/B testing and feature toggling to optimize the user experience. The asynchronous nature of many operations (e.g., API calls) is also a common theme, reflecting the dynamic, data-driven nature of the checkout process.

    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 21:20:24 & 15/11/2025, 12:00:15**
        This service manages shipping and discount logic. It imports numerous Svelte stores and services for state management and external API calls. Key functions `callShippingDiscountApi` and `processShippingDiscountResponse` handle the core logic. `callShippingDiscountApi` initiates discount/shipping calls, triggers confetti animations for specific discount types, manages Gyftr application/removal, and logs loyalty point events. `processShippingDiscountResponse` sets shipping and discount data, includes fixes for handling gift cards on cart updates (CHECKOUT-15842) and calling payment methods under certain conditions (CHECKOUT-12982), manages UI loaders, and handles error messages, particularly excluding those for UTM auto-application failures. The code content was identical between these two timestamps, suggesting a re-save or minor non-functional change.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp: 13/11/2025, 14:31:36**
        This HTML file defines a basic merchant page with a "click me" button to initiate the GoKwik checkout. It includes a JavaScript `gokwikSdk` that dynamically loads the `gokwik.js` script and provides methods for interacting with the checkout. It also includes functions for cookie management (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) and an embedded `window.merchantInfo` object for local development, specifying `environment: 'local'`, a `storeId`, and `fbpixel`.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:32:20**
        A minor change occurred, updating the `mid` value within the `window.merchantInfo` configuration from `'19g6ilvc699a0'` to `'eey3k3mkrg55tcs'`.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:01:29**

        Throughout this series of identical changes within the same day, this Svelte component for payment options was likely saved multiple times without functional code modifications. It involves extensive imports of Svelte stores related to login, order, and common application state. It declares numerous variables for payment methods, COD details, UI states, and analytics. The `onMount` lifecycle hook orchestrates many initializations and subscriptions, including processing saved cards, triggering analytics events, handling skip-to-payment scenarios, and reacting to changes in discounts, TwidPay, and Shopify store credits. A reactive block (`$:`) updates COD availability based on TwidPay.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 12:01:15**
        This update introduced new imports: `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` from `CommonStore`, `store_availableOffersCheck` from `OrderStore`, and two new components `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney`. This suggests new features related to automatic gifts or offers were being integrated, requiring additional state and UI components.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:49:48 & 15/11/2025, 11:52:44**
        Similar to `PaymentOptions.svelte`, this component shows identical code across two timestamps, indicating a re-save. This file is responsible for displaying the order summary. It imports stores for login, common, and order data, along with several child components. It manages the visibility of the order summary drawer (`toggleCartDrawer`), calculates the `totalPrice` reactively based on numerous factors like subtotal, various discounts (coupon, prepaid, loyalty, Shopify store credit, Gyftr), shipping charges, COD fees, and taxes. The `handleCartUpdate` function processes cart items, identifies automatic discounts, and segregates free products.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 14/11/2025, 13:55:06 & 17/11/2025, 13:00:33**
        This Svelte component is responsible for the overall merchant integration and checkout initiation. It imports numerous analytics services (CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, Facebook, GAanalytics, Contlo, GA4, etc.), helper functions, and environment-specific configurations. The `onMount` hook sets up environment variables, retrieves various tracking IDs and marketing data from cookies and URL parameters, checks for available UPI apps, and manages cash-to-prepaid configurations. It also handles message passing for `merchantInfo`, `cartOpen`, and `checkoutHealth` events. The code content was identical between these two timestamps, suggesting a re-save or minor non-functional change.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:05:00**
        This file defines integration with the Contlo analytics platform. It sets up a dummy `window.contlo` object for console logging events, and includes `createBody` to standardize data payloads with cart, user, marketing, and UTM information. The `callContlo` function dispatches various event types (`mobileAddedGK`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentCompleted`, `userAddress`, `coupon_applied_success_gk`, `coupon_applied_failed_gk`) to specific handlers which then construct and attempt to send the event data via `window.contlo.sendEvent`, with a console fallback if the SDK is not present.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:19:38 & 17/11/2025, 13:45:19 & 17/11/2025, 13:55:05**
        Multiple saves with minor changes. The change at 13:45:19 added a `console.log(data)` statement in the `contloAddressAdded` function, which was then changed to `console.log(dataObj)` at 13:55:05.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 14:07:01**
        The `createBody` function was updated to robustly handle the `cart_total_price` by checking if `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount` is a valid number before using it, falling back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price` otherwise. This improves data reliability for Contlo events.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 12:56:56 - 14:05:25**
        This service centralizes the logic for integrating with various foreign analytics platforms. It imports a wide array of Svelte stores to collect comprehensive data about the cart, user, marketing, and checkout flow. It maintains an `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` mapping and uses a `configObject` to enable or disable specific analytics pixels and events. It subscribes to nearly all relevant stores to generate common analytics data (`commonAnalyticsData`) and prepare data for different tracking events. Helper functions for Snapchat pixel checks, prefilled address status, URL decoding, and ad source mapping are also present. All timestamps in this range show identical code content, indicating multiple re-saves without functional changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Svelte Store Reliance:** A dominant pattern is the extensive use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_totalPrice`, `store_discountAmount`) for managing and sharing application state across components and services. Variables are declared and then updated via subscriptions to these stores.
*   **Analytics-Driven Development:** There is a significant focus on integrating and logging data for various analytics platforms (GTM, Shopify, CleverTap, Contlo, Facebook, GA4, etc.). Events are tracked at granular steps of the checkout process (mobile added, pincode added, payment method selected, discounts applied, address added, payment completed). This indicates a strong emphasis on user behavior tracking and conversion optimization.
*   **Checkout Flow Complexity:** The codebase reflects a complex checkout process involving multiple stages, discounts, loyalty programs, shipping options, and payment methods. The logic handles conditional flows, error management, and dynamic UI updates.
*   **Environment Specificity:** API endpoints and certain configurations (like Truecaller keys or merchant IDs in `merchant.html`) are frequently defined and updated based on the development environment (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`), highlighting a robust multi-environment deployment strategy.
*   **Frequent Re-saving:** Many files exhibit multiple timestamps with identical code, suggesting either automated formatting/linting on save or a developer habit of frequent saving during development without functional changes.
*   **Fixes/Enhancements (CHECKOUT-XXXX):** Explicit comments like "fix for CHECKOUT-15842" indicate a structured approach to bug fixing and feature development, likely using an issue tracking system.

    *   Leverages Ant Design's `Form` for managing input fields.
    *   Uses a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook to fetch and save merchant-specific custom UI configurations.
    *   The `onFinish` handler dispatches updates to the backend for the logo (`APIEndPoints.updateMerchant`) and saves the entire `custom_config` (including logo path and primary color) via `saveConfig`.
    *   Changes to form values (`brandData`) are dispatched to a Redux store (`updateBrandData`) to keep the application state synchronized.
*   **State Management:** Extensively uses `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and Redux selectors (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) to manage component state, merchant details, and configuration data.
*   **API Interactions:** Centralizes API calls using `makeAPICall` for various operations like downloading logo URLs, generating presigned upload URLs, and updating merchant data. It relies on `APIEndPoints` constants for endpoint definitions.
*   **User Feedback:** Provides error messages for invalid uploads and uses an `isVisible` state to enable/disable the "Save Changes" button based on form modifications.
*   **UI Components:** Consistently uses components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Row`, `Col`, `InfoComponent`) for a cohesive user interface.

The recurring pattern observed is the robust handling of image uploads, involving validation, client-side processing, secure cloud storage interaction via presigned URLs, and integration with both local component state and a global Redux store for data management.

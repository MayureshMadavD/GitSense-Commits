# Activity Summary for 17/11/2025

## 11:13:19
The `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` file, last updated on 12/11/2025 at 21:20:24, is central to managing discounts and shipping options. Key updates include the clearing of the `captureApiTimerId` when discount coupons are removed, and a `confetti` animation being triggered for specific valid coupon code applications. The service now incorporates logic for `gyftr` (gift-as-a-product) to be removed or reapplied based on discount responses and the current checkout page. It also introduces logging for `loyalty_points_applied` events, tracking provider, redeemed credits, and auto-application status. A significant update involves a fix for `CHECKOUT-15842` to reapply gift cards if the cart has been modified, and a fix for `CHECKOUT-12982` to trigger payment method calls under specific conditions. Error messages are now managed more granularly, excluding failures related to UTM auto-application. The file also contains retry logic for shipping discounts.

The `PaymentOptions.svelte` file saw several updates between 13/11/2025, 20:56:52 and 13/11/2025, 21:25:07. This component orchestrates the payment selection UI, extensively importing and subscribing to numerous Svelte stores for common, order, and login-related states. During `onMount`, it initializes prepaid discount, fetches payment methods and previously used UPI IDs, processes saved cards, and sets the latest saved card. It dispatches GTM and Shopify analytics events on payment step landing. The component also handles various UI states, such as resetting loader, BIN response, and payment attempt states. Event logging for `prefilled_skip_to_pay` and `email_mismatch_message_shown` indicates detailed user journey tracking. Conditional `callPaymentMethods` execution is implemented based on the presence of `store_placeOrder` or `twidPay` status. It dynamically hides or shows UI elements related to payment panels based on allowed payment methods. A minor change on 13/11/2025, 21:22:28 added `store_availableOffersCheck` to its imports. A more substantial change on 15/11/2025, 12:01:15 included adding `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` imports, removing `calculateLoadTime`, `loadTimeVariables`, `PaymentAddressLazyLoad`, `SharePaymentLink`, `fetchShopifyCredits` imports, and integrating `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney` components, indicating a restructuring of how free gifts are presented within the payment options.

The `OrderSummary.svelte` file underwent changes between 15/11/2025, 11:49:48 and 15/11/2025, 11:52:44. This component focuses on displaying a detailed breakdown of the order. It imports Svelte lifecycle hooks, various stores, and utility functions. It exports `hideDiscountTab` and `componentData`. The component manages states for cart updates, gift additions, and order summary drawer visibility. A complex reactive block (`$:` statement) calculates the `totalPrice` by aggregating subtotal, various discounts (coupon, partner acquisition, discount-based rewards, Shopify store credit, prepaid), shipping, gift cards, COD charges, TwidPay rewards, GST, and Gyftr. The `handleCartUpdate` function, called on mount and on cart changes, processes the `cartjsObject` to extract and categorize items, including handling "buy X get Y" free products and gifts from `requestIdObject`, and calculating `automaticDiscount` and `totalItems`. It also now calculates and updates `loyaltyDisplayAmount` based on `earnedLoyaltyDetails` and `priceBreakUpData`.

A recurring pattern across these files is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores for managing and reacting to global application state, which is central to the UI's reactivity and data flow. All components demonstrate extensive event logging using services like GTM, GA4, Shopify Analytics, and Facebook, highlighting a strong focus on tracking user interactions and checkout performance. The presence of specific fixes (e.g., CHECKOUT-15842, CHECKOUT-12982) indicates ongoing refinement and maintenance. Furthermore, several experiment-related store imports suggest a culture of A/B testing and feature toggling to optimize the user experience. The asynchronous nature of many operations (e.g., API calls) is also a common theme, reflecting the dynamic, data-driven nature of the checkout process.

    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 21:20:24 & 15/11/2025, 12:00:15**
        This service manages shipping and discount logic. It imports numerous Svelte stores and services for state management and external API calls. Key functions `callShippingDiscountApi` and `processShippingDiscountResponse` handle the core logic. `callShippingDiscountApi` initiates discount/shipping calls, triggers confetti animations for specific discount types, manages Gyftr application/removal, and logs loyalty point events. `processShippingDiscountResponse` sets shipping and discount data, includes fixes for handling gift cards on cart updates (CHECKOUT-15842) and calling payment methods under certain conditions (CHECKOUT-12982), manages UI loaders, and handles error messages, particularly excluding those for UTM auto-application failures. The code content was identical between these two timestamps, suggesting a re-save or minor non-functional change.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp: 13/11/2025, 14:31:36**
        This HTML file defines a basic merchant page with a "click me" button to initiate the GoKwik checkout. It includes a JavaScript `gokwikSdk` that dynamically loads the `gokwik.js` script and provides methods for interacting with the checkout. It also includes functions for cookie management (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) and an embedded `window.merchantInfo` object for local development, specifying `environment: 'local'`, a `storeId`, and `fbpixel`.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:32:20**
        A minor change occurred, updating the `mid` value within the `window.merchantInfo` configuration from `'19g6ilvc699a0'` to `'eey3k3mkrg55tcs'`.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:01:29**

        Throughout this series of identical changes within the same day, this Svelte component for payment options was likely saved multiple times without functional code modifications. It involves extensive imports of Svelte stores related to login, order, and common application state. It declares numerous variables for payment methods, COD details, UI states, and analytics. The `onMount` lifecycle hook orchestrates many initializations and subscriptions, including processing saved cards, triggering analytics events, handling skip-to-payment scenarios, and reacting to changes in discounts, TwidPay, and Shopify store credits. A reactive block (`$:`) updates COD availability based on TwidPay.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 12:01:15**
        This update introduced new imports: `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` from `CommonStore`, `store_availableOffersCheck` from `OrderStore`, and two new components `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney`. This suggests new features related to automatic gifts or offers were being integrated, requiring additional state and UI components.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:49:48 & 15/11/2025, 11:52:44**
        Similar to `PaymentOptions.svelte`, this component shows identical code across two timestamps, indicating a re-save. This file is responsible for displaying the order summary. It imports stores for login, common, and order data, along with several child components. It manages the visibility of the order summary drawer (`toggleCartDrawer`), calculates the `totalPrice` reactively based on numerous factors like subtotal, various discounts (coupon, prepaid, loyalty, Shopify store credit, Gyftr), shipping charges, COD fees, and taxes. The `handleCartUpdate` function processes cart items, identifies automatic discounts, and segregates free products.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 14/11/2025, 13:55:06 & 17/11/2025, 13:00:33**
        This Svelte component is responsible for the overall merchant integration and checkout initiation. It imports numerous analytics services (CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, Facebook, GAanalytics, Contlo, GA4, etc.), helper functions, and environment-specific configurations. The `onMount` hook sets up environment variables, retrieves various tracking IDs and marketing data from cookies and URL parameters, checks for available UPI apps, and manages cash-to-prepaid configurations. It also handles message passing for `merchantInfo`, `cartOpen`, and `checkoutHealth` events. The code content was identical between these two timestamps, suggesting a re-save or minor non-functional change.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:05:00**
        This file defines integration with the Contlo analytics platform. It sets up a dummy `window.contlo` object for console logging events, and includes `createBody` to standardize data payloads with cart, user, marketing, and UTM information. The `callContlo` function dispatches various event types (`mobileAddedGK`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentCompleted`, `userAddress`, `coupon_applied_success_gk`, `coupon_applied_failed_gk`) to specific handlers which then construct and attempt to send the event data via `window.contlo.sendEvent`, with a console fallback if the SDK is not present.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:19:38 & 17/11/2025, 13:45:19 & 17/11/2025, 13:55:05**
        Multiple saves with minor changes. The change at 13:45:19 added a `console.log(data)` statement in the `contloAddressAdded` function, which was then changed to `console.log(dataObj)` at 13:55:05.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 14:07:01**
        The `createBody` function was updated to robustly handle the `cart_total_price` by checking if `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount` is a valid number before using it, falling back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price` otherwise. This improves data reliability for Contlo events.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 12:56:56 - 14:05:25**
        This service centralizes the logic for integrating with various foreign analytics platforms. It imports a wide array of Svelte stores to collect comprehensive data about the cart, user, marketing, and checkout flow. It maintains an `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` mapping and uses a `configObject` to enable or disable specific analytics pixels and events. It subscribes to nearly all relevant stores to generate common analytics data (`commonAnalyticsData`) and prepare data for different tracking events. Helper functions for Snapchat pixel checks, prefilled address status, URL decoding, and ad source mapping are also present. All timestamps in this range show identical code content, indicating multiple re-saves without functional changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Svelte Store Reliance:** A dominant pattern is the extensive use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_totalPrice`, `store_discountAmount`) for managing and sharing application state across components and services. Variables are declared and then updated via subscriptions to these stores.
*   **Analytics-Driven Development:** There is a significant focus on integrating and logging data for various analytics platforms (GTM, Shopify, CleverTap, Contlo, Facebook, GA4, etc.). Events are tracked at granular steps of the checkout process (mobile added, pincode added, payment method selected, discounts applied, address added, payment completed). This indicates a strong emphasis on user behavior tracking and conversion optimization.
*   **Checkout Flow Complexity:** The codebase reflects a complex checkout process involving multiple stages, discounts, loyalty programs, shipping options, and payment methods. The logic handles conditional flows, error management, and dynamic UI updates.
*   **Environment Specificity:** API endpoints and certain configurations (like Truecaller keys or merchant IDs in `merchant.html`) are frequently defined and updated based on the development environment (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`), highlighting a robust multi-environment deployment strategy.
*   **Frequent Re-saving:** Many files exhibit multiple timestamps with identical code, suggesting either automated formatting/linting on save or a developer habit of frequent saving during development without functional changes.
*   **Fixes/Enhancements (CHECKOUT-XXXX):** Explicit comments like "fix for CHECKOUT-15842" indicate a structured approach to bug fixing and feature development, likely using an issue tracking system.

    *   Leverages Ant Design's `Form` for managing input fields.
    *   Uses a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook to fetch and save merchant-specific custom UI configurations.
    *   The `onFinish` handler dispatches updates to the backend for the logo (`APIEndPoints.updateMerchant`) and saves the entire `custom_config` (including logo path and primary color) via `saveConfig`.
    *   Changes to form values (`brandData`) are dispatched to a Redux store (`updateBrandData`) to keep the application state synchronized.
*   **State Management:** Extensively uses `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, and Redux selectors (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) to manage component state, merchant details, and configuration data.
*   **API Interactions:** Centralizes API calls using `makeAPICall` for various operations like downloading logo URLs, generating presigned upload URLs, and updating merchant data. It relies on `APIEndPoints` constants for endpoint definitions.
*   **User Feedback:** Provides error messages for invalid uploads and uses an `isVisible` state to enable/disable the "Save Changes" button based on form modifications.
*   **UI Components:** Consistently uses components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Row`, `Col`, `InfoComponent`) for a cohesive user interface.

The recurring pattern observed is the robust handling of image uploads, involving validation, client-side processing, secure cloud storage interaction via presigned URLs, and integration with both local component state and a global Redux store for data management.

## 15:13:21
The provided logs detail several code changes across different files within the `gokwik.pdp` project, primarily focusing on discount logic, payment options, analytics integration, and environment configuration.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 12/11/2025, 21:20:24**
        *   This extensive update refactors and expands the `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` file.
        *   It introduces numerous Svelte stores (e.g., `store_codOtpRequired`, `store_fullScreenPopUp`, `store_discountExperimentFlag`, `store_utmDiscounts`, `store_minPrice`, `store_isSuccessFlowEnabled`, `store_bottomSheetState`, `store_gyftr`) for managing shared state related to shipping, discounts, and payment flow.
        *   New constants are defined by subscribing to these stores.
        *   A `processDiscountShippingQueue` is introduced to manage API responses.
        *   The `callShippingDiscountApi` function is updated to handle discount application (including confetti animation for successful applications for specific user types or if `show_discount_confetti` is true and `disable_discount_application` is false), loyalty discounts, and interactions with Gyftr (reapplying or removing based on discount and page state). It also includes logic for setting shipping methods and options.
        *   The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function is enhanced to manage shipping information, discount responses, gift card reapplication on cart updates, and error messages (with a special exclusion for UTM auto-application failures). It also updates the UI state for loaders and bottom sheets based on the response.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 12:00:15**
        *   This change is identical to the one on 12/11/2025, 21:20:24, indicating either a re-commit of the same changes or a file restoration/revert to this specific state. No functional difference is observed.

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 13/11/2025, 14:31:15**
        *   This file primarily defines environment-specific base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API, Cred, experiments, TwidPay, KP, CDN, analytics).
        *   It uses `env` variable (subscribed from `store_environment`) to dynamically set URLs for `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`, `hdev`, `ndev`, `qa-rto`, `qaone`, `qatwo`, `dev-core`, `qa-core`, `sandbox-core`, `pci-prod`, and `idev` environments.
        *   Comments show some `local` environment URLs were previously commented out, indicating flexibility in local development setup.
        *   It also defines `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` based on the environment.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:32:02**
        *   The `api_url` function's `local` environment URL has been changed. Previously, it had several commented-out options, with `https://api.gokwik.co` active. This update makes `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` the active URL for the `local` environment, while others remain commented.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:32:38**
        *   This change is identical to the one on 15/11/2025, 11:32:02. No functional difference.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:02:34**
        *   The `api_url` function's `local` environment URL has been updated again. It was `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` and is now changed back to `https://api.gokwik.co`.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp: 13/11/2025, 14:31:36**
        *   This HTML file serves as a merchant integration page, demonstrating how the `gokwikSdk` is initialized and interacts with the checkout flow.
        *   It defines a `gokwikSdk` object with `init`, `initCheckout`, `emit`, `on`, and `hideButton` methods.
        *   The `init` function dynamically loads `gokwik.js`.
        *   It includes logic to set `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` cookies.
        *   The `window.merchantInfo` object provides configuration (e.g., `mid`, `environment`, `storeId`, `fbpixel`). The `mid` (merchant ID) is commented out with various examples, but `gh0yshvkmca4pw4` is set for the button and then overridden in `window.merchantInfo` with `eey3k3mkrg55tcs` (a `qa` mid is commented). The `environment` is set to `'local'`.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:32:20**
        *   The `mid` in `window.merchantInfo` is changed from a commented `qa mid:'eey3k3mkrg55tcs'` to be the active `mid:'eey3k3mkrg55tcs'`, with `gh0yshvkmca4pw4` still on the button but no longer the active `mid` in the `merchantInfo` object. Other commented-out `mid` values remain unchanged.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:01:29**
        *   The `mid` in `window.merchantInfo` is changed from `'eey3k3mkrg55tcs'` to `'19g6jlssscg1r'`.

4.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 13/11/2025, 20:56:52**, **20:58:06**, **21:00:07**, **21:00:59**, **21:01:56**, **21:03:33**, **21:20:47**, **21:22:28**, **21:23:51**
        *   These timestamps show many minor changes on the same day for `PaymentOptions.svelte`. All these entries are identical in content except for the addition of `store_availableOffersCheck` in the last three timestamps within the `OrderStore` import list.
        *   The file manages payment options display and logic, integrating with various Svelte stores for state management (e.g., `store_skipToPayment`, `store_loader`, `store_twidPay`, `store_shopifyStoreCredit`, `store_offers`).
        *   It includes a reactive statement (`$:` block) to update `store_onpl`'s `isCodAvailable` based on `store_twidPay`'s applied reward.
        *   `onMount` hook performs several initializations: setting `prepaidDiscount` to 0, subscribing to `paymentMethods`, logging UPI presence, processing saved cards, firing GTM events, setting page name, and resetting payment-related error states.
        *   It orchestrates calls to `callPaymentMethods` based on `store_placeOrder` and `store_twidPay` states.
        *   It handles subscriptions for various stores to update local component state (e.g., `totalPrice`, `codChargesText`, `discountTitle`).
        *   It includes logic to hide PSP panels based on allowed payment methods and logs events for Bajaj EMI methods.
        *   The file shows a pattern of managing offers and recommended payment options through subscriptions and reordering.
        *   **Specific addition in the later timestamps (21:20:47, 21:22:28, 21:23:51):** `store_availableOffersCheck` is added to the import list from `common/stores/OrderStore`.
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 12:01:15**
        *   This update adds `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` to the import list from `common/stores/CommonStore`.
        *   It also introduces two new Svelte components: `AutomaticGiftHeader.svelte` and `GiftJourney.svelte`, and imports them. This suggests new UI elements related to automatic gift handling are being integrated into the payment options page.
        *   The `calculateLoadTime` helper service import is removed.

5.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 14/11/2025, 13:55:06**
        *   This Svelte component is the main merchant integration point, embedding the GoKwik iframe.
        *   It initializes analytics services (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GAAnalytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, edgetag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds).
        *   It manages cookies and query parameters to retrieve session IDs, campaign data (`mrid`, `gkref`, `src`, `ch`, `kwik`, `ScCid`, `isSameWindowRedirection`, `isSuccess`, `gokwikOid`, `so_token`).
        *   It handles messaging between the parent window and the GoKwik iframe, specifically for `merchantInfo`, `cartOpen`, and `checkoutHealth` events.
        *   It includes logic for Truecaller integration, determining the environment, and setting cash-to-prepaid configurations.
        *   The `truecallerConfig` object contains environment-specific keys for Truecaller.
        *   A list of `sessionIDFixMerchants` is present, likely for specific merchant IDs that require special handling of Shopify session cookies.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:00:33**
        *   This change is identical to the one on 14/11/2025, 13:55:06. No functional difference.

6.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:49:48**, **11:52:44**
        *   These two timestamps are identical.
        *   This Svelte component is responsible for displaying the order summary.
        *   It imports numerous Svelte stores from both `LoginStore` and `CommonStore` to gather data like `orderType`, `cartjsObject`, `discountBasedRewards`, `selectedShippingMethod`, `totalPrice`, `gstInfo`, `gyftr`, `shopifyStoreCredit`, `earnedLoyaltyDetails`, and `priceBreakUp`.
        *   It defines reactive variables for `totalPrice`, `subTotal`, `couponDiscount`, `prepaidDiscount`, `codCharges`, `shippingInfo`, `giftcardTotal`, `automaticDiscount`, `loyaltyDisplayAmount`, and other price breakdown elements.
        *   The `totalPrice` calculation is complex, considering various discounts (coupon, partner acquisition offer, discount-based rewards, Shopify store credit, prepaid discount, gift card, TwidPay reward, Gyftr), shipping charges, COD charges, and GST.
        *   The `onMount` hook subscribes to several stores and calls `handleCartUpdate` on cart changes.
        *   `handleCartUpdate` processes cart items, identifies free products (for BXGY deals, prepaid discounts, auto gifts), and updates `subTotal` and `automaticDiscount`.
        *   It calculates `totalItems` in the cart.
        *   It includes logic for displaying a new order summary for specific page numbers.
        *   It also calculates `loyaltyDisplayAmount` based on `priceBreakUpData` and `earnedLoyaltyDetails`.

7.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 12:56:56**, **13:43:21**, **13:44:00**, **13:44:52**, **14:05:25**
        *   These timestamps show several identical updates.
        *   This service handles integration with various foreign analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Wigzo, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds).
        *   It consolidates data from numerous Svelte stores related to user information, cart details, discounts, shipping, and payment.
        *   It defines a `priceBreakup` object to track `line_items_subtotal`, `order_total`, `total_discount`, `shipping_charges`, `cod_fee`, `gift_card_and_reward`, and `tax`.
        *   It includes `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` for mapping checkout events to Facebook pixel custom events.
        *   The `adSourceMapping` function is used to parse UTM parameters from the source string.
        *   `generateTrackingData` and `createDataObject` functions are central to preparing data for different analytics platforms.
        *   It also handles `kwikOptimizerPixelIds` for enabling custom Facebook pixel events.
        *   The multiple identical entries suggest a period of rapid development, saving, or an automated process.

8.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:05:00**
        *   This file integrates Contlo analytics. It defines a dummy `window.contlo` object for development/testing purposes, logging calls to `init`, `identify`, `track`, and `push`.
        *   The `createBody` function compiles analytics data from `commonAnalyticsData` (including product IDs, promo code, cart total, marketing data like UTMs) and other event-specific data.
        *   `callContlo` acts as a dispatcher for different Contlo events: `mobileAddedGK`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentCompleted`, `userAddress`, and `coupon_applied_success_gk`/`coupon_applied_failed_gk`.
        *   Separate functions (`contloMobile`, `contloPincode`, `contloPaymentMethod`, `contloPaymentCompleted`, `contloAddressAdded`, `contloDiscountEvent`) prepare specific data payloads for each event.
        *   `contloSendEvent` attempts to call `window.contlo.sendEvent`, with a fallback `console.log` if the SDK is not found.
        *   A notable detail is `cart_total_price` in `createBody` uses `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount`.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:19:38**
        *   This change removes the dummy `window.contlo` object definition from the top of the file. This implies that the actual Contlo SDK is expected to be loaded externally, and the `try-catch` block in `contloSendEvent` will now handle cases where `window.contlo` is genuinely absent. No other functional changes.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:45:19**
        *   Adds a `console.log(data)` statement inside the `contloAddressAdded` function, likely for debugging purposes.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 13:55:05**
        *   Removes the `console.log(data)` statement from `contloAddressAdded`, reverting it to the previous state. This suggests the debugging step was temporary.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 14:07:01**
        *   Modifies the `cart_total_price` calculation within the `createBody` function. It now includes a check to ensure `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount` is a valid number before using it, otherwise falling back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price`. This adds robustness to the data being sent to Contlo.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 14:13:04**
        *   Further refines the `cart_total_price` calculation in `createBody`. It now explicitly stores `Number(commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount)` into a `discountedAmount` variable and uses `!!commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount && !isNaN(discountedAmount) ? discountedAmount : commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price`. This is a more explicit and robust check for the validity of `cart_after_discount`.
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 14:13:49**, **14:14:00**
        *   These two changes are identical to the one on 17/11/2025, 14:13:04. No functional difference.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **12/11/2025, 21:20:24:** Major refactor and expansion of shipping/discount logic in `ShippingDiscount.service.ts`, introducing a queue for API responses and complex discount/gift card handling.
*   **13/11/2025, 14:31:15:** Comprehensive environment configuration in `EnvironmentService.ts`.
*   **13/11/2025, 14:31:36:** Initial version of `merchant.html` showing SDK integration and merchant configuration.
*   **13/11/2025, 20:56:52 - 21:23:51:** Consecutive, minor updates to `PaymentOptions.svelte`, mostly related to store imports, with `store_availableOffersCheck` added in later revisions.
*   **14/11/2025, 13:55:06:** `Merchant.svelte` shows full analytics integration and core SDK launch logic.
*   **15/11/2025, 11:32:02:** `EnvironmentService.ts` changes the local environment API URL from production to sandbox.
*   **15/11/2025, 11:32:20:** `merchant.html` updates the active `mid` in `window.merchantInfo`.
*   **15/11/2025, 11:49:48:** `OrderSummary.svelte` introduces a complex `totalPrice` calculation and extensive cart item processing, including free products and loyalty.
*   **15/11/2025, 12:01:15:** `PaymentOptions.svelte` integrates `store_isLoggedInUser`, `store_isCartUpdated`, and new components for `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney`, suggesting new features for gift handling.
*   **17/11/2025, 12:56:56:** `ForeignAnalytics.ts` demonstrates detailed analytics event tracking and data consolidation. This file sees multiple identical commits afterward.
*   **17/11/2025, 13:02:34:** `EnvironmentService.ts` reverts the `local` environment API URL back to `https://api.gokwik.co`.
*   **17/11/2025, 13:19:38:** `Contlo.ts` removes the dummy Contlo SDK, indicating reliance on an external SDK load.
*   **17/11/2025, 14:07:01 & 14:13:04:** `Contlo.ts` introduces more robust error handling for `cart_total_price` data type.

### Patterns or Recurring Elements:

*   **Svelte Store Usage:** A prominent pattern across `.ts` and `.svelte` files is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_totalPrice`, `store_merchantInfo`) for managing global state and reactive data flow. Subscriptions to these stores are frequently used to update local component variables.
*   **Environment Configuration:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` files show a clear pattern of defining and switching URLs/keys based on the `env` variable (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.). This modular approach allows for easy deployment across different environments. Frequent changes in `EnvironmentService.ts` for the `local` environment's API URL suggest ongoing local development and testing with different backend setups.
*   **Analytics Integration:** Many files (`ShippingDiscount.service.ts`, `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Merchant.svelte`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`) demonstrate extensive integration with various analytics platforms (GTM, Shopify Analytics, Facebook, Google Ads, Contlo, etc.). Events are logged at different stages of the checkout process (payment step landed, discount applied, address added, mobile added). `ForeignAnalytics.ts` acts as a central hub for dispatching these events.
*   **Checkout Flow Logic:** There's a consistent focus on the checkout flow, including managing shipping options, applying discounts (manual and automatic), handling gift cards, and processing various payment methods (COD, UPI, TwidPay, Shopify Store Credit). Conditional logic based on page numbers (`currentPage`), user state (`isAbandonCart`), and merchant configurations (`skipToPayment`, `disable_discount_application`) is prevalent.
*   **Minor, Repetitive Updates:** Several files, especially `PaymentOptions.svelte` and `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, show sequences of nearly identical commits within a short timeframe (e.g., minutes). This could indicate frequent saving during development, automated formatting, or minor adjustments that didn't warrant distinct log messages. The addition of `store_availableOffersCheck` and removal of `console.log(data)` in `Contlo.ts` are examples of small, targeted changes.
*   **Robustness and Error Handling:** `Contlo.ts` demonstrates an evolution in robustness with improved checks for numeric values for `cart_total_price`, and `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` includes specific error message management and conditional handling for discount application failures.
*   **Dynamic UI/UX elements:** The mention of `confetti` for successful discounts, `bottomSheetState` for pop-ups, and `AutomaticGiftHeader`/`GiftJourney` components indicates a dynamic and interactive user experience.

## 16:03:58
The `brandPage.tsx` file, last updated on `16/11/2025, 13:10:34`, is a React component designed for customizing a checkout UI's brand elements, specifically focusing on logo and primary theme color.

**Key File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Logo Management:** The page includes functionality to upload a brand logo. It performs client-side validation for file type (JPEG, PNG, SVG) and size (under 2MB). Upon successful upload, the image is cleaned, a unique path is generated, a pre-signed AWS URL is fetched, and the image is uploaded to AWS S3. A base64 version is used for immediate preview.
*   **Theme Color Customization:** A `ColorPicketComponent` allows users to select a primary theme color, which is stored under `cssRules.primaryColor` within the merchant's custom configuration.
*   **Data Flow & State Management:**
    *   It integrates with Redux to fetch merchant details (`getMerchantDetails`) and update logo data (`updatedLogoData`, `updateBrandData`).
    *   A custom hook `useMerchantConfigApi` is used to fetch and save the merchant's custom configuration.
    *   Ant Design's `Form` component manages form state, with nested fields for `brand_data` including `logo`, `logoImg`, and `cssRules.primaryColor`.
*   **API Interactions:** The component uses `makeAPICall` for various operations, including checking logo presence, fetching pre-signed URLs, and updating merchant details. `makeAWSPutCall` is used for direct AWS S3 uploads.
*   **User Experience:** An `InfoComponent` provides context and a link to documentation. A "Save Changes" button is enabled only when form values have been modified, indicated by the `isVisible` state.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Gokwik UI Kit:** Extensive use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components (Button, Card, Form, Upload, message, etc.) for consistent UI.
*   **Centralized Utilities:** Relies on `@gokwik/utilities` for API calls (`makeAPICall`, `makeAWSPutCall`), image processing (`cleanImageWithCanvas`, `getBase64`), and constants (`APIEndPoints`).
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** The page fetches and updates `custom_config` data for the merchant, allowing for dynamic UI adjustments based on stored settings.
*   **Form Field Structure:** Frequent use of array notation for form field names (e.g., `['brand_data', 'logo']`) to manage nested form values.
*   **Environment Variable Usage:** API endpoints are consistently constructed using `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL`.

## 17:03:59
The changes primarily focus on two areas: UI customization for branding and enhancements to order and product management.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 16/11/2025, 13:10:34
    *   This file is responsible for the "Brand" page within the checkout dashboard's UI customization settings.
    *   Key functionality includes:
        *   **Logo Upload:** Allows merchants to upload their brand logo. It handles image validation (file types, size), temporary storage (uploading to AWS S3 via presigned URLs), and displaying a preview.
        *   **Primary Color Picker:** Provides a component (`ColorPicketComponent`) to select a primary theme color for the checkout UI, which is then saved to the merchant's custom configuration (`cssRules.primaryColor`).
        *   **Data Management:** Uses Redux (`updateBrandData`, `updatedLogoData`) and a custom API hook (`useMerchantConfigApi`) to fetch, save, and update merchant branding configurations.
        *   **Form Handling:** Utilizes Ant Design's `Form` component for managing input states and submission.
        *   **InfoComponent:** Includes a link to documentation for the "Brand Section".
        *   **Visibility Control:** A `useState` hook (`isVisible`) coupled with `onValuesChange` dynamically enables/disables the "Save Changes" button based on form edits.
        *   **API Interactions:** `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` are used for backend communication, particularly for logo image handling.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 16:22:51
    *   This component provides a reusable product/collection search functionality, likely used in discount creation or other product selection flows.
    *   Key functionality includes:
        *   **Search and Selection:** Allows searching for products or collections, displaying results in a modal, and selecting items.
        *   **Infinite Scrolling:** Implements `useIntersectionObserver` to load more items (`fetchData`) as the user scrolls, improving performance for large datasets.
        *   **Debounced Search:** Uses `setTimeout` for debouncing search input to reduce API calls.
        *   **Quantity Management:** Supports adding/removing items and managing quantities, especially for collated products or collections with specific quantity constraints.
        *   **Agent-Led Filtering:** Filters products based on tags for 'agent-led' scenarios (`no-agent` tag).
        *   **Gift Price Handling:** Specific logic for `topUpGift` to allow setting an offered price for gift items.
        *   **Collection Quantity Validation:** Includes logic to restrict collection quantities based on `collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity`.
        *   **UI Elements:** Uses `Input`, `Button`, `Modal`, `Checkbox`, `Skeleton` from `gokwik-ui-kit`.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 16:23:04
    *   This file renders the detailed view of a specific order in the dashboard.
    *   Key functionality includes:
        *   **Order Data Fetching:** Retrieves comprehensive order details using `makeAPICall`, including price breakdowns, transactions, and refunds.
        *   **Refund Management:**
            *   Displays merged refunds (`mergeRepeatedRefunds`) to show attempts and a simplified status.
            *   Manages the state of a "Refund" button (`refundBtnState`), disabling it if the refundable amount is zero or a refund is already in progress.
            *   Integrates a `RefundDrawer` component for initiating refunds.
        *   **Price Breakdowns:** Calculates and displays various price components like discounts, taxes, shipping, COD charges, gift cards, and rewards.
        *   **Currency Formatting:** Introduces `formatCurrency` and `formatAmountWithCurrency` to handle currency symbols dynamically based on order data or merchant configuration.
        *   **Order Status and Failure Reasons:** Displays order status using `Tag` components with color mapping and identifies potential order failure reasons.
        *   **Customer Information Masking/Display:** Masks customer phone numbers and emails initially, with options to view them.
        *   **Edit Order Logic:** Determines if an order can be edited based on applied rewards, GWP discounts, or loyalty points, setting `disableEdit` and `title` accordingly.
        *   **Permissions and Redux:** Uses Redux selectors (`isMerchantSelector`, `getMerchantPlatform`, `getUserConfig`, etc.) to get user and merchant-specific details, influencing UI and functionality (e.g., `showRTOActions`, `showRTOScoreToMerchant`).
        *   **User Logging:** `logEvent` is used to track user interactions.
        *   **Breadcrumbs:** `addBreadcrumb`, `updateBreadcrumbs` for navigation.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **16/11/2025, 13:10:34:** Focus on UI customization for branding (logo upload, theme color).
*   **17/11/2025, 16:22:51:** Enhancements to product/collection search, including infinite scroll, quantity management, and agent-led filtering.
*   **17/11/2025, 16:23:04:** Significant updates to order details page, covering refund logic, detailed price breakdowns, dynamic currency formatting, and display of order failure reasons.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Gokwik UI Kit Usage:** All files extensively use components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (e.g., `Button`, `Input`, `Form`, `Card`, `message`, `Table`, `Tabs`), indicating a standardized UI library across the dashboard.
2.  **API Interaction Utilities:** `makeAPICall` is consistently used for backend communication, often with `APIEndPoints` constants. `makeAWSPutCall` is specifically used for file uploads to AWS.
3.  **Redux for State Management:** `useAppDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks are prevalent for accessing and updating global state, particularly user and merchant configuration data (`@store/user/selectors`, `@store/customize-ui`).
4.  **Helper Functions & Constants:** Frequent imports from `@library/utilities/helpers/helper` (e.g., `getBase64`, `formatAmount`, `setCurrencySymbol`) and `@library/utilities/constants/constants` indicate a pattern of modularizing common logic and values.
5.  **Hooks for Component Logic:** `useEffect`, `useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useCallback` are widely used for managing component lifecycle, state, and performance optimization. Custom hooks like `useMerchantConfigApi` and `useIntersectionObserver` are also utilized.
6.  **Error Handling:** `try...catch` blocks and `message.error` are used to handle API call failures and display user-friendly error messages.
7.  **Dynamic UI Rendering:** Components often adapt their rendering based on props, user permissions, or fetched data (e.g., `hideButton`, `hideSearchInput`, `isAgentLed` in `ProductSearch`; `showRTOActions`, `refundBtnState` in `OrderDetails`).
8.  **Form Management:** `Form.useForm()` and `form.setFieldValue()` from Ant Design's Form library are standard for managing forms.

        *   A dummy `window.contlo` object was present in the earliest log for this file, but subsequent logs do not include it, suggesting it was for local development/testing and removed before release.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **12/11/2025, 21:20:24:** Major update to `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` with extensive state management, discount logic (including confetti effect), Gyftr integration, and fixes for cart/payment issues.
*   **13/11/2025, 14:31:15:** Initial log for `EnvironmentService.ts`, establishing a detailed environment-based URL and token management.
*   **13/11/2025, 14:31:36:** Initial log for `merchant.html`, setting up the basic merchant integration with Gokwik SDK and cookie handling.
*   **13/11/2025, 20:56:52 - 21:03:33:** Multiple identical saves/minor changes in `PaymentOptions.svelte`.
*   **13/11/2025, 21:22:28:** `PaymentOptions.svelte` adds `store_availableOffersCheck` import.
*   **14/11/2025, 13:55:06:** `Merchant.svelte` shows comprehensive analytics integration and setup for merchant-side checkout logic.
*   **15/11/2025, 11:32:02:** `EnvironmentService.ts` changes local API URL to sandbox.
*   **15/11/2025, 11:32:20:** `merchant.html` changes merchant ID for local environment.
*   **15/11/2025, 12:01:15:** `PaymentOptions.svelte` refines imports, removes commented out code, and adds new gift-related components and reactive logic for recommended options.
*   **15/11/2025, 11:49:48:** Initial log for `OrderSummary.svelte`, outlining detailed order price breakdown and loyalty calculations.
*   **17/11/2025, 12:56:56:** Initial log for `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, demonstrating deep integration with various analytics platforms.
*   **17/11/2025, 13:02:34:** `EnvironmentService.ts` reverts local API URL back to production.
*   **17/11/2025, 13:01:29:** `merchant.html` changes merchant ID for local environment again.
*   **17/11/2025, 13:05:00:** `Contlo.ts` starts logging, showing event tracking functions, and later `createBody` function is updated for robust price handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Svelte Store Reliance:** A strong pattern across `.ts` and `.svelte` files is the heavy use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) for global state management. This indicates a reactive, component-based architecture where data flows are managed centrally.
*   **Checkout/Payment Flow:** Many files are directly related to the e-commerce checkout and payment process, handling discounts, shipping, payment options, order summaries, and analytics events at different stages.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` consistently show configurations that vary based on the deployment environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production), especially for API endpoints and merchant IDs. This is crucial for managing different development, testing, and production setups.
*   **Analytics Integration:** There's a comprehensive integration with multiple third-party analytics services (Contlo, Facebook, Google Analytics, Snapchat, etc.), evidenced by imports in `Merchant.svelte` and the detailed event tracking in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `Contlo.ts`. Data points like `utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `landing_page`, `origin_referrer` are consistently captured for marketing analysis.
*   **Discount and Reward Management:** Logic for applying, reapplying, and removing various types of discounts, gift cards, loyalty points (TwidPay), and Gyftr is prevalent, highlighting a feature-rich discount system. Confetti animation on discount success is a recurring detail.
*   **Error Handling and User Experience:** Presence of `ErrorMessage.svelte`, `snackbar_state`, `loader`, and `persistedErrorMessage` indicates consideration for user feedback and error handling during asynchronous operations.
*   **Iterative Development/Refinement:** Multiple identical log entries for the same file within a short timeframe (e.g., `PaymentOptions.svelte` and `ForeignAnalytics.ts`) suggest frequent saves, minor adjustments, or automated formatting. Changes in merchant IDs in `merchant.html` also point to frequent testing with different merchant configurations.
*   **Dependency on External SDKs:** The `Contlo.ts` changes and the general structure imply a reliance on external SDKs (like Contlo, Truecaller, various analytics pixels) for core functionalities.
*   **Performance and Load Time:** References to `performance.now()` in `PaymentOptions.svelte` and `calculateLoadTime` (though commented out later) suggest an emphasis on optimizing performance and tracking load times.

## 22:11:25
The code changes detail significant updates across three different parts of the checkout dashboard UI, primarily focusing on merchant-facing customization, discount management, and order details. All changes occurred within a short span, from November 16-17, 2025, indicating a focused development effort.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx` (Timestamp: 16/11/2025, 13:10:34)**
    *   **Purpose:** This page allows merchants to customize their checkout UI's branding elements.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **UI Customization:** Introduced functionality for merchants to upload their brand logo and select a primary theme color for the checkout UI.
        *   **Image Upload:** Implemented a robust image upload mechanism that includes validation for file types (JPEG, PNG, SVG) and size (under 2MB), cleaning images with `cleanImageWithCanvas`, and uploading them to AWS S3 using presigned URLs.
        *   **API Integration:** Fetches existing logo data and updates merchant configuration with the new logo and `cssRules` (specifically `primaryColor`).
        *   **State Management:** Uses Redux (`updatedLogoData`, `updateBrandData`) to manage logo and brand-related state, and `useMerchantConfigApi` for fetching and saving merchant-specific configurations.
        *   **Form Handling:** Utilizes `gokwik-ui-kit`'s `Form` component with `onFinish` and `onValuesChange` to enable or disable the "Save Changes" button based on form modifications.
        *   **Information Display:** Includes an `InfoComponent` linking to documentation for context.

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:22:51)**
    *   **Purpose:** A reusable component for searching and selecting products or collections, likely used in discount creation or other item-specific configurations.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **Enhanced Search Functionality:** Supports searching for both products and collections with pagination and infinite scrolling using `useIntersectionObserver`. Includes debounced search input to optimize API calls.
        *   **Product Variant Handling:** Can collate products by their parent product ID, displaying the number of variants selected, and allows for variant-specific quantity management.
        *   **Conditional Features:** Introduced props for hiding search elements (`hideSearch`, `hideSearchInput`, `hideButton`), enabling quantity input (`showQuantity`), and specific agent-led filtering (`isAgentLed` to filter out 'no-agent' tagged items).
        *   **Gift & Collection-Specific Data:** Added `topUpGift` functionality to allow setting an `offered_price` for gift items and `collectionSpecificData` to manage collection quantities with minimum purchase requirements and validations.
        *   **Placeholder Images:** Uses `ShopifyCollectionPlaceholderImage` and `ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage` for improved UX.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:23:04)**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a detailed view of a specific order, including financial breakdowns, customer information, and refund management.
    *   **Key Changes:**
        *   **Comprehensive Order Data Display:** Fetches and displays extensive order details, including price breakups for discounts, taxes, shipping, COD charges, gift cards, and rewards.
        *   **Advanced Refund Logic:** Introduces `mergeRepeatedRefunds` to consolidate multiple refund attempts into a single view, showing the primary status and number of attempts. Calculates the `refundableAmount` and dynamically controls the refund button's disabled state.
        *   **Dynamic Currency Formatting:** Implements custom `formatCurrency` and `formatAmountWithCurrency` helpers to ensure correct currency symbols (retrieved from order data or merchant details) are displayed globally.
        *   **Order Editing Restrictions:** Added `setEditTitle` logic to disable order editing and display tooltips if Twid rewards, specific GWP discounts, or Loyalty Points are applied to the order.
        *   **Security & Permissions:** Masks customer phone and email by default, with buttons to view the full details (`showViewPhoneBtn`, `showViewEmailBtn`). Incorporates `validatePermission` and `logEvent` for internal team actions related to RTO (Return to Origin) management, including displaying `RTO_FAKE_ORDER_REASONS`.
        *   **Breadcrumbs:** Uses `addBreadcrumb` and `updateBreadcrumbs` for navigation context.
        *   **Authorization:** Handles `KwikCodLite` authorization for specific internal scenarios.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Gokwik-UI-Kit Adoption:** All files heavily leverage components from `gokwik-ui-kit`, indicating a consistent use of a standardized UI library across the dashboard.
*   **Centralized Utilities:** There's a strong reliance on custom utility functions for common tasks:
    *   **API Interaction:** `makeAPICall`, `makeAWSPutCall` are frequently used for data fetching and submission, often interacting with `APIEndPoints` and `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL`.
    *   **Helper Functions:** Functions like `formatAmount`, `setCurrencySymbol`, `getBase64`, `cleanImageWithCanvas`, `findOrderFailureReason` are used across different contexts to ensure consistency in data processing and display.
*   **Redux for Global State:** `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch` are consistently employed to access and update global state, particularly for merchant and user configurations.
*   **Robust React Hook Usage:** `useEffect`, `useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` are fundamental to managing component lifecycle, state, and optimizing performance.
*   **Router Integration:** `react-router-dom` hooks are used for seamless navigation and parameter extraction within the application.
*   **Focus on Merchant Configuration:** A significant theme is allowing merchants to customize and configure aspects of their checkout experience, whether it's branding or discount rules, with corresponding UI and API integration.
*   **Detailed Data Presentation:** Components are designed to present complex data (like order price breakups or product details) clearly, often involving calculations and conditional rendering.
*   **Timestamp Consistency:** The timestamps for all three files fall on November 16-17, 2025, suggesting a concerted effort to release or update these specific dashboard features around that period.

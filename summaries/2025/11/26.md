# Activity Summary for 26/11/2025

## 11:03:11
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`**: This file contains utility functions `makeAPICall` and `logUserEvent`.
    *   **`makeAPICall` function**: This function handles API requests using Axios, incorporating features such as:
        *   Security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).
        *   Conditional `withCredentials` based on `skipCookies`.
        *   Loader management (`loaderEvent`).
        *   Special handling for internal users, preventing non-GET operations on specific URLs.
        *   Support for single and multiple file uploads with custom field names.
        *   Robust error handling, particularly for 401 Unauthorized responses, which clears `localStorage` tokens and redirects users to the login page, while preserving the original URL if necessary.
    *   **`logUserEvent` function**: This function is designed to log user interaction events. It includes logic to:
        *   Gather user data (email, name, role) and merchant data (ID, name).
        *   Generate a unique `userSessionId` using `nanoid` and store it in a cookie if one doesn't exist.
        *   Determine the `landing_page` from the `window.location.pathname`.
        *   Parse the `userAgentString` to extract details about the operating system, device, OS version, browser, browser version, and detect if it's a webview (`is_wv`).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

All changes occurred on **22/11/2025** within a short span of time, focusing on the error handling within the `makeAPICall` function's `catch` block.

*   **17:38:55**: The initial state of the `catch` block for 401 errors in `makeAPICall` returned `{ ...error, error: true }`.
*   **17:39:07**: This timestamp marks a modification to the 401 error handling. The return statement was updated to explicitly provide an error message: `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This aimed to give more user-friendly or specific error feedback.
*   **17:39:40**: The code was reverted to its state at 17:38:55. The `catch` block for 401 errors once again returned `{ ...error, error: true }`, undoing the change made moments before.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration/Reversion**: The timestamps indicate a very quick change and subsequent reversion of the error handling logic, suggesting either testing, a temporary bug fix, or a change of mind regarding the desired error structure for 401 responses.
*   **Comprehensive Utility Design**: The `common.ts` file acts as a central place for critical dashboard functionalities, handling both network communication (`makeAPICall`) and analytics/tracking (`logUserEvent`).
*   **Security Best Practices**: The `makeAPICall` function includes several standard security headers, demonstrating an emphasis on protecting against common web vulnerabilities.
*   **User/Merchant Context**: Both functions extensively leverage `dashboardStore` to access `userData` and `merchantData`, ensuring that API calls and event logs are made within the appropriate user and merchant context.
*   **Cookie Management**: The use of `getCookie` and `setCookie` for `userSessionId` indicates reliance on client-side cookies for session tracking.

## 11:52:58
The log captures changes across a dashboard application, primarily focusing on frontend configuration and shipping/discount validation logic.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:17:41**: The initial state of this EJS template defines the application's base HTML, CSP, and `systemjs-importmap` configurations. It includes conditional imports for `@gokwik` modules based on `isLocal`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, and `production` environments, with production including New Relic and Microsoft Clarity tracking. The `isLocal` environment initially points `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:50:58**: The `isLocal` environment configuration was updated, changing the source for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` from `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` to `dev-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:52:06**: Further adjustments were made to the `isLocal` environment, directing `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` to `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:53:39**: The `isLocal` environment's `systemjs-importmap` for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` was reverted to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`, effectively returning to its initial `sandbox` configuration.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:31:55**: This React component is introduced, designed for configuring shipping methods. It contains form fields for shipping name, price, min/max order values, and advanced conditions. It includes functionality for uploading/downloading CSVs (e.g., pincodes) and API calls for customer segments and presigned URLs for file uploads.
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:36:01**: No functional code changes were observed in this update.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:45:40**: This file defines various validation functions (`validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, `validateBuyXatYDiscount`, `validateDiscountCapping`, `validateGWP`) used across the application. These functions enforce rules like unique codes, valid ranges (e.g., upper limit > lower limit), and preventing range overlaps for different discount and shipping tiers.
    *   **Subsequent timestamps (24/11/2025, 12:47:57 to 24/11/2025, 17:34:51)**: No functional code changes were observed across multiple updates, suggesting repeated saving, minor formatting changes, or reversion of test modifications. The core validation logic remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:16:01**: This React component, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, is added to handle weight-based shipping configurations. It features a form for defining shipping name, ID, min/max weight, and price, along with a table for managing existing rates. It uses `validateWeightRangeDifference` for form validation.
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:23:28**: No functional code changes were observed in this update.
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:27:43**: The `validateWeightRangeDifference` function call within `getValesFromForm` was modified to pass an additional boolean argument (`isEditEnabled` or `false`), providing context for add vs. edit operations.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:40:20**: A `console.log(weightConfig)` statement was removed from the `if (isEditEnabled)` block in `getValesFromForm`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:49:44**: The `if (isEditEnabled)` block in `getValesFromForm` was further refined to filter existing shipping rates before re-validating the updated configuration.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:07:59**: The `validateWeightRangeDifference` call for adding new entries was changed to explicitly pass `weightConfig.weight_based_shipping_rates` instead of the entire `weightConfig` object.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:20:50**: The validation logic for new entries was temporarily refactored to call `validateWeightRangeDifference` twice (once for `min_weight`, once for `max_weight` with fewer arguments), and error message handling was updated.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:24:39**: The validation logic for new entries was reverted or corrected, returning to a single `validateWeightRangeDifference` call with 4 arguments.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:15:07**: A `console.log(weightConfigs, "===")` was added to the `useEffect` hook.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:19:27**: The `useEffect` hook's `setWeightConfig` logic was updated to conditionally use `weightConfigs` only if it has elements, preventing overwriting with an empty array. The debug `console.log` was slightly adjusted.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:19:36**: The `console.log` statement was removed from the `useEffect` hook.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:17:43**: This `ShippingService` component is introduced, acting as a container for different shipping configuration tabs: "Shipping Method", "Weight Based Shipping", and "Discount Based Shipping". It conditionally renders a `ShippingMethodConfig` if no shipping prices are present.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:29:59**: A new tab, "Product Based Shipping", was added (key '2'), conditionally rendered based on `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service`. This shifted the keys for "Weight Based Shipping" to '3' and "Discount Based Shipping" to '4', with corresponding updates in the `handleTabChange` function.
    *   **25/11/2025, 13:00:14**: A minor formatting change was made to the `Tabs` component's props order (`destroyInactiveTabPane` reordered).

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
    *   **25/11/2025, 12:58:37**: This `ProductSearch` React component is added, enabling search and selection of products or collections. It includes features like debounced search, infinite scrolling, managing quantities for selected items, "top-up gift" pricing, and agent-led product filtering.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **25/11/2025, 12:59:31**: This file is introduced, centralizing numerous API endpoints related to orders, customers, shipping, taxes, analytics, discounts, Shopify integrations, and merchant configurations.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **25/11/2025, 12:59:47**: This file provides utility functions for abstracting API calls, including `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (which handles pagination, active status filtering, and data transformation), `updateMerchantData`, `validateGstData`, and `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Timestamping:** All changes are precisely timestamped (`DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS`).
*   **Environment Configuration Focus:** The `index.ejs` and `.env` files show frequent modifications related to switching or defining environment-specific URLs (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`) for various `@gokwik` modules and API endpoints. This suggests active development, testing, and deployment to different environments.
*   **Shipping and Discount Feature Development:** A significant portion of changes is concentrated in the `checkout-dashboard-ui` module, specifically around shipping settings (`shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `weightShipping.tsx`, `shippingBasedService.tsx`) and general validation (`validations.ts`). This indicates ongoing development and refinement of these core features.
*   **Validation Logic Refinements:** The `validations.ts` file, while appearing mostly static in content, is frequently saved. This, combined with targeted adjustments in `weightShipping.tsx` to how validation functions are called (`validateWeightRangeDifference`), suggests continuous iteration on input validation rules and mechanisms.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The presence of multiple `.tsx` files (React components) managing specific UI/feature areas (e.g., `ShippingMethodConfig`, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, `ProductSearch`, `ShippingService`) points to a component-driven or micro-frontend development approach.
*   **API Centralization:** The `apiEndpoints.ts` file acts as a central repository for all backend API routes, which is then consumed by API utility functions in `api.ts`.
*   **Gokwik Ecosystem:** The code consistently refers to "Gokwik" components, UI kits, and API domains, indicating development within a larger "Gokwik" platform.
*   **Debugging and Cleanup:** The insertion and removal of `console.log` statements in `weightShipping.tsx` indicates active debugging during development.

## 12:03:09
For the file `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`, the log shows a series of rapid updates on 22/11/2025, specifically regarding error handling in the `makeAPICall` function.

At 17:38:55, the `makeAPICall` function's `catch (error)` block for a `401` status code was configured to return the entire error object along with an `error: true` flag: `return { ...error, error: true }`.

A significant change occurred at 17:39:07. The `401` error handling in `makeAPICall` was modified to explicitly return an `error: true` flag and a `message` derived from the error response data, falling back to the generic error message if specific data isn't available: `return { error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This indicates an intention to provide a more specific error message to the caller.

However, shortly after, at 17:39:40, this specific change was reverted. The code for the `401` error handling in `makeAPICall` returned to its initial state from 17:38:55, once again returning the full error object: `return { ...error, error: true }`.

Across all these entries, the `APIRequestConfig` interface, the `internalUserPostUrls` array, and the overall structure and logic of `makeAPICall` (except for the mentioned `401` error return) remain consistent. A recurring element observed is that the `parseUserAgent` function within `logUserEvent` is consistently truncated at the end across all provided log entries.

## 13:03:14
In `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`, the `makeAPICall` function, responsible for handling Axios-based API requests, underwent a modification and subsequent reversion within a short timeframe.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Initial State (22/11/2025, 17:38:55):** The `makeAPICall` function was established to handle secure API interactions. This included enforcing restrictions for internal users on non-GET requests, setting robust security headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`), managing file uploads (both single and multiple), controlling UI loaders, and specifically handling 401 Unauthorized errors by clearing the local storage token and redirecting to the login page under certain conditions. Upon a 401 error, it returned a generic error object: `{ ...error, error: true }`.
*   **Intermediate Update (22/11/2025, 17:39:07):** A specific change was introduced to the error handling within the `makeAPICall` function. For 401 Unauthorized responses, the function was updated to return a more structured error object, explicitly extracting the message from the response: `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This aimed to provide clearer error feedback.
*   **Reversion (22/11/2025, 17:39:40):** Shortly after the intermediate update, the change was reverted. The `makeAPICall` function's 401 error handling mechanism was restored to its original state, once again returning the full error object: `{ ...error, error: true }`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

The file `common.ts` primarily focuses on two asynchronous functions: `makeAPICall` for network requests and `logUserEvent` for user activity logging. The changes specifically impacted the `makeAPICall` function's error response structure during a 401 Unauthorized scenario. The `logUserEvent` function, which prepares user event data including a user agent parser, remained unchanged (and appears incomplete/truncated in all log entries).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:07:** Introduction of a more specific error message structure for 401 API errors.
*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:40:** Reversion of the error message structure for 401 API errors back to the initial, more generic format.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The recurring pattern observed is the instability or immediate reconsideration of the error handling strategy within the `makeAPICall` function for 401 Unauthorized responses. This suggests an ongoing refinement or debate over how errors should be presented and handled at the API utility layer. The repeated nature of the `logUserEvent` function's truncated state also implies that part of the code might be a work in progress or not fully logged.

## 14:03:15
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`, across three timestamps on 22/11/2025.

**File-specific Updates and Timestamps:**

*   **22/11/2025, 17:38:55:** This entry establishes the initial state of the `common.ts` file. It includes:
    *   An `APIRequestConfig` interface for defining API call parameters.
    *   A `makeAPICall` asynchronous function that acts as an Axios wrapper. This function handles various concerns such as:
        *   Restricting non-GET operations for "internal users" on specific predefined URLs.
        *   Configuring Axios instances with a base URL from `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and setting several security-related HTTP headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` for non-development environments).
        *   Managing loading states via `loaderEvent`.
        *   Appending a `mode` parameter to requests based on user data.
        *   Supporting both single and multiple file uploads using `FormData`.
        *   Implementing comprehensive error handling, specifically for `401 Unauthorized` responses, which triggers a redirection to the `/login` page after clearing the local storage token, while skipping redirection for certain paths.
        *   Resetting a timer via `timerEvent(null)` upon successful completion.
    *   An `EventsInterface` for logging user events.
    *   A `logUserEvent` asynchronous function containing helper functions like `getFixedParams` (to gather common event parameters such as `tracking_id`, `request_id` derived from email, a session ID generated with `nanoid` and stored in a cookie, and merchant/user details) and an incomplete `parseUserAgent` function for extracting browser and OS information.

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:07:** A minor but significant change was introduced in the `makeAPICall` function. Within the `catch` block, specifically for `401 Unauthorized` errors, the return statement was modified from `return { ...error, error: true }` to `return { error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This update aimed to provide a more structured error response, explicitly including an `error` flag and a user-friendly `message` from the API response or the general error.

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:40:** This entry shows a reversion to the code state found at 17:38:55. The change made at 17:39:07 to the 401 error handling was removed, and the `makeAPICall` function reverted to returning the spread `error` object (`{ ...error, error: true }`) for `401` status codes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration:** The three timestamps are very close together (within 45 seconds), indicating rapid saving or minor adjustments during development.
*   **Consistent Core Logic:** Despite a brief alteration, the core functionality of `makeAPICall` and `logUserEvent` remains largely unchanged across all entries. This suggests that the primary purpose and structure of these utility functions are stable.
*   **Incomplete Function:** The `parseUserAgent` function within `logUserEvent` is consistently truncated at the end of the file in all logs, suggesting it was either under development or part of a larger change not fully captured.
*   **Security Focus:** The `makeAPICall` function consistently implements various security headers and includes logic for `withCredentials`, indicating a strong emphasis on securing API communications.
*   **User Experience (UX) Enhancements:** The presence of `loaderEvent` for visual feedback during API calls and the detailed `logUserEvent` for tracking user interactions highlights a focus on both UX and analytics.

## 14:59:16
No summarizable code changes were found as all provided log entries correspond to `.env` files, which are excluded from the summary per instructions.

## 15:03:15
The file `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts` primarily contains utility functions for making API calls and logging user events within a dashboard application.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The core functionality of the `common.ts` file involves:

*   **`makeAPICall` function:** This asynchronous function handles various API interactions using Axios. It includes:
    *   An `APIRequestConfig` interface to define flexible API request parameters, including support for single and multiple file uploads.
    *   Security measures, such as preventing internal users from performing disallowed non-GET operations and setting various HTTP security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` in production).
    *   Integration with a `loaderEvent` for managing loading states and `timerEvent` for timeouts.
    *   Conditional inclusion of a `mode` parameter for non-internal users.
    *   Comprehensive error handling, specifically for `401 Unauthorized` responses, which clears the user token, stores the current path for redirection, and navigates to the `/login` page, while carefully whitelisting certain paths to avoid premature redirects.
*   **`logUserEvent` function:** This function is designed to log user interaction events. It gathers extensive user and session details, including:
    *   `tracking_id` and `userSessionId` (generated with `nanoid` and stored in cookies if not present).
    *   User-specific information like email, merchant ID, merchant name, username, and role.
    *   Timestamp and landing page information.
*   **`parseUserAgent` function:** This utility within `logUserEvent` is responsible for parsing the `navigator.userAgent` string to extract details about the user's operating system, device, OS version, browser, browser version, and whether it's a webview.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:07:** A specific change was introduced in the `makeAPICall` function's error handling for `401 Unauthorized` responses. The return object for this error was modified from spreading the original error object (`{ ...error, error: true }`) to providing a more structured response with a specific message (`{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`).
*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:40:** The change made at 17:39:07 was reverted. The `makeAPICall` function's `401 Unauthorized` error handling returned to its previous state of spreading the error object and adding `error: true`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Consistent Structure:** The overall structure and imports of the `common.ts` file, including the `APIRequestConfig` interface, `internalUserPostUrls` array, and the main logic within `makeAPICall` and `logUserEvent` (excluding the specific error message change), remained consistent across all log entries.
*   **Incomplete Code Snippets:** The provided log entries consistently cut off the `logUserEvent` and `parseUserAgent` functions at the exact same point. This indicates that the latter parts of these functions were not included in the log or did not undergo changes within this specific timeframe.
*   **Focus on API Interaction and User Event Logging:** The file demonstrates a clear pattern of encapsulating common functionalities related to network requests (with loaders, security, and error handling) and user activity tracking.
*   **Environmental Variable Usage:** The `makeAPICall` function consistently uses `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and checks `process.env.NODE_ENV` for environment-specific configurations, indicating a standard practice for handling different deployment environments.

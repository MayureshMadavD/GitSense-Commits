# Activity Summary for 26/11/2025

## 11:03:11
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`**: This file contains utility functions `makeAPICall` and `logUserEvent`.
    *   **`makeAPICall` function**: This function handles API requests using Axios, incorporating features such as:
        *   Security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`).
        *   Conditional `withCredentials` based on `skipCookies`.
        *   Loader management (`loaderEvent`).
        *   Special handling for internal users, preventing non-GET operations on specific URLs.
        *   Support for single and multiple file uploads with custom field names.
        *   Robust error handling, particularly for 401 Unauthorized responses, which clears `localStorage` tokens and redirects users to the login page, while preserving the original URL if necessary.
    *   **`logUserEvent` function**: This function is designed to log user interaction events. It includes logic to:
        *   Gather user data (email, name, role) and merchant data (ID, name).
        *   Generate a unique `userSessionId` using `nanoid` and store it in a cookie if one doesn't exist.
        *   Determine the `landing_page` from the `window.location.pathname`.
        *   Parse the `userAgentString` to extract details about the operating system, device, OS version, browser, browser version, and detect if it's a webview (`is_wv`).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

All changes occurred on **22/11/2025** within a short span of time, focusing on the error handling within the `makeAPICall` function's `catch` block.

*   **17:38:55**: The initial state of the `catch` block for 401 errors in `makeAPICall` returned `{ ...error, error: true }`.
*   **17:39:07**: This timestamp marks a modification to the 401 error handling. The return statement was updated to explicitly provide an error message: `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This aimed to give more user-friendly or specific error feedback.
*   **17:39:40**: The code was reverted to its state at 17:38:55. The `catch` block for 401 errors once again returned `{ ...error, error: true }`, undoing the change made moments before.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration/Reversion**: The timestamps indicate a very quick change and subsequent reversion of the error handling logic, suggesting either testing, a temporary bug fix, or a change of mind regarding the desired error structure for 401 responses.
*   **Comprehensive Utility Design**: The `common.ts` file acts as a central place for critical dashboard functionalities, handling both network communication (`makeAPICall`) and analytics/tracking (`logUserEvent`).
*   **Security Best Practices**: The `makeAPICall` function includes several standard security headers, demonstrating an emphasis on protecting against common web vulnerabilities.
*   **User/Merchant Context**: Both functions extensively leverage `dashboardStore` to access `userData` and `merchantData`, ensuring that API calls and event logs are made within the appropriate user and merchant context.
*   **Cookie Management**: The use of `getCookie` and `setCookie` for `userSessionId` indicates reliance on client-side cookies for session tracking.

## 11:52:58
The log captures changes across a dashboard application, primarily focusing on frontend configuration and shipping/discount validation logic.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:17:41**: The initial state of this EJS template defines the application's base HTML, CSP, and `systemjs-importmap` configurations. It includes conditional imports for `@gokwik` modules based on `isLocal`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, and `production` environments, with production including New Relic and Microsoft Clarity tracking. The `isLocal` environment initially points `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:50:58**: The `isLocal` environment configuration was updated, changing the source for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` from `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` to `dev-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:52:06**: Further adjustments were made to the `isLocal` environment, directing `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` to `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:53:39**: The `isLocal` environment's `systemjs-importmap` for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` was reverted to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`, effectively returning to its initial `sandbox` configuration.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:31:55**: This React component is introduced, designed for configuring shipping methods. It contains form fields for shipping name, price, min/max order values, and advanced conditions. It includes functionality for uploading/downloading CSVs (e.g., pincodes) and API calls for customer segments and presigned URLs for file uploads.
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:36:01**: No functional code changes were observed in this update.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:45:40**: This file defines various validation functions (`validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, `validateBuyXatYDiscount`, `validateDiscountCapping`, `validateGWP`) used across the application. These functions enforce rules like unique codes, valid ranges (e.g., upper limit > lower limit), and preventing range overlaps for different discount and shipping tiers.
    *   **Subsequent timestamps (24/11/2025, 12:47:57 to 24/11/2025, 17:34:51)**: No functional code changes were observed across multiple updates, suggesting repeated saving, minor formatting changes, or reversion of test modifications. The core validation logic remained consistent.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:16:01**: This React component, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, is added to handle weight-based shipping configurations. It features a form for defining shipping name, ID, min/max weight, and price, along with a table for managing existing rates. It uses `validateWeightRangeDifference` for form validation.
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:23:28**: No functional code changes were observed in this update.
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:27:43**: The `validateWeightRangeDifference` function call within `getValesFromForm` was modified to pass an additional boolean argument (`isEditEnabled` or `false`), providing context for add vs. edit operations.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:40:20**: A `console.log(weightConfig)` statement was removed from the `if (isEditEnabled)` block in `getValesFromForm`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:49:44**: The `if (isEditEnabled)` block in `getValesFromForm` was further refined to filter existing shipping rates before re-validating the updated configuration.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:07:59**: The `validateWeightRangeDifference` call for adding new entries was changed to explicitly pass `weightConfig.weight_based_shipping_rates` instead of the entire `weightConfig` object.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:20:50**: The validation logic for new entries was temporarily refactored to call `validateWeightRangeDifference` twice (once for `min_weight`, once for `max_weight` with fewer arguments), and error message handling was updated.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:24:39**: The validation logic for new entries was reverted or corrected, returning to a single `validateWeightRangeDifference` call with 4 arguments.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:15:07**: A `console.log(weightConfigs, "===")` was added to the `useEffect` hook.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:19:27**: The `useEffect` hook's `setWeightConfig` logic was updated to conditionally use `weightConfigs` only if it has elements, preventing overwriting with an empty array. The debug `console.log` was slightly adjusted.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:19:36**: The `console.log` statement was removed from the `useEffect` hook.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:17:43**: This `ShippingService` component is introduced, acting as a container for different shipping configuration tabs: "Shipping Method", "Weight Based Shipping", and "Discount Based Shipping". It conditionally renders a `ShippingMethodConfig` if no shipping prices are present.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:29:59**: A new tab, "Product Based Shipping", was added (key '2'), conditionally rendered based on `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service`. This shifted the keys for "Weight Based Shipping" to '3' and "Discount Based Shipping" to '4', with corresponding updates in the `handleTabChange` function.
    *   **25/11/2025, 13:00:14**: A minor formatting change was made to the `Tabs` component's props order (`destroyInactiveTabPane` reordered).

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
    *   **25/11/2025, 12:58:37**: This `ProductSearch` React component is added, enabling search and selection of products or collections. It includes features like debounced search, infinite scrolling, managing quantities for selected items, "top-up gift" pricing, and agent-led product filtering.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **25/11/2025, 12:59:31**: This file is introduced, centralizing numerous API endpoints related to orders, customers, shipping, taxes, analytics, discounts, Shopify integrations, and merchant configurations.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **25/11/2025, 12:59:47**: This file provides utility functions for abstracting API calls, including `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` (which handles pagination, active status filtering, and data transformation), `updateMerchantData`, `validateGstData`, and `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Timestamping:** All changes are precisely timestamped (`DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS`).
*   **Environment Configuration Focus:** The `index.ejs` and `.env` files show frequent modifications related to switching or defining environment-specific URLs (e.g., `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`) for various `@gokwik` modules and API endpoints. This suggests active development, testing, and deployment to different environments.
*   **Shipping and Discount Feature Development:** A significant portion of changes is concentrated in the `checkout-dashboard-ui` module, specifically around shipping settings (`shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `weightShipping.tsx`, `shippingBasedService.tsx`) and general validation (`validations.ts`). This indicates ongoing development and refinement of these core features.
*   **Validation Logic Refinements:** The `validations.ts` file, while appearing mostly static in content, is frequently saved. This, combined with targeted adjustments in `weightShipping.tsx` to how validation functions are called (`validateWeightRangeDifference`), suggests continuous iteration on input validation rules and mechanisms.
*   **Component-Based Architecture:** The presence of multiple `.tsx` files (React components) managing specific UI/feature areas (e.g., `ShippingMethodConfig`, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, `ProductSearch`, `ShippingService`) points to a component-driven or micro-frontend development approach.
*   **API Centralization:** The `apiEndpoints.ts` file acts as a central repository for all backend API routes, which is then consumed by API utility functions in `api.ts`.
*   **Gokwik Ecosystem:** The code consistently refers to "Gokwik" components, UI kits, and API domains, indicating development within a larger "Gokwik" platform.
*   **Debugging and Cleanup:** The insertion and removal of `console.log` statements in `weightShipping.tsx` indicates active debugging during development.

## 12:03:09
For the file `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`, the log shows a series of rapid updates on 22/11/2025, specifically regarding error handling in the `makeAPICall` function.

At 17:38:55, the `makeAPICall` function's `catch (error)` block for a `401` status code was configured to return the entire error object along with an `error: true` flag: `return { ...error, error: true }`.

A significant change occurred at 17:39:07. The `401` error handling in `makeAPICall` was modified to explicitly return an `error: true` flag and a `message` derived from the error response data, falling back to the generic error message if specific data isn't available: `return { error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This indicates an intention to provide a more specific error message to the caller.

However, shortly after, at 17:39:40, this specific change was reverted. The code for the `401` error handling in `makeAPICall` returned to its initial state from 17:38:55, once again returning the full error object: `return { ...error, error: true }`.

Across all these entries, the `APIRequestConfig` interface, the `internalUserPostUrls` array, and the overall structure and logic of `makeAPICall` (except for the mentioned `401` error return) remain consistent. A recurring element observed is that the `parseUserAgent` function within `logUserEvent` is consistently truncated at the end across all provided log entries.

## 13:03:14
In `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`, the `makeAPICall` function, responsible for handling Axios-based API requests, underwent a modification and subsequent reversion within a short timeframe.

**Key Changes:**

*   **Initial State (22/11/2025, 17:38:55):** The `makeAPICall` function was established to handle secure API interactions. This included enforcing restrictions for internal users on non-GET requests, setting robust security headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`), managing file uploads (both single and multiple), controlling UI loaders, and specifically handling 401 Unauthorized errors by clearing the local storage token and redirecting to the login page under certain conditions. Upon a 401 error, it returned a generic error object: `{ ...error, error: true }`.
*   **Intermediate Update (22/11/2025, 17:39:07):** A specific change was introduced to the error handling within the `makeAPICall` function. For 401 Unauthorized responses, the function was updated to return a more structured error object, explicitly extracting the message from the response: `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This aimed to provide clearer error feedback.
*   **Reversion (22/11/2025, 17:39:40):** Shortly after the intermediate update, the change was reverted. The `makeAPICall` function's 401 error handling mechanism was restored to its original state, once again returning the full error object: `{ ...error, error: true }`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

The file `common.ts` primarily focuses on two asynchronous functions: `makeAPICall` for network requests and `logUserEvent` for user activity logging. The changes specifically impacted the `makeAPICall` function's error response structure during a 401 Unauthorized scenario. The `logUserEvent` function, which prepares user event data including a user agent parser, remained unchanged (and appears incomplete/truncated in all log entries).

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:07:** Introduction of a more specific error message structure for 401 API errors.
*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:40:** Reversion of the error message structure for 401 API errors back to the initial, more generic format.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The recurring pattern observed is the instability or immediate reconsideration of the error handling strategy within the `makeAPICall` function for 401 Unauthorized responses. This suggests an ongoing refinement or debate over how errors should be presented and handled at the API utility layer. The repeated nature of the `logUserEvent` function's truncated state also implies that part of the code might be a work in progress or not fully logged.

## 14:03:15
The provided log details changes to a single file, `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`, across three timestamps on 22/11/2025.

**File-specific Updates and Timestamps:**

*   **22/11/2025, 17:38:55:** This entry establishes the initial state of the `common.ts` file. It includes:
    *   An `APIRequestConfig` interface for defining API call parameters.
    *   A `makeAPICall` asynchronous function that acts as an Axios wrapper. This function handles various concerns such as:
        *   Restricting non-GET operations for "internal users" on specific predefined URLs.
        *   Configuring Axios instances with a base URL from `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and setting several security-related HTTP headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` for non-development environments).
        *   Managing loading states via `loaderEvent`.
        *   Appending a `mode` parameter to requests based on user data.
        *   Supporting both single and multiple file uploads using `FormData`.
        *   Implementing comprehensive error handling, specifically for `401 Unauthorized` responses, which triggers a redirection to the `/login` page after clearing the local storage token, while skipping redirection for certain paths.
        *   Resetting a timer via `timerEvent(null)` upon successful completion.
    *   An `EventsInterface` for logging user events.
    *   A `logUserEvent` asynchronous function containing helper functions like `getFixedParams` (to gather common event parameters such as `tracking_id`, `request_id` derived from email, a session ID generated with `nanoid` and stored in a cookie, and merchant/user details) and an incomplete `parseUserAgent` function for extracting browser and OS information.

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:07:** A minor but significant change was introduced in the `makeAPICall` function. Within the `catch` block, specifically for `401 Unauthorized` errors, the return statement was modified from `return { ...error, error: true }` to `return { error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This update aimed to provide a more structured error response, explicitly including an `error` flag and a user-friendly `message` from the API response or the general error.

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:40:** This entry shows a reversion to the code state found at 17:38:55. The change made at 17:39:07 to the 401 error handling was removed, and the `makeAPICall` function reverted to returning the spread `error` object (`{ ...error, error: true }`) for `401` status codes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Rapid Iteration:** The three timestamps are very close together (within 45 seconds), indicating rapid saving or minor adjustments during development.
*   **Consistent Core Logic:** Despite a brief alteration, the core functionality of `makeAPICall` and `logUserEvent` remains largely unchanged across all entries. This suggests that the primary purpose and structure of these utility functions are stable.
*   **Incomplete Function:** The `parseUserAgent` function within `logUserEvent` is consistently truncated at the end of the file in all logs, suggesting it was either under development or part of a larger change not fully captured.
*   **Security Focus:** The `makeAPICall` function consistently implements various security headers and includes logic for `withCredentials`, indicating a strong emphasis on securing API communications.
*   **User Experience (UX) Enhancements:** The presence of `loaderEvent` for visual feedback during API calls and the detailed `logUserEvent` for tracking user interactions highlights a focus on both UX and analytics.

## 14:59:16
No summarizable code changes were found as all provided log entries correspond to `.env` files, which are excluded from the summary per instructions.

## 15:03:15
The file `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts` primarily contains utility functions for making API calls and logging user events within a dashboard application.

**File-Specific Updates:**
The core functionality of the `common.ts` file involves:

*   **`makeAPICall` function:** This asynchronous function handles various API interactions using Axios. It includes:
    *   An `APIRequestConfig` interface to define flexible API request parameters, including support for single and multiple file uploads.
    *   Security measures, such as preventing internal users from performing disallowed non-GET operations and setting various HTTP security headers (`X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` in production).
    *   Integration with a `loaderEvent` for managing loading states and `timerEvent` for timeouts.
    *   Conditional inclusion of a `mode` parameter for non-internal users.
    *   Comprehensive error handling, specifically for `401 Unauthorized` responses, which clears the user token, stores the current path for redirection, and navigates to the `/login` page, while carefully whitelisting certain paths to avoid premature redirects.
*   **`logUserEvent` function:** This function is designed to log user interaction events. It gathers extensive user and session details, including:
    *   `tracking_id` and `userSessionId` (generated with `nanoid` and stored in cookies if not present).
    *   User-specific information like email, merchant ID, merchant name, username, and role.
    *   Timestamp and landing page information.
*   **`parseUserAgent` function:** This utility within `logUserEvent` is responsible for parsing the `navigator.userAgent` string to extract details about the user's operating system, device, OS version, browser, browser version, and whether it's a webview.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:07:** A specific change was introduced in the `makeAPICall` function's error handling for `401 Unauthorized` responses. The return object for this error was modified from spreading the original error object (`{ ...error, error: true }`) to providing a more structured response with a specific message (`{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`).
*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:40:** The change made at 17:39:07 was reverted. The `makeAPICall` function's `401 Unauthorized` error handling returned to its previous state of spreading the error object and adding `error: true`.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements in the Content:**

*   **Consistent Structure:** The overall structure and imports of the `common.ts` file, including the `APIRequestConfig` interface, `internalUserPostUrls` array, and the main logic within `makeAPICall` and `logUserEvent` (excluding the specific error message change), remained consistent across all log entries.
*   **Incomplete Code Snippets:** The provided log entries consistently cut off the `logUserEvent` and `parseUserAgent` functions at the exact same point. This indicates that the latter parts of these functions were not included in the log or did not undergo changes within this specific timeframe.
*   **Focus on API Interaction and User Event Logging:** The file demonstrates a clear pattern of encapsulating common functionalities related to network requests (with loaders, security, and error handling) and user activity tracking.
*   **Environmental Variable Usage:** The `makeAPICall` function consistently uses `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and checks `process.env.NODE_ENV` for environment-specific configurations, indicating a standard practice for handling different deployment environments.

## 15:59:15
The provided log only contains changes to a `.env` file. As per the instructions, changes to files containing "env" or anything that may store keys will not be summarized. Therefore, no relevant changes are available for summarization.

## 16:03:11
The log details changes to a single file: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates for `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`:**

The modifications are confined to the `makeAPICall` asynchronous function, specifically within its `catch (error)` block when handling a `401 Unauthorized` HTTP status code.

*   **Initial State (22/11/2025, 17:38:55):** The error handling for a `401` status code returned a generic error object: `return { ...error, error: true }`.
*   **First Change (22/11/2025, 17:39:07):** The return statement for `401` errors was updated to provide a more specific message: `return { error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This change aimed to extract the error message from the API response or fall back to the generic error message.
*   **Second Change (22/11/2025, 17:39:40):** The previous modification was reverted. The code was changed back to its initial state, returning the generic error object: `return { ...error, error: true }`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:07:** A specific change was introduced to enhance error message reporting for 401 responses.
*   **22/11/2025, 17:39:40:** The change introduced just seconds earlier was reverted.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The changes show a rapid, contained modification and subsequent reversion within a very short timeframe (45 seconds between the first and last log entry). This suggests an attempted change or fix to the `makeAPICall` function's error handling for 401 status codes that was quickly undone. The rest of the file, including the `APIRequestConfig` interface, `internalUserPostUrls` array, the file upload logic, and the `logUserEvent` function with its `getFixedParams` and `parseUserAgent` helpers, remained consistent across all logged entries.

## 16:50:57
The provided logs primarily showcase changes across two key areas in the `checkout-dashboard-ui` repository: shipping settings components and validation helpers, along with updates to environment configurations and the main `index.ejs` file.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`** (Timestamp: 24/11/2025, 12:36:01):
    *   This file, representing a React component for configuring shipping methods, received a significant update.
    *   It now includes functionality for uploading and downloading CSV files related to cohorts, leveraging AWS S3 presigned URLs.
    *   New state variables were introduced for managing UI elements like `isSwitchEnabled`, `isModalVisible`, `currentFile` (for pincodes and cohorts), and `saveButtonVisibility`.
    *   API calls for `getCohortPresignedUrl` and `downloadCohortCSV` were added, indicating an expansion of cohort management features.
    *   Form fields for "Shipping Name", "Shipping Price", "Min Order Value", and "Max Order Value" were defined, including validation rules (e.g., uniqueness for shipping names, positive numbers for prices/values).
    *   An "Advanced Conditions" button and an "Add Shipping" button were added to the form.
    *   Pincode uploading functionality was partially implemented, allowing CSV file uploads and including logic for validation (checking for 6-digit numeric pincodes).

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`** (Multiple timestamps: 24/11/2025 from 12:45:40 to 17:34:51, and 25/11/2025 at 12:59:31, 26/11/2025 at 12:35:45):
    *   This file contains validation logic for various discount types (`TieredDiscount`, `DynamicDiscount`, `BuyXAtYDiscount`, `DiscountCapping`, `GWP`).
    *   The primary change observed across numerous timestamps is the addition of a new validation function `validateWeightRangeDifference`. This function is intended to validate weight ranges, likely for a weight-based shipping configuration. The specific implementation of this function is not fully visible in the provided snippets but its presence is indicated by imports and calls in `weightShipping.tsx`.
    *   The repeated identical content in this file suggests frequent saves or commits without functional changes, possibly due to whitespace changes or automated formatting.
    *   Imports were updated to include `Weight_based_Shipping_Rates` from `../interface`, indicating the introduction of weight-based shipping concepts.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx`** (Multiple timestamps: 24/11/2025 from 15:16:01 to 20:19:36):
    *   This component, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, was significantly expanded and refined. It handles the configuration of shipping rates based on weight.
    *   It imports `validateWeightRangeDifference` from the `validations` helper, confirming its integration.
    *   State variables like `weightConfig`, `isEditEnabled`, `prevFormState`, `saveButtonVisibility`, and `selectedFilters` are crucial for managing the UI and data.
    *   Form fields for "Shipping Name", "Shipping ID", "Min Weight", "Max Weight", and "Shipping Price" are defined with comprehensive validation rules (e.g., uniqueness for name, positive numbers for weights/prices, "Max value should be greater than min value").
    *   A `Table` component is used to display configured weight-based shipping methods, with columns for 'Shipping ID', 'Weight Based Shipping Name', 'Price', 'Min Weight', 'Max Weight', and 'Action' (Edit/Delete).
    *   Filtering options for 'Shipping ID' are dynamically generated based on existing configurations.
    *   `useEffect` hooks manage the `weightConfig` state based on `weightConfigs` props and initialize `selectedFilters`.
    *   The `getValesFromForm` function encapsulates the form submission logic, including validation checks for name uniqueness and weight range overlaps using `validateWeightRangeDifference`. The parameter signature of `validateWeightRangeDifference` changed over time to `(weightConfig, min_weight, max_weight, shipping_uuid, isEditEnabled)`.
    *   The `weightConfigs` prop in `useEffect` initially didn't check for length before updating, which was later corrected to `weightConfigs?.length ? weightConfigs : weightConfig.weight_based_shipping_rates` to prevent overwriting existing state with an empty array.

4.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`** (Timestamps: 24/11/2025, 20:17:43; 24/11/2025, 20:29:59; 25/11/2025, 13:00:14; 26/11/2025, 12:35:55):
    *   This component serves as the main entry point for shipping services configuration, using `Tabs` to switch between different shipping methods.
    *   Initially, it had three tabs: 'Shipping Method', 'Weight Based Shipping', and 'Discount Based Shipping'.
    *   A new tab, 'Product Based Shipping', and its corresponding component `ProductBasedShipping` were introduced and conditionally rendered based on `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service`.
    *   The `handleTabChange` logic was updated to account for the new tab, shifting the `refetchWeight` and `refetchDiscount` calls to keys '3' and '4' respectively.
    *   The `destroyInactiveTabPane` prop was added to the `Tabs` component.
    *   The `filterKeyData` prop is passed to `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, allowing for pre-filtering of the table based on the active tab's data.

5.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`** (Timestamp: 25/11/2025, 12:58:37):
    *   This file introduces a `ProductSearch` component for searching and managing products or collections, commonly used in discount configurations.
    *   It supports searching by `products` or `collections`, with options to hide search inputs or buttons.
    *   Features include pagination (`useIntersectionObserver` for infinite scrolling), debounced search, handling of variant-level product data, and specific logic for agent-led scenarios (filtering items with 'no-agent' tags).
    *   It allows for adding/removing items, adjusting quantities (for products or collections), and setting offered prices for "top-up gifts".
    *   Includes validation for collection quantities against a `collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity`.

6.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`** (Timestamp: 25/11/2025, 12:59:31; 26/11/2025, 12:35:45):
    *   The API endpoints file was updated to include new endpoints for "upsellCheckout" related operations: `getandDeleteUpsellData` and `updateUpsellData`.
    *   A new endpoint `getProductById` was also added.

7.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`** (Timestamp: 25/11/2025, 12:59:47; 26/11/2025, 12:35:28):
    *   This file includes utility functions for making API calls.
    *   It was updated to incorporate new functions `getAndDeleteUpsellData` and `pushUpsellData`, which interact with the newly defined upsell endpoints.
    *   The `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` function's logic was slightly refined to handle `title` and `page/pageSize` parameters for searching products and collections, including filtering for 'active' products and mapping variants.

8.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`** (Timestamps: 24/11/2025, 16:50:58; 24/11/2025, 16:52:06; 24/11/2025, 16:53:39):
    *   These changes involve updates to the `systemjs-importmap` configuration for various `@gokwik` modules, particularly in the `isLocal`, `dev`, `qa`, and `sandbox` environments.
    *   The base URLs for modules like `@gokwik/utilities`, `@gokwik/dashboard`, `@gokwik/payment`, `@gokwik/kwikpass`, `@gokwik/rto`, `@gokwik/kwikship`, `@gokwik/ellora`, `@gokwik/checkout-platform`, and `@gokwik/shopify-app` were modified across different deployment environments.
    *   Specifically, in `isLocal` environment, the base URL for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` changed from `https://dev-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` and then to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` over the logs.
    *   The local development URL for `@gokwik/checkout` remained `//localhost:9002/gokwik-checkout.js`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **24/11/2025, 12:36:01**: Major update to `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` with cohort and pincode upload/download functionalities and new form validations.
*   **24/11/2025, 15:16:01 - 24/11/2025, 20:19:36**: Iterative development on `weightShipping.tsx`, introducing form fields, table display, and integrating `validateWeightRangeDifference`. Refinements in handling `weightConfigs` and `filterKeyData`.
*   **24/11/2025, 12:45:40 - 24/11/2025, 17:34:51**: Consistent (though often identical content) updates to `validations.ts`, indicating the addition and refinement of the `validateWeightRangeDifference` function.
*   **24/11/2025, 20:29:59**: Introduction of 'Product Based Shipping' tab in `shippingBasedService.tsx`.
*   **25/11/2025, 12:58:37**: New `ProductSearch` component introduced for general product/collection searching in discount scenarios.
*   **26/11/2025, 12:35:28 - 26/11/2025, 12:35:45**: Addition of "upsellCheckout" endpoints and related API functions in `apiEndpoints.ts` and `api.ts`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Shipping Configuration Focus**: A significant portion of the changes revolves around enhancing shipping configuration, specifically adding weight-based and potentially product-based shipping methods, alongside existing basic shipping methods.
*   **Form Management and Validation**: Both `shippingBasedMethods.tsx` and `weightShipping.tsx` heavily utilize `gokwik-ui-kit`'s `Form` component, defining `fields` arrays with names, labels, input props, and validation `rules`. This pattern emphasizes structured form handling and client-side validation.
*   **State Management**: `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are extensively used in React components (`shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `weightShipping.tsx`, `productSearch.tsx`) for managing UI state (e.g., modal visibility, edit modes, current files, filters) and side effects. `useMemo` is used for optimizing computed values like `uniqueShippingUUIDs` and `filterOptions`.
*   **API Interactions**: Components frequently interact with a backend API using `makeAPICall` (from `@gokwik/utilities`) and `APIEndPoints` for fetching and saving configuration data, uploading files, and other operations. The `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` prefix is consistently used for API calls.
*   **Environment Configuration**: The `.env` file consistently defines `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_BULK_DISCOUNT_URL` with different values for `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, and `prod` environments, though only one is active at a time in the provided snippets. The `index.ejs` file also reflects environment-specific import maps for loading various `@gokwik` micro-frontend modules.
*   **Modularization**: The codebase uses a modular approach, with separate components for different functionalities (e.g., `ShippingMethodConfig`, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, `DiscountBaseShipping`, `ProductBasedShipping`) and helper files for utilities and validations.
*   **Error Handling/Messaging**: `message.error()` from `gokwik-ui-kit` is commonly used to display user-friendly error messages during form validation or API call failures.
*   **UI Kit Usage**: The project heavily relies on `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI components (Button, Card, Col, Form, Input, Select, Table, Tooltip, etc.), promoting a consistent look and feel.
*   **`validations.ts` Repetition**: The `validations.ts` file appears many times with identical content. This suggests that the changes within this file might be minor (e.g., whitespace, comments, or very small logic tweaks that don't alter the overall structure shown) or that the log includes many saves where no actual functional code change occurred in the snippet provided. The repeated inclusion of `Weight_based_Shipping_Rates` in imports confirms the consistent intent to support weight-based shipping validations.

## 16:59:26
The log details changes across an Appmaker SDK project, primarily focusing on dependency management and initialization.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/src/initApp.js`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 26/11/2025, 16:00:52
    *   **Key Update:** This file explicitly imports core Appmaker components and a specific extension: `@appmaker-xyz/plugins`, `@appmaker-xyz/shopify-core-theme`, and `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwik-pass-v2`. It also includes commented-out lines indicating the general structure for importing other Appmaker packages or partner extensions. This suggests the file is responsible for initializing the application with necessary plugins and extensions.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/package.json`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 26/11/2025, 16:16:43
    *   **Key Update:** This is a comprehensive `package.json` for an `@appmaker-xyz/appmaker-sdk` project, version `3.0.0`.
        *   **Scripts:** Defines standard development scripts like `start`, `android`, `ios`, and a `gql:codegen` script specifically for Shopify's extended GraphQL.
        *   **Dependencies:** Contains a vast array of packages, with a strong emphasis on the `@appmaker-xyz` ecosystem (e.g., `app-config`, `core`, `plugins`, `shopify`, `shopify-core-theme`). Many `@appmaker-xyz` package versions are tied to `expo-v2-53-starter-app`, indicating a dependency on Expo SDK 53. Other notable dependencies include numerous `@react-native-firebase` packages for analytics, authentication, messaging, etc., various React Native modules, Expo 53 itself, and `@shopify/checkout-sheet-kit`. It uses React 19.0.0 and React Native 0.79.5.
        *   **DevDependencies:** Lists development tools like `@babel/core`, `typescript`, `lerna`, and `expo-module-scripts`.
        *   **Publish Configuration:** Specifies custom registries (`https://flash.appmaker.xyz`) for publishing.
        *   **Workspaces:** Configured for a monorepo setup, managing `packages/*` and `packages-dev/*`.
        *   **Package Manager:** Enforces `yarn@1.22.22`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Appmaker SDK Focus:** The dominant pattern is the strong integration with the `@appmaker-xyz` ecosystem, evident from the project name, numerous dependencies prefixed with `@appmaker-xyz`, and specific package versions referencing `expo-v2-53-starter-app`.
*   **Expo 53 Alignment:** There's a clear intent to support Expo SDK 53, as indicated by the `expo` dependency version (`^53.0.0`) and the `expo-v2-53-starter-app` suffix in many `@appmaker-xyz` package versions.
*   **Shopify Integration:** The presence of `@appmaker-xyz/shopify`, `@appmaker-xyz/shopify-core-theme`, `@shopify/checkout-sheet-kit`, and a Shopify-related GraphQL codegen script highlights deep integration with the Shopify e-commerce platform.
*   **Firebase Services:** A comprehensive suite of `@react-native-firebase` dependencies suggests extensive use of Firebase for backend services, analytics, and messaging within the application.
*   **Monorepo Structure:** The `workspaces` configuration in `package.json` indicates that this project is part of a larger monorepo, suggesting a modular and potentially multi-package development approach.

## 17:03:13
File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`

This file, responsible for common utility functions related to API calls and user event logging, underwent several quick modifications concerning its `makeAPICall` function's error handling.

**Changes at 22/11/2025:**

*   **17:38:55:** The `makeAPICall` function, which handles all API interactions including file uploads, loader events, and authentication (e.g., preventing internal users from non-GET operations and redirecting on 401 errors), initially returned an unauthorized error by spreading the entire error object and adding `error: true`.
*   **17:39:07:** A modification was introduced to refine the error return for a `401 Unauthorized` status. Instead of spreading the entire error object, it explicitly returned `error: true` along with a `message` property, preferring `error?.response?.data?.message` if available, or falling back to `error.message`. This aimed to provide a more structured and user-friendly error message.
*   **17:39:40:** The change made at 17:39:07 was reverted. The function returned to its original behavior, where it spreads the entire error object when an unauthorized (401) API response is received.

**Patterns/Recurring Elements:**

The changes observed within a short timeframe (within a minute) indicate a focused effort on adjusting the way unauthorized API errors are structured and returned by the `makeAPICall` function. The rapid succession of a change and its subsequent revert suggests an immediate review, testing, or a decision to roll back a specific error handling approach. The `makeAPICall` function consistently manages a wide array of features, including setting request headers, handling loader events, managing user authentication contexts (internal user roles, `merchant-mid`), and differentiating between standard API calls and file uploads. The `logUserEvent` function and its related user agent parsing utilities remained unchanged across all logs.

## 17:52:06
The log details changes across three primary files in a `checkout-dashboard-ui` project: `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, `validations.ts`, and `weightShipping.tsx`, with a few updates also to `apiEndpoints.ts` and `dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 24/11/2025, 12:36:01**
    *   This file, a React component named `ShippingMethodConfig`, handles the configuration of shipping methods based on price.
    *   It imports numerous UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and utilities for API calls (`makeAPICall`, `makeAWSPutCall`, `downloadFromURL`, `downloadToCSV`, `uploadCohortCsv`).
    *   It manages state for switch toggles (code_fee, shipping_tag, edd_tag), modals, form state, selected customer segments, shipping configurations, and file uploads (pincodes, cohorts).
    *   Key functionalities include fetching customer segments, requesting and uploading CSV files for cohorts, and fetching pincode lists for shipping.
    *   The component defines form fields for "Shipping Name", "Shipping Price", "Min Order Value", and "Max Order Value", along with validation rules for uniqueness and numeric inputs.
    *   It also includes an `UploadProps` configuration for CSV file uploads, specifically for pincodes, with client-side validation for file format and content (6-digit pincode regex).

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps: 24/11/2025 (multiple entries from 12:45:40 to 17:34:51)**
    *   This file contains a collection of validation functions for various discount and shipping configurations. The content remains largely consistent across all listed timestamps, indicating no functional changes were made, but rather the file was repeatedly saved or automatically formatted.
    *   It defines a `rangesOverlap` utility function to check for overlaps between two numerical ranges.
    *   Exported validation functions include:
        *   `validateTieredDiscount`: Validates tiered discounts, checking for missing payment method, unique discount codes, valid lower/upper limits, overlapping tiers, and required values for "freebie" or "non-freebie" discount types. It specifically checks for different freebie products within common ranges.
        *   `validateDynamicDiscount`: Validates dynamic discounts, checking for valid discount names, consistency in discount categories, selected discount types, and valid discount values/percentages. It also includes logic for "volume" and "value" based discount categories, including checks for duplicate item volumes and overlapping order value tiers.
        *   `validateBuyXatYDiscount`: Validates "Buy X at Y" discounts, checking for valid names, match types, product quantities, capped values, and similar existing discounts.
        *   `validateDiscountCapping`: Validates discount capping, ensuring a match type, code/regex, and capping limit are provided.
        *   `validateGWP`: Validates "Gift With Purchase" discounts, checking for eligibility rule match type, discount code, and uniqueness of the discount code.
    *   The consistent content across multiple timestamps suggests this file was frequently touched, possibly during development and testing of features relying on these validations.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamps: 24/11/2025 (multiple entries from 15:16:01 to 20:19:36)**
    *   This React component, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, handles shipping configurations based on weight.
    *   It imports UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit`, `formatAmount` helper, `ShippingRangeChecker`, `RenderField`, and `validateWeightRangeDifference` from the `validations.ts` file.
    *   State variables manage form visibility (`open`), edit mode (`isEditEnabled`), weight configuration (`weightConfig`), previous form state (`prevFormState`), button visibility (`button`, `saveButtonVisibility`), modal visibility (`isModalVisible`), and selected filters for the table (`selectedFilters`).
    *   `useEffect` hooks update `weightConfig` when `weightConfigs` change and `selectedFilters` when `filterKeyData` changes.
    *   `useMemo` hooks are used to create `uniqueShippingUUIDs` and `filterOptions` for the table headers, optimizing re-renders.
    *   Form fields for "Shipping Name", "Shipping ID", "Min Weight", "Max Weight", and "Shipping Price" are defined with validation rules (e.g., unique name, valid positive numbers, price > 0, max weight > min weight).
    *   The `getValesFromForm` function processes form submission, performing validations like ensuring unique shipping names and checking for overlapping weight ranges using `validateWeightRangeDifference`.
    *   **Significant changes:**
        *   **24/11/2025, 15:23:28:** The `validateWeightRangeDifference` function call within `getValesFromForm` was updated to pass `isEditEnabled` as an argument when adding a new shipping method.
        *   **24/11/2025, 15:27:43, 15:35:11, 16:30:14:** The `isEditEnabled` argument to `validateWeightRangeDifference` was changed to `false` for new shipping method additions, indicating a consistent behavior for adding new entries.
        *   **24/11/2025, 17:20:50:** The `validateWeightRangeDifference` function was split into two calls, `minValidate` and `maxValidate`, with separate error messages for min and max weight ranges. The `weightConfig` object was passed directly to the validation function. This suggests a refinement in how weight range overlaps are validated, providing more specific feedback.
        *   **24/11/2025, 17:36:11:** The `validateWeightRangeDifference` parameters were updated, removing `isEditEnabled` from the parameters for new entry validation, and adapting the edit logic to filter `weightConfig` when updating an existing record.
        *   **24/11/2025, 20:15:07:** A `console.log(weightConfigs, "===")` was added in the `useEffect` hook, likely for debugging purposes.
        *   **24/11/2025, 20:19:27, 20:19:36:** The `setWeightConfig` logic in the `useEffect` was updated to conditionally use `weightConfigs` if it has length, otherwise falling back to the existing `weightConfig.weight_based_shipping_rates`. This handles cases where `weightConfigs` might be empty initially.

4.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 25/11/2025, 12:59:31**
    *   This file, defining API endpoints, received several new entries related to upsell features: `upsellCheckout.getandDeleteUpsellData` and `upsellCheckout.updateUpsellData`.
    *   A `getProductById` endpoint was also added.

5.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp: 25/11/2025, 12:59:47**
    *   This file introduces new API functions: `getAndDeleteUpsellData` for fetching or deleting upsell data, and `pushUpsellData` for updating upsell rules. These functions utilize the newly added upsell endpoints from `apiEndpoints.ts`.
    *   **Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 12:35:28**
    *   Further refined `getAndDeleteUpsellData` and `pushUpsellData` functions, including error handling. An import for `ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage` was added, though its direct use in the provided snippet is not visible.

6.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 24/11/2025, 20:29:59**
    *   This React component, `ShippingService`, was updated to introduce a new tab: "Product Based Shipping".
    *   The `tabsList` array now conditionally includes this new tab based on `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service`.
    *   The `handleTabChange` function was updated to trigger `refetchWeight` when switching to tab '3' (Weight Based Shipping) and `refetchDiscount` for tab '4' (Discount Based Shipping), indicating a reordering of tabs or addition of new tab '2'.
    *   **Timestamp: 25/11/2025, 13:00:14**
    *   The `<Tabs>` component now includes `destroyInactiveTabPane`, which unmounts inactive tab contents to optimize performance.

7.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp: 25/11/2025, 12:58:37**
    *   This React component, `ProductSearch`, provides a UI for searching and selecting products or collections.
    *   It imports `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` and utilizes `useIntersectionObserver` for infinite scrolling.
    *   New props like `collateProducts`, `alloweditemscount`, `hideSearchInput`, `isAgentLed`, `collectionSpecificData`, and `topUpGift` were added, expanding its configurability.
    *   The component manages state for loading, search text, modal visibility, search results, and pagination.
    *   It includes a `parseResponse` function that handles mapping and collating products/variants or collections from API responses.
    *   `useEffect` hooks handle debounced search input, modal closing logic, and infinite scrolling (`lastElementVisible`).
    *   New features include:
        *   Quantity input for gifts (`topUpGift`).
        *   Conditional display of a new "Product Based Shipping" tab.
        *   Collection-specific quantity management, including validation against a `collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Timestamp Pattern:** All changes occurred on `24/11/2025` and `25/11/2025`, with frequent saves/minor modifications, especially in `validations.ts` and `weightShipping.tsx` within short timeframes on the 24th, and then another set of changes on the 25th to `productSearch.tsx`, `apiEndpoints.ts` and `shippingBasedService.tsx`. This indicates active development and iteration.
*   **Module/Component Structure:** The codebase follows a component-based architecture (React components) and a clear separation of concerns (e.g., `validations.ts` for validation logic, `apiEndpoints.ts` for API URLs, `api.ts` for API calls).
*   **Gokwik UI Kit:** Heavy reliance on a custom `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI components (Button, Card, Form, Input, Table, etc.).
*   **State Management:** Frequent use of `useState` and `useEffect` for component local state management, and `useAppDispatch` and `useSelector` (Redux) for global state.
*   **API Interactions:** Consistent pattern of making API calls using `makeAPICall` and referencing `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL + APIEndPoints.XYZ`.
*   **Error Handling and Validation:** Extensive client-side validation logic is present in both component files and the dedicated `validations.ts` file, indicating a focus on data integrity and user feedback (e.g., `message.error`).
*   **Shipping Configuration Focus:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around shipping settings, including price-based, weight-based, and discount-based shipping methods. The addition of "Product Based Shipping" further expands these functionalities.
*   **Modularity in Tabs:** The `ShippingService` component uses a `Tabs` component to organize different shipping configurations, and dynamically filters the `tabsList`.
*   **Placeholder Images:** The use of `ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage` and `ShopifyCollectionPlaceholderImage` suggests a frontend concern for handling missing image URLs gracefully.
*   **Filtering and Search:** Implementation of search and filter functionalities, especially in `ProductSearch` and the table in `WeightBaseShippingMethods`.

## 17:59:24

# Activity Summary for 13/11/2025

## 11:04:18
The `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` file, last modified on `12/11/2025, 21:20:24`, serves as a central service for managing shipping discounts, offers, and various related aspects of the order and checkout flow.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **Extensive State Management:** The service heavily relies on Svelte stores, subscribing to numerous states from `CommonStore`, `OrderStore`, and `LoginStore` to access and react to real-time cart, order, user, and merchant information. This includes tracking discount codes, shipping methods, gift cards, available offers, and flags like `isAbandonCart` or `modified_cart`.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** It incorporates dynamic configurations from `requestIdObject` to control features such as disabling discounts/COD with credits, auto-applying credits, showing discount confetti, and identifying available free gifts.
*   **API Orchestration:** It orchestrates calls to `discountShippingCall` (via `MerchantAPI`) and uses `createApiResponseQueue` to manage and sequentialize API responses, ensuring stable updates.
*   **UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   Triggers a `confetti` animation upon successful application of specific discount types, improving user feedback.
    *   Manages loader states and `skipToPayment` logic to control the user's flow and provide appropriate loading experiences.
    *   Updates bottom sheet states for address listing/input.
*   **Key Bug Fixes/Improvements (Referenced by CHECKOUT IDs):**
    *   **CHECKOUT-15842:** Implements a crucial fix to handle gift cards on cart updates. If the cart has been modified and gift cards are present, it clears existing gift cards, re-fetches them, and reapplies them to ensure accuracy.
    *   **CHECKOUT-12982:** Contains logic to directly call payment methods under specific conditions, particularly when on `currentPage === 7` and relevant shipping or discount responses are received.
*   **Discount and Shipping Logic:**
    *   Clears API timers when discounts are removed, optimizing resource usage.
    *   Integrates specific logic for "Gyftr" discounts, including removal and re-application based on `placeOrder` status and current page.
    *   Manages shipping method selection, including conditional calls to `addressListingBottomSheet` if shipping options are available but no method is selected.
*   **Event Logging & Error Handling:**
    *   Logs specific events, such as `loyalty_points_applied`, with detailed context about credits and auto-application.
    *   Provides specific error messages for `invalidChannel` based on the merchant's app flow.
    *   Includes conditional error message management, specifically excluding UI display for UTM auto-application failures.
    *   Implements a `discount_shipping_retry` mechanism with a `setTimeout` for delayed shipping method selection under certain conditions.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Svelte Store Dependency:** A significant pattern is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores for managing and reacting to application-wide state, indicating a highly reactive and interconnected architecture.
*   **Conditional Logic based on `currentPage`:** The variable `currentPage` (often checked for `currentPage === 7`) is a recurring condition, suggesting different flows or behaviors depending on the user's current stage in the checkout process, likely denoting the payment or review page.
*   **Integration with Multiple Services:** The file imports and interacts with numerous other service files (e.g., `MerchantAPI`, `EventService`, `GiftCard.service`, `Discounts.service`, `Helper.service`), highlighting its role as an orchestrator for various checkout-related functionalities.
*   **Focus on User Experience:** Recurring elements like confetti animation, loader management, and specific error message handling demonstrate a strong focus on providing a clear and responsive user experience during the discount and shipping stages of checkout.

# Activity Summary for 28/11/2025

## 07:51:38
The changes primarily revolve around integrating and refining a GoKwik checkout experience within a React Native WebView for an Appmaker Expo application.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` (and later `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`)**
    *   **27/11/2025, 18:51:28**: Introduced the `KwikPassCheckout` component, which acts as a wrapper for the `KPCheckout` (GoKwik) WebView. This component sets up event listeners for GoKwik SDK events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gk-checkout-disable`). The `orderSuccess` handler extracts Shopify order ID (`orderGID`) and a "key" from the `checkoutUrl` to trigger a `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action and conditionally performs `KWIKPASS_LOGIN`.
    *   **27/11/2025, 22:53:59**: Added `orderKeyRegexExtra` to allow for an alternative way of extracting the `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl`, making the extraction more robust. Debugging `console.log` statements were added around this time.
    *   **27/11/2025, 22:55:29 - 23:06:37**: A series of minor changes were logged, mainly involving the addition of numerous `console.log` statements to debug the order ID and key extraction logic within the `orderSuccess` event handler. A temporary issue where the `matches` variable was not explicitly declared or was missing its assignment appeared in some of these revisions, which could have led to runtime errors.
    *   **27/11/2025, 23:16:36**: This version correctly re-introduced the `matches` variable declaration, resolving the potential bug from earlier debugging efforts, and restored the `if (checkoutUrl && orderGID)` condition.
    *   **27/11/2025, 23:20:30**: The component's file path shifted from `packages/` to `src/`.
    *   **27/11/2025, 23:30:22**: A significant refactoring occurred within the `orderSuccess` handling. Instead of extracting order details and calling `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`, the logic was changed to directly redirect the user to the `checkoutUrl` within a WebView using `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW`. The `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` logic was also slightly clarified.
    *   **27/11/2025, 23:50:11**: The major refactoring from 23:30:22 was reverted. The component returned to its previous behavior of extracting `orderID`/`orderKey` and triggering `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`.
    *   **28/11/2025, 00:25:40**: Logic was added to the `orderSuccess` handler to ensure `checkoutUrl` is always prefixed with `https://` if it lacks a protocol.
    *   **28/11/2025, 00:44:33 & 00:46:02**: A temporary bug was introduced in the `checkoutUrl` normalization, where initializing `checkoutUrl` to `null` before checking its protocol prevented the `https://` prefixing from occurring. The file path briefly reverted to `packages/` then back to `src/` during these changes.
    *   **28/11/2025, 07:47:14 & 07:48:18**: The `checkoutUrl` normalization bug was fixed, ensuring the URL is correctly processed to have an `https://` prefix.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx` (27/11/2025, 18:54:00)**
    *   This file defines the `KPCheckout` React component, which serves as a memoized wrapper around the core `Checkout` component. It mainly passes through `checkoutData` and event handler props. The content remained stable.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx` (27/11/2025, 18:57:26 - 20:35:26)**
    *   This is the core WebView component responsible for displaying the GoKwik checkout. It includes:
        *   `injectJavaScript` for injecting event listeners (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gk-checkout-disable`) directly into the WebView's JavaScript context, which then posts messages back to the native app.
        *   Logic to construct the WebView URL based on merchant type (Shopify or custom), fetching configurations from `CacheInstance` and encoding parameters with Base64.
        *   Handlers for native app events like hardware back presses and app state changes, which are relayed to the WebView.
        *   `UPI_APP_PACKAGES` and related logic (`convertToIntentUrl`, `handlePaymentIntent`) for deep linking to various UPI payment applications on Android.
    *   The content of this file remained consistent across all logged timestamps, indicating a stable and functional implementation during this period.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **27/11/2025, 18:51:28**: Initial implementation of `KwikPassCheckout.js` with core GoKwik event handling.
*   **27/11/2025, 22:53:59**: Introduction of `orderKeyRegexExtra` for more robust order key extraction in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:16:36**: Crucial fix in `KwikPassCheckout.js` for the `matches` variable declaration, resolving a potential runtime error.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:20:30**: File relocation of `KwikPassCheckout.js` from `packages/` to `src/`.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:30:22**: Major functional refactor in `KwikPassCheckout.js` (`orderSuccess` now redirects to checkout URL instead of internal order completion).
*   **27/11/2025, 23:50:11**: Rollback of the 23:30:22 refactor in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **28/11/2025, 00:25:40**: Addition of `https://` URL normalization logic in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **28/11/2025, 00:44:33**: Introduction of a bug in `KwikPassCheckout.js` where `checkoutUrl` normalization was bypassed.
*   **28/11/2025, 07:47:14**: Correction of the `checkoutUrl` normalization bug in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **GoKwik SDK Event-Driven Logic**: A consistent pattern across `KwikPassCheckout.js` and `Checkout.tsx` is the heavy reliance on processing events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gk-checkout-disable`) originating from the GoKwik SDK within a WebView.
*   **Shopify Integration**: The code frequently handles Shopify-specific data, such as GraphQL Global IDs for carts and orders, and storefront access tokens.
*   **URL Parsing and Manipulation**: Regular expressions are extensively used to extract specific data (like order IDs and keys) from URLs. There's also a recurring concern about normalizing URLs to ensure they have the correct protocol (`https://`).
*   **Debugging Cycles**: The logs for `KwikPassCheckout.js` show a clear pattern of adding, modifying, and sometimes removing `console.log` statements, indicating active and iterative debugging during development, especially for the `orderSuccess` flow.
*   **File Path Fluctuation**: The `KwikPassCheckout.js` file path toggles between `packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/` and `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/` multiple times, suggesting possible refactoring, testing in different environments, or a migration in progress.
*   **Refactor and Revert**: A significant functional change in `KwikPassCheckout.js` (redirecting to checkout URL vs. internal order completion) was introduced and then reverted, highlighting an iterative development process or changes in implementation strategy.

## 08:51:02
The changes primarily revolve around implementing and refining a checkout flow using the `KwikPassCheckout` component within a React Native Expo application. This involves handling various events from a WebView, particularly for GoKwik SDK integration.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`** and **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`**:
    *   **Initial Change (27/11/2025, 18:51:28):** Introduced detailed event handling for `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable` events originating from the `gokwikSdk` within a WebView.
        *   For `orderSuccess`, it extracts `checkoutUrl`, `graphqlOrderId`, `gk_access_token`, and `email`. It attempts to parse Shopify order ID and key from these. It also includes logic to automatically log in the user via `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` if an email and `gkAccessToken` are present and the user isn't already logged in.
        *   `openInBrowserTab` handles opening URLs in a WebView or via custom URL schemes.
        *   `gk-checkout-disable` triggers an action to open the native Shopify checkout.
    *   **Minor Iterations (27/11/2025, 18:52:00 to 27/11/2025, 22:55:45):** These timestamps show repeated content, suggesting minor saves or reformatting without functional changes, possibly debugging or local testing.
    *   **Refinement in `orderSuccess` (27/11/2025, 22:53:59):** Added a `console.log` for "=== Matches for order key ===" within the `orderSuccess` handler, indicating an attempt to debug or verify the regex matching for `orderKey`.
    *   **Further Debugging and Consolidation (27/11/2025, 22:59:03 to 27/11/2025, 23:06:37):** Multiple updates focused on adding more `console.log` statements within the `orderSuccess` event handler, specifically around the extraction of `orderId` and `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl` and `orderGID`. This indicates active debugging of the order completion logic. The path `packages/kwikpassV2` and `src/kwikpassV2` alternate, potentially due to build or test environment configurations.
    *   **Significant Refinement to `orderSuccess` (27/11/2025, 23:16:36):** Introduced a new regex `orderKeyRegexExtra = /\/orders\/([^/?#]+)/` to more robustly extract the `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl`. The `matches` variable now attempts to match with either `orderKeyRegex` or `orderKeyRegexExtra`, enhancing flexibility for different URL formats.
    *   **Additional Logging in `orderSuccess` (27/11/2025, 23:16:45):** Added `console.log("ORDER KEY MATCHES", matches)` for debugging the newly added regex.
    *   **Major Structural Change in `orderSuccess` (27/11/2025, 23:30:22):** The `orderSuccess` case was significantly refactored.
        *   It now explicitly checks for the `orderSuccessBody`.
        *   The order ID extraction logic is clarified with comments, explicitly focusing on extracting from GraphQL GID.
        *   **Crucially, it changed the handling of `checkoutUrl`:** Instead of trying to extract an `orderKey` and rebuild a Shopify URL, it now directly redirects the user to the `checkoutUrl` provided by GoKwik using `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW`. It explicitly states in comments that the `checkoutUrl` is *always* the correct redirect page and one should *not* manually extract keys or rebuild URLs.
        *   The auto-login logic using `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` is also clarified.
    *   **Reverted `orderSuccess` logic (27/11/2025, 23:50:11):** The logic for extracting `orderKey` using `orderKeyRegex` and `orderKeyRegexExtra` (which was removed in the previous major refactor) was reintroduced, suggesting a rollback or re-evaluation of the direct `checkoutUrl` redirection strategy.
    *   **Checkout URL Protocol Handling (28/11/2025, 00:25:40):** Added logic to prepend `https://` to `checkoutUrl` if it doesn't already start with `http://` or `https://`, ensuring valid URL formation for WebView.
    *   **Refined Checkout URL Protocol Handling (28/11/2025, 00:44:33 to 28/11/2025, 07:55:36):** The logic for prepending `https://` was slightly modified. The `checkoutUrl` variable was initially `null`, then assigned within the `if` block, leading to `checkoutUrl` potentially remaining `null` if it already started with `http(s)`. This was fixed in subsequent commits to correctly assign `checkoutUrl` from `message.data?.orderSuccessBody?.checkoutUrl` first and then check for and prepend `https://` if needed. The last few timestamps represent a stable version of this fix.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx` (27/11/2025, 18:54:00):**
    *   This file exports the `KPCheckout` component, which acts as a wrapper for the `Checkout` component.
    *   The primary change visible is the addition of `orderTags` to the `Checkout` component's props, indicating that order tags can now be passed down to the underlying WebView. The `handleCheckoutMessage` callback ensures that `onEvent` prop is called with messages from the WebView.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx` (27/11/2025, 18:57:26 to 27/11/2025, 20:35:26):**
    *   This file contains the core `WebView` implementation for the KwikPass checkout.
    *   **Key additions:**
        *   An `injectJavaScript` string is defined to listen for `gokwikSdk` events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`) and `gokwikLoaded`, `message`, and `gk-checkout-disable` events from the WebView, posting them back to the native React Native context via `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage`. This ensures communication between the web environment and the native app.
        *   A `UPI_APP_PACKAGES` object maps UPI app names to Android package IDs.
        *   `InitiateCheckout` function is enhanced to handle `custom` merchant types in addition to `shopify`, dynamically constructing the WebView URL based on merchant configuration, user data (email), and environment. It now uses `base64` encoding for `storeInfo` and `gkToken` when building Shopify checkout URLs.
        *   Logic for setting `orderTags` based on platform (iOS/Android) if not explicitly provided is added.
        *   `backButtonHandler` is implemented to manage WebView navigation history or post a "hardwareBackPress" message.
        *   `useEffect` hooks are used to set up and tear down listeners for hardware back presses and app state changes, ensuring the WebView receives these events.
        *   `showAlert`, `convertToIntentUrl`, and `handlePaymentIntent` functions are introduced to manage UPI payment intents, including error handling for "UPI_APP_NOT_INSTALLED" and converting URLs to Android intent URLs for specific UPI apps. This is a significant addition for handling native UPI flows.
        *   The `handleMessage` callback parses messages from the WebView and retrieves `merchantType` from `CacheInstance`.
    *   The multiple timestamps for this file (18:57:26, 18:59:47, 20:20:11, 20:35:26) show no discernible functional differences, suggesting minor saves or rebuilds.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **GoKwik SDK Integration:** The primary focus across all relevant files is the integration with the `gokwikSdk`. Events like `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable` are consistently listened for and handled.
*   **WebView Communication:** There's a clear pattern of using `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage` in the injected JavaScript within `Checkout.tsx` to send events from the WebView back to the native `KwikPassCheckout.js` component, and `webViewRef.current.postMessage` to send events from native to the WebView.
*   **Shopify Integration:** The code frequently deals with Shopify-specific IDs (`gid://shopify/Shop/`, `gid://shopify/Cart/`, `gid://shopify/Order/`), storefront access tokens, and actions (`SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`, `KWIKPASS_LOGIN`, `OPEN_SHOPIFY_NATIVE_CHECKOUT`).
*   **URL Handling:** Extensive logic is dedicated to parsing, validating, and sometimes modifying URLs, particularly for `orderSuccess` (extracting order details) and `openInBrowserTab` (determining how to open external links). A recurring task is to ensure `checkoutUrl` has a proper protocol (`https://`).
*   **Debugging/Logging:** Frequent `console.log` statements throughout the code, especially in the `KwikPassCheckout.js` file, indicate active development and debugging during these changes.
*   **User Authentication:** The `orderSuccess` event consistently includes logic to check if a user is logged in and, if not, to perform a `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` using details from the GoKwik SDK response.
*   **Timestamps:** All significant changes occurred on **27/11/2025** and **28/11/2025**, indicating a concentrated period of development and refinement. The numerous changes within minutes suggest rapid iterations, likely during active testing or debugging sessions.

## 11:22:49
The log primarily details changes across two main code files related to a KwikPass checkout integration within an AppMaker starter application, spanning from November 27th to November 28th, 2025. The `.env` file updates have been excluded as per instructions.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`**
    *(Note: This file path, and its `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/` counterpart, show continuous development activity and will be summarized together due to identical content and timestamps.)*

    *   **Initial State (27/11/2025, 18:51:28):** The `KwikPassCheckout` component integrates the `KPCheckout` (GoKwik) functionality into a React Native application. It listens for events from the embedded WebView, specifically `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable`. Key logic exists within the `orderSuccess` handler to extract `checkoutUrl` and `graphqlOrderId`, then parse `orderId` and `orderKey` using regex patterns (`orderIdRegex`, `orderKeyRegex`). After extraction, it dispatches a `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action and conditionally initiates `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` if the user is not already logged in. URL handling for `openInBrowserTab` differentiates between HTTP/HTTPS and custom schemes.
    *   **Debugging and Minor Adjustments (27/11/2025, 18:52:00 - 27/11/2025, 23:16:45):** This period is characterized by numerous minor modifications, predominantly adding and refining `console.log` statements for debugging `checkoutURL`, `orderId`, `orderKey`, and regex matches within the `orderSuccess` event handler. There was an introduction of `orderKeyRegexExtra` at 23:16:36 to enhance `orderKey` extraction robustness, attempting to match additional URL patterns. A temporary bug seems to have been introduced around 23:03:24 where the `matches` variable for `orderKey` extraction was not correctly scoped/defined after a condition change.
    *   **Major Refactor and Reversion (27/11/2025, 23:30:22 - 27/11/2025, 23:50:11):**
        *   At **27/11/2025, 23:30:22**, a significant refactoring occurred within the `orderSuccess` handler. This update clearly delineated three steps: extracting Shopify Order ID, redirecting the customer to the `checkoutUrl` via `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` (explicitly stating *not* to manually extract or rebuild Shopify URLs), and auto-login using the KwikPass token. This version removed the direct `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action with `orderKey`.
        *   However, by **27/11/2025, 23:50:11**, this refactoring was largely reverted. The code returned to the previous pattern of extracting `orderKey` using `orderKeyRegex` and then calling `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`, re-introducing the `orderKeyRegexExtra` pattern.
    *   **`checkoutUrl` Protocol Handling (28/11/2025, 00:25:40 - 28/11/2025, 07:55:36):** Several updates iteratively refined how `checkoutUrl` is handled. The core change in this period was adding logic to automatically prepend `https://` to `checkoutUrl` if it lacked a protocol, ensuring it's a valid, secure URL before further processing.
    *   **`SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` Parameter Refinement (28/11/2025, 11:09:45 - 28/11/2025, 11:13:51):** The `orderKey` extraction was again adjusted, with `orderKeyRegexExtra` removed in some versions, and the `orderKey` parameter for `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` becoming `orderKey || ''` to ensure it's always a string. Notably, at **28/11/2025, 11:12:09**, the condition for dispatching `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` changed from `if (orderId && orderKey)` to `if (orderId || orderKey)`, indicating that either an `orderId` or `orderKey` might be sufficient to consider the order complete for internal tracking.

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx`**
    *   **Consistency (27/11/2025, 18:54:00):** This file remains consistent across the log. It acts as a wrapper for the core `Checkout` component, passing various `merchantParams` and event handlers. A debugging `console.log` statement for `checkoutData` is present.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx`**
    *   **Consistency (27/11/2025, 18:57:26 - 27/11/2025, 20:35:26):** This file also remains unchanged in the provided logs. It contains the WebView implementation details, including injected JavaScript for SDK event listeners, logic for initiating checkout based on merchant type, handling app state and back button, and specific functions for UPI deep linking (`showAlert`, `convertToIntentUrl`, `handlePaymentIntent`). The injected JavaScript sets up listeners for GoKwik SDK events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gokwik_events`, `gk-checkout-disable`) and posts them to the React Native context.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **GoKwik Checkout Integration Focus:** The changes are entirely centered around enhancing and debugging the integration of the KwikPass/GoKwik checkout flow within a React Native application using a WebView.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The system heavily relies on event listeners within the WebView's injected JavaScript to communicate GoKwik SDK events back to the native React Native component.
*   **Debugging Effort:** The sheer number of `console.log` additions and removals, particularly in `KwikPassCheckout.js`, highlights an intensive debugging and refinement process, especially concerning the parsing of order details and URL handling post-checkout.
*   **Robustness for URL Parsing:** There's a recurring challenge and effort to make the extraction of Shopify order IDs and keys from checkout URLs more resilient to different formats, evidenced by the introduction and modification of regex patterns.
*   **Protocol Enforcement:** Consistent attempts to ensure `checkoutUrl` uses the `https://` protocol indicate a focus on secure and reliable navigation.
*   **Login Flow Management:** The logic to check for an existing user session before triggering a KwikPass auto-login based on GoKwik access tokens is a consistent feature.
*   **Rapid Iteration:** The tight clustering of timestamps (all within 27th and 28th November 2025) suggests rapid iteration and problem-solving, with some changes being reverted or modified shortly after their introduction.

## 12:22:46
The changes primarily revolve around the integration and debugging of a "GoKwik" checkout system within a React Native Expo application, specifically within the `KwikPassCheckout` component.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` (and later `/src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`)**
    *   **Initial State (27/11/2025, 18:51:28):** This file defines the `KwikPassCheckout` React component, which acts as a wrapper for `KPCheckout` from an Appmaker package. It includes an `onEvent` handler for messages from the WebView. Key events handled are `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable`.
        *   For `orderSuccess`, it extracts `checkoutUrl` and `graphqlOrderId` to determine a Shopify `orderId` and `orderKey` (using `orderKeyRegex = /[?&]key=([^&#]*)/;`) and then dispatches a `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action. It also includes logic to `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` if a user's `email` and `gk_access_token` are available and the user isn't already logged in.
    *   **Debugging and Regex Refinements (27/11/2025, 22:53:59 - 23:16:45):** Multiple small changes and additions of `console.log` statements were made to debug the `orderSuccess` flow. Specifically, an additional regex (`orderKeyRegexExtra = /\/orders\/([^/?#]+)/;`) was introduced at **27/11/2025, 23:16:36** to robustly extract the `orderKey` from the `checkoutUrl` by trying both the original and the new regex.
    *   **Major Refactor of `orderSuccess` (27/11/2025, 23:30:22, after a path change to `/src/`):** The `orderSuccess` handler was significantly refactored.
        *   The explicit extraction of `orderKey` and the `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action were removed.
        *   Instead, upon `orderSuccess`, the component now explicitly redirects the user to the `checkoutUrl` provided by GoKwik using an `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action.
        *   The Shopify `orderId` is still extracted from `graphqlOrderId`.
        *   The `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` logic remains, with improved variable naming and comments.
        *   Extensive comments were added to explain the new logic steps: Extracting Shopify Order ID, redirecting to GoKwik's `checkoutUrl`, and auto-login.
    *   **Partial Reversion and URL Protocol Handling (28/11/2025, 00:25:40 - 07:55:36):**
        *   The `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action, along with the `orderKeyRegex` and `orderKeyRegexExtra` for extracting `orderKey`, was reintroduced at **28/11/2025, 00:25:40**, partially reverting the prior refactor.
        *   Logic was added and subsequently refined to ensure the `checkoutUrl` always starts with `https://` if it doesn't already have an HTTP/HTTPS protocol, addressing potential issues with relative or un-prefixed URLs. This refinement is noticeable across several timestamps, with the most robust check appearing around **28/11/2025, 07:55:12**.
    *   **Final Adjustments to `orderSuccess` (28/11/2025, 11:09:45 - 11:13:51):**
        *   The `orderKeyRegexExtra` was removed, relying solely on `orderKeyRegex = /[?&]key=([^&#]*)/` for `orderKey` extraction.
        *   The condition for dispatching `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` was briefly changed to `if (orderId || orderKey)` then reverted back to `if (orderId && orderKey)`, and `orderKey` was made optional (`orderKey:orderKey || ''`).

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx`**
    *   **Initial State (27/11/2025, 18:54:00):** This file defines the `KPCheckout` component, which orchestrates the data passed to the underlying `Checkout` component (defined in `Checkout.tsx`). It forwards events via the `onEvent` prop and passes various merchant-related parameters.

    *   **Initial State (27/11/2025, 18:57:26):** This file contains the core WebView implementation for the GoKwik checkout. It injects JavaScript into the WebView to listen for `gokwikSdk` events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`) and `gk-checkout-disable`, posting them back to the React Native context. It handles UPI deep linking, app state changes, and back button presses. The `InitiateCheckout` function constructs the WebView URL based on merchant type (Shopify/Custom) and other parameters, encoding sensitive information with Base64.
    *   **No functional changes are recorded for this file across all provided timestamps.** The content remains consistent from 27/11/2025, 18:57:26 through 27/11/2025, 20:35:26.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on GoKwik Checkout Integration**: The primary theme is managing the GoKwik checkout flow, specifically handling its success, closure, and navigation events within a React Native WebView.
*   **Event-Driven Communication**: A consistent pattern of listening for events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gk-checkout-disable`) from the WebView (originating from the GoKwik SDK) and translating them into actions within the native application.
*   **Shopify Order ID and Key Extraction**: There's a recurring effort to accurately extract Shopify's `orderID` from `graphqlOrderId` and `orderKey` from the `checkoutUrl` using regular expressions, indicating potential challenges or variations in how these identifiers are provided by the GoKwik SDK or Shopify.
*   **User Login Flow**: The logic to automatically log in a user (`KWIKPASS_LOGIN`) using a `gk_access_token` and `email` if they aren't already logged in is a persistent feature.
*   **URL Normalization**: Repeated adjustments to ensure `checkoutUrl` is a valid, absolute HTTPS URL, suggesting issues with inconsistent URL formats received from the GoKwik SDK.
*   **Debugging**: Frequent console logging (`console.log`) was added throughout the development process, particularly in the `orderSuccess` event handler, to trace variable values and execution paths.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: The timestamps show a very active development period spanning just over a day (27/11/2025, 17:45:53 to 28/11/2025, 11:13:51), with numerous small adjustments and a significant refactor followed by partial reversions and further refinements.

## 13:23:58
The code changes primarily focus on refining the integration of the GoKwik checkout process within a React Native application, particularly concerning post-order success handling and URL management within WebViews.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` (and `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` which appears to be a copy/move of the same file at different times)**
    *   **Initial Changes (27/11/2025, 18:51:28 - 18:52:00)**: Established the core `KwikPassCheckout` component, responsible for handling various events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gk-checkout-disable`) from an embedded `KPCheckout` (WebView-based) component. It extracts Shopify `orderID` and `orderKey` from `orderSuccess` data and attempts a `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` if the user is not authenticated.
    *   **Debugging and `orderKey` Extraction Fluctuations (27/11/2025, 22:53:59 - 23:06:37)**: Multiple commits introduced and removed console logging for debugging. A bug was introduced where the `orderKey` regex matching was inadvertently removed from the `orderSuccess` handler, then partially restored with new debug logs, and the `orderSuccess` condition was temporarily simplified from `if (checkoutUrl && orderGID)` to `if (checkoutUrl)`.
    *   **`orderKey` Extraction Refinement (27/11/2025, 23:16:36 - 23:16:45)**: The `orderKey` extraction logic was made more robust by adding `orderKeyRegexExtra` to handle alternative URL patterns for the order key.
    *   **Significant `orderSuccess` Refactoring (27/11/2025, 23:30:22)**: A major change was introduced to the `orderSuccess` handler. It completely removed the `orderKey` extraction and the `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action with an `orderKey`. Instead, it focused on extracting only the `orderID` and then directly performing an `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action to redirect the user to the `checkoutUrl` provided by GoKwik, along with simplified `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` logic.
    *   **Partial Reversion of Refactoring (27/11/2025, 23:50:11)**: This refactoring was largely reverted, bringing back the `orderKey` extraction (though `orderKeyRegexExtra` was removed again) and the `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action.
    *   **`checkoutUrl` Protocol Handling (28/11/2025, 00:25:40 - 07:55:36)**: Several iterations focused on ensuring the `checkoutUrl` always includes a `https://` prefix if missing. This involved fixing a logical error in the conditional assignment and refining the `startsWith` checks for `http://` and `https://`.
    *   **`SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` Parameter and Condition Changes (28/11/2025, 11:09:45 - 11:13:51)**: The `orderKey` parameter in `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` was given a fallback empty string (`orderKey || ''`). The condition for calling `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` was relaxed from `orderId && orderKey` to `orderId || orderKey`.
    *   **Re-evaluation of Post-Order Navigation (28/11/2025, 12:25:54 - 12:41:56)**: The `orderSuccess` handling saw further significant changes. The local `checkoutUrl` variable was initially commented out, and the `orderKey` extraction was removed. A new `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action was introduced to navigate to a constructed `thank_you` page using `shopDomain` and `orderId`. This was quickly revised to use the `checkoutUrl` provided by the GoKwik event. The `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action was commented out, then re-added with `orderKey: ''`, and finally with `orderKey: orderKey || ''`, alongside complex and sometimes problematic logic for determining when to open a `checkoutUrl` via `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` versus just calling `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Commit (27/11/2025, 18:54:00)**: This file defines the `KPCheckout` component, serving as a wrapper that passes `checkoutData` and event handlers to the underlying `Checkout` component. It uses `memo` for performance and logs the rendering process. No functional changes observed after this point.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx`**
    *   **Initial Commit (27/11/2025, 18:57:26)**: This file contains the core `Checkout` component, embedding a `WebView`. It injects JavaScript to listen for `gokwikSdk` events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gk-checkout-disable`) and relays them back to the native side. It handles constructing the `webviewUrl` based on merchant type (Shopify/custom) and encodes data using `base64`. It also includes logic for handling hardware back presses, app state changes, displaying alerts (especially for UPI app installation issues), and managing UPI payment intents by converting URLs to Android intents.
    *   **Subsequent Commits (27/11/2025, 18:59:47 - 20:35:26)**: No substantial code changes were observed in this file across these timestamps, indicating stable implementation or minor non-functional saves.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/11/2025, 18:51:28**: Initial implementation of `KwikPassCheckout.js` with basic event handling.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:16:36**: `orderKey` extraction logic improved for robustness in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:30:22**: Major functional change in `KwikPassCheckout.js` to simplify `orderSuccess` handling, removing `orderKey` and relying on `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` to the checkout URL.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:50:11**: Reversion of the `23:30:22` changes in `KwikPassCheckout.js`, restoring `orderKey` extraction and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action.
*   **28/11/2025, 00:25:40**: Introduction of `checkoutUrl` protocol prefixing logic in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **28/11/2025, 07:47:14 - 07:55:12**: Iterative refinements and corrections to the `checkoutUrl` protocol prefixing logic in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:25:54**: Another major shift in `KwikPassCheckout.js`'s `orderSuccess` handling, commenting out local `checkoutUrl` and `orderKey` extraction, introducing a constructed `thank_you` page URL for `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW`.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:37:42**: Revision to use the actual `checkoutUrl` for `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` instead of a constructed `thank_you` page in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:41:56**: Further changes in `KwikPassCheckout.js` regarding conditional `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` with a potentially empty `orderKey`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **GoKwik SDK Integration**: Both `KwikPassCheckout.js` and `Checkout.tsx` are deeply involved in integrating the GoKwik SDK, using a WebView to display the checkout and listen for SDK-specific events.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture**: Communication between the WebView and the native React Native component (`KwikPassCheckout`) is consistently handled through message passing and a centralized `onEvent` callback.
*   **Order Success Handling Complexity**: The logic for processing the `orderSuccess` event is the most volatile and frequently modified section. It consistently struggles with:
    *   Accurately extracting `orderID` from a GraphQL GID.
    *   Robustly extracting `orderKey` from the `checkoutUrl` (sometimes present, sometimes removed).
    *   Determining the correct post-checkout navigation strategy (e.g., `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` vs. `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` to a thank you page or the original `checkoutUrl`).
    *   Ensuring URLs have correct `http(s)://` prefixes.
*   **User Login Integration**: The `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` action is a recurring part of the `orderSuccess` flow, triggered if an email and access token are provided and the user is not already logged in.
*   **Debugging Statements**: Frequent addition and removal of `console.log` statements throughout the development log, indicating active debugging and testing, especially around the `orderSuccess` flow.
*   **File Path Instability**: The `KwikPassCheckout.js` file appears to have been moved or copied between `packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/` and `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/` multiple times, suggesting possible refactoring of the project structure or testing different locations.

## 14:23:00
The code changes primarily focus on the integration and refinement of a GoKwik checkout process within an Appmaker Expo application, specifically handling events and data flow from a WebView.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` (and its `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` counterpart):**
    *   This React Native component orchestrates the GoKwik checkout flow.
    *   **Initial Implementation (27/11/2025, 18:51:28):** It was set up to listen for various events from the GoKwik WebView, including `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, and `gk-checkout-disable`. Upon `orderSuccess`, it extracted Shopify `orderId` (from a GraphQL GID) and `orderKey` (from the `checkoutUrl` using regex), then dispatched `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` and conditionally `KWIKPASS_LOGIN`.
    *   **Debugging Enhancements (27/11/2025, 22:53:59 - 23:06:37):** Multiple `console.log` statements were added, modified, and refined to debug the extraction of order IDs and keys, and to trace execution flow within the `orderSuccess` handler.
    *   **Order Key Extraction Improvement (27/11/2025, 23:16:36):** An `orderKeyRegexExtra` was introduced to robustly match `orderKey` from different URL patterns within the `checkoutUrl`.
    *   **Temporary Refactor and Reversion (27/11/2025, 23:30:22 & 23:50:11):** A significant change was introduced to directly redirect to the `checkoutUrl` via `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` on `orderSuccess`, removing the explicit `orderKey` extraction and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action. This change was subsequently reverted, bringing back the previous explicit order key extraction and `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` logic.
    *   **Checkout URL Protocol Normalization (28/11/2025, 00:25:40 - 07:55:36):** Several iterations focused on ensuring the `checkoutUrl` received from GoKwik always starts with `https://` or `http://`, prepending `https://` if missing. There were a few minor logical errors in this process that were quickly corrected.
    *   **Order Completion & Navigation Refinement (28/11/2025, 11:09:45 - 12:41:56):**
        *   The logic for assigning `orderKey` became more resilient (e.g., `orderKey || ''`).
        *   A major change (28/11/2025, 12:25:54) involved abandoning `orderKey` extraction from `checkoutUrl` for `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`. Instead, it started constructing a Shopify `thank_you` page URL using the `orderId` and `shopDomain` for `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW`. `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` was then called with an empty `orderKey`.
        *   Subsequent changes in this period saw `checkoutUrl` handling for `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` being refined again, ensuring proper `https://` prefixing.
        *   The final significant change (28/11/2025, 12:41:56) reinstated the extraction of `orderKey` using `orderKeyRegex` and made the `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action conditional, executing only if `orderKey` was not found. This indicates a hybrid approach where the system attempts to get `orderKey`, but falls back to direct `checkoutUrl` navigation if it's absent.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx` (27/11/2025, 18:54:00):**
    *   This file serves as a wrapper for the core `Checkout` component, passing `merchantParams` (like `cartId`, `storefrontToken`, `sessionId`, `utmParams`, and various tracking IDs) from its props to the underlying `Checkout` component. It also includes a `console.log` for debugging the `checkoutData`.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx` (27/11/2025, 18:57:26 - 20:35:26):**
    *   This file defines the `WebView` component responsible for rendering the GoKwik checkout.
    *   It contains `injectJavaScript` to set up communication between the WebView and the native React Native environment, listening for `gokwikSdk` events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, `gokwik_events`, `gk-checkout-disable`).
    *   The `InitiateCheckout` function dynamically constructs the `webviewUrl` based on whether the merchant type is "shopify" or "custom", fetching configuration from `CacheInstance` and encoding `storeInfoData` (which includes cart data and analytics IDs) using Base64.
    *   It also includes robust handling for UPI payment intents (`UPI_APP_PACKAGES`, `convertToIntentUrl`, `handlePaymentIntent`) and app state/back button management.
    *   No significant code changes were observed in the multiple entries for this file after its initial content, indicating a stable implementation within the provided log range.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **27/11/2025, 18:51:28:** Initial commit/save of `KwikPassCheckout.js` in `packages/` with core event handling.
*   **27/11/2025, 18:57:26:** Initial commit/save of `Checkout.tsx`, defining the WebView logic and event injection.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:16:36:** `orderKeyRegexExtra` introduced in `KwikPassCheckout.js` for enhanced `orderKey` extraction.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:30:22:** A major, albeit temporary, refactor in `KwikPassCheckout.js` to change `orderSuccess` handling to direct URL redirection.
*   **27/11/2025, 23:50:11:** The 23:30:22 refactor was reverted in `KwikPassCheckout.js`.
*   **28/11/2025, 00:25:40:** First attempt to normalize `checkoutUrl` by prepending `https://` in `KwikPassCheckout.js`. This logic saw several subsequent refinements and corrections.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:25:54:** A significant shift in `KwikPassCheckout.js` for `orderSuccess`, moving away from parsing `checkoutUrl` for `orderKey` towards constructing a Shopify thank-you page URL and then dispatching `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` with an empty `orderKey`.
*   **28/11/2025, 12:41:56:** The final iteration of `KwikPassCheckout.js` in the log, re-introducing `orderKey` extraction from `checkoutUrl` and making the `OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW` action conditional on `orderKey`'s absence.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Debugging:** Numerous `console.log` statements are added and modified throughout the changes, particularly in `KwikPassCheckout.js`, indicating an active debugging process to understand and verify data flow and logic.
*   **Refinement of Order Success Flow:** The `orderSuccess` event handler in `KwikPassCheckout.js` is the most frequently adjusted section, showcasing a continuous effort to correctly process order information, handle user login, and manage post-checkout navigation within the hybrid app environment. This includes handling Shopify-specific GIDs and order keys.
*   **URL Handling Robustness:** Efforts are seen to ensure URLs are correctly formatted (e.g., prepending `https://`) and that the app can handle various URL schemes, including deep links for UPI payments.
*   **Code Synchronization/Relocation:** The presence of `KwikPassCheckout.js` in both `packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/` and `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/` with similar, evolving code indicates either a refactor where the component is being moved or a mechanism to sync changes across different parts of the project structure.
*   **GoKwik SDK Event-Driven Architecture:** The system relies heavily on messages and events emitted by the GoKwik SDK within the WebView to drive actions in the native application.

## 15:22:37
The changes across the provided log primarily focus on the **KwikPass checkout integration within an Appmaker Expo starter application**. The timestamps indicate that most activity occurred on **November 27th and 28th, 2025**, with a heavy concentration of changes on the latter date, particularly in the morning.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` and `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` (multiple updates throughout)**:
    *   This file, representing the core KwikPass Checkout component, saw numerous, mostly iterative, updates.
    *   **Initial Focus (27/11, 18:51 - 23:16):** The primary logic revolves around handling various events (`modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gk-checkout-disable`) received from a WebView, which likely hosts the GoKwik SDK.
    *   **Order Success Handling Evolution:**
        *   Initially, it attempted to extract both `orderId` and `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl` and `orderGID` using multiple regex patterns (`orderKeyRegex`, `orderKeyRegexExtra`).
        *   Around `27/11, 23:00:27`, there were console logs added (`"checkoutURL Is Coming"`, `"orderId Is Coming"`, `"This is coming from here"`) to debug the extraction of `orderId` and `orderKey`.
        *   Between `27/11, 23:03:24` and `27/11, 23:16:45`, the logic for extracting `orderKey` and `orderId` was refined, introducing additional regex (`orderKeyRegexExtra`) and debugging console logs (`"ORDER KEY MATCHES"`).
        *   Significantly, at `27/11, 23:30:22`, the `orderSuccess` handling was refactored. The explicit extraction of `orderKey` using regex was removed. Instead, for successful orders, the component now directly opens the `checkoutUrl` provided by GoKwik in a WebView (`OPEN_IN_WEBVIEW`) and then dispatches a `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` action with `orderID` (extracted from `graphqlOrderId`) and an empty `orderKey`. This suggests a change in how order completion is handled, potentially delegating the final "thank you" page display to the WebView directly using the GoKwik provided `checkoutUrl`.
        *   Further refinements to the `checkoutUrl` handling were observed on `28/11`, specifically for ensuring the URL starts with `https://` if missing.
        *   Starting from `28/11, 12:25:54`, the `orderSuccess` handling shifted. It now constructs a Shopify "thank you" page URL using the `orderId` and `shopDomain` (`https://[shopDomain]/thank_you?order_id=[orderId]`) and opens this in a WebView, then dispatches `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE` with `orderID` and an empty `orderKey`. This indicates a transition from relying on GoKwik's `checkoutUrl` for the thank you page to generating a native Shopify thank you page URL.
        *   There were minor console log additions (`"ORDER ID =========="`, `"ORDER KEY =========="`) for debugging purposes.
    *   **User Login:** The component includes logic to check if a user is already logged in and, if not, triggers a `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` action with the user's email and a GoKwik access token received from the `orderSuccess` event.
    *   **Navigation:** It handles navigation events, specifically checking for home page URLs and triggering a `GO_TO_HOME` action.
    *   **`webViewCanHandleCurrentUrl`:** This utility is used for handling custom URL schemes.
    *   **Code Duplication:** There are two distinct paths for `KwikPassCheckout.js`: `packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` and `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js`. The content across these paths is largely identical in each timestamp, suggesting either a build step discrepancy, a refactor to a new location that wasn't fully committed uniformly, or a temporary duplicate. The updates after `27/11, 23:20:40` seem to mainly occur in the `packages` path, but one last change to `src/kwikpassV2` happened at `28/11, 07:55:36`.

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/index.tsx` (27/11, 18:54:00):**
    *   This file imports the `Checkout` component and acts as a wrapper.
    *   It defines the `KPCheckout` functional component, passing `checkoutData` and event handlers (`onEvent`, `onError`, `onNavigationStateChange`) to the underlying `Checkout` component.
    *   It includes a `handleCheckoutMessage` callback to forward messages from the `Checkout` component's WebView to the `onEvent` prop.
    *   A `console.log` statement was added to track when `KPCheckout` renders with its data.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/node_modules/@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package/src/checkout/Checkout.tsx` (multiple updates between 27/11, 18:57:26 and 27/11, 20:35:26):**
    *   This file defines the `Checkout` React Native component, which renders a `WebView` to display the GoKwik checkout.
    *   **WebView Injection:** It contains `injectJavaScript` code that sets up event listeners within the WebView for `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gokwikLoaded`, and `gk-checkout-disable` events from the `gokwikSdk` and `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage` to communicate these events back to the native React Native context.
    *   **Checkout Initiation:** The `InitiateCheckout` useCallback constructs the `webviewUrl` based on whether the merchant type is "shopify" or "custom," retrieving various IDs and tokens from `CacheInstance`. It encodes `storeInfo` and `gkToken` using Base64.
    *   **UPI Deep Linking:** Includes `UPI_APP_PACKAGES` constants and logic (`convertToIntentUrl`, `handlePaymentIntent`) to handle UPI deep linking, showing platform-specific alerts if a UPI app is not installed.
    *   **Error Handling:** It provides a `handleError` callback that uses `handleApiError` and an `showAlert` utility.
    *   **Navigation & App State:** It sets up `BackHandler` and `AppState` listeners to communicate hardware back presses and app state changes to the WebView.
    *   The content of this file remained consistent across its multiple updates in the log, suggesting no functional changes were recorded for these specific timestamps in this file.

4.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/packages/kwikpassV2/src/pages/CheckoutOptions.js` (28/11, 14:48:50 & 14:52:20):**
    *   This file defines a `CheckoutOptions` configuration object, which includes a block for `'kwikpass/checkout'` with a `clientId` of `'kwikpass-checkout'`.
    *   This configuration appears to be static and defines how the KwikPass checkout component is integrated into the Appmaker application's page structure.
    *   The content is identical across both timestamps, indicating no functional changes.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **GoKwik Integration:** The entire log revolves around the integration and refinement of the "GoKwik" checkout system within the Appmaker framework, specifically for Shopify.
*   **WebView Communication:** A consistent pattern is the use of `WebView` for the GoKwik checkout, with JavaScript injection (`injectJavaScript`) to establish communication channels (via `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage`) between the WebView's content (GoKwik SDK) and the native React Native application.
*   **Event-Driven Architecture:** The `onEvent` callback and `switch` statements handling `message.eventname` (e.g., `modal_closed`, `orderSuccess`, `openInBrowserTab`, `gk-checkout-disable`) demonstrate a strong event-driven pattern for managing the checkout flow.
*   **Shopify Order ID/Key Extraction and Handling:** There's a recurring challenge and evolving solution for correctly extracting Shopify `orderId` and `orderKey` after a successful GoKwik checkout. This includes using regex patterns on `graphqlOrderId` and `checkoutUrl`. The approach shifted from trying to extract `orderKey` from `checkoutUrl` to directly opening a generated Shopify thank you page URL and setting an empty `orderKey` in `SET_ORDER_COMPLETE`.
*   **User Login Flow:** A recurring step after a successful order is to check the user's login status and, if not logged in, trigger a `KWIKPASS_LOGIN` using credentials provided by the GoKwik SDK.
*   **URL Normalization:** Multiple updates involve ensuring `checkoutUrl` or other URLs are properly prefixed with `https://`.
*   **Debugging Console Logs:** Frequent additions and modifications to `console.log` statements throughout the `KwikPassCheckout.js` file indicate active debugging efforts during these development sessions. This suggests a period of intensive testing and troubleshooting related to the order completion flow and URL handling.
*   **Redundancy in File Paths:** The presence of `packages/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` and `src/kwikpassV2/src/components/KwikPassCheckout.js` with near-identical content and simultaneous updates points to possible issues with project structure, build processes, or an incomplete refactoring of file locations.

In summary, the logs illustrate the active development and debugging of a critical checkout component, particularly focusing on the `orderSuccess` flow, URL handling, and user authentication post-checkout, with a noticeable shift in strategy regarding the post-order thank you page navigation.

# Activity Summary for 11/11/2025

## 11:04:12
The `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` file underwent several updates on 10/11/2025. This file defines a `ProductSearch` React component, likely used for adding products or collections to a discount or offer.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **10/11/2025, 15:15:21**: This timestamp represents an initial state or an earlier version of the component with features like:
    *   Props for controlling buttons: `hideButton`, `buttonText`, `buttonInputProps`, `btnSearch`.
    *   Imports included `Button` and `DeleteOutlined` from `gokwik-ui-kit`.
    *   Product display logic included `product.product_thumbnail_url || product.thumbnail_url || ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage` and `product.product_name || product.name` for fallback display.
    *   Product removal used `DeleteOutlined`.
    *   The `handleQuantityChange` function for collections would set the quantity directly.
    *   The `handleCloseAllInput` function would unconditionally set `quantity: 0` for all collections.

*   **10/11/2025, 18:52:50**: Significant changes were introduced at this timestamp:
    *   **Component Simplification**: Props related to buttons (`hideButton`, `buttonText`, `buttonInputProps`, `btnSearch`) were removed from the `ProductSearch` component, implying a reduction in its direct control over button rendering.
    *   **UI Library Imports Refinement**: The `Button` and `DeleteOutlined` components were removed from the `gokwik-ui-kit` imports, reflecting the removal of button-related props and a change in the product removal icon.
    *   **Product Display Logic Update**: The fallback logic for product images and names was slightly simplified, removing `product.thumbnail_url` and `product.name` fallbacks in the displayed product list.
    *   **Icon Change**: The icon for removing a selected product changed from `DeleteOutlined` to `CloseOutlined`.
    *   **Conditional Quantity Update**: The `handleQuantityChange` function was updated to conditionally apply the `quantity: newQuantityValue` to the `onAdd` action, specifically when `collectionSpecificData?.collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity` is true and `newQuantityValue` is greater than 0.

*   **10/11/2025, 18:56:10**: A minor but targeted adjustment was made to the `handleCloseAllInput` function:
    *   **Conditional Quantity Reset**: The logic for resetting collection quantities was modified. Instead of unconditionally setting `quantity: 0` for all collections, it now conditionally applies `{quantity: 0}` only if `collectionSpecificData?.collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity` is true. This ensures quantities are only reset when specific collection quantity management is active.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The component consistently handles both "products" and "collections" as `searchType`.
*   It utilizes infinite scrolling (`useIntersectionObserver`) for fetching more items.
*   A debounced search input (`useEffect` with `setTimeout`) is used to optimize API calls.
*   State management is handled via `useState` and `useRef` hooks.
*   Conditional rendering is prevalent based on props like `hideSearch`, `hideSearchInput`, `isAgentLed`, and `collectionSpecificData`.
*   The component frequently interacts with an API (`fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`) to retrieve data.
*   There's a clear distinction in how products (which can be collated by `product_id` and have variants) and collections are managed and displayed.
*   Quantity management, particularly for collections, is a recurring theme, with specific logic around `collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity`.

The provided log includes changes for several files, but files identified as potentially storing sensitive keys or environment configurations will not be summarized as per instructions. This includes `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`. The `EnvironmentService.ts` file defines various base URLs for different environments and also hardcoded session tokens (`SANDBOXKWIKSESSIONTOKEN`, `KWIKSESSIONTOKEN`, `QAKWIKSESSIONTOKEN`). The `merchant.html` file contains `window.merchantInfo` with sensitive identifiers like `mid` and `fbpixel`, and HTML attributes such as `data-appsecret`.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**
This Svelte component, responsible for handling discount-related logic, was logged multiple times between 10/11/2025, 22:29:52 and 10/11/2025, 22:40:07. Across all these timestamps, the code content remained identical. The component imports numerous common and order-specific stores (e.g., `CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`) and services (e.g., `ForeignAnalytics`, `EventService`, `Discounts.service`, `MerchantAPI`, `Helper.service`, `WalletCredits.service`, `ShippingDiscount.service`, `GiftCard.service`, `TwidPay.service`) to manage various discount types (automatic, stacked, one-click, gift cards, loyalty points, partner acquisition offers like CredPay, TwidPay, Gyftr, Shopify store credit) and their application/removal. It also dynamically builds a list of `allAppliedOffers` based on `appliedAutomaticDiscounts`, `stackedDiscountConfig`, and `partnerAcquisitionOffer`. Key states like `discountCouponApplied`, `creditsApplied`, `storeCreditAvailable`, `cartAutoDiscount`, and `allowDiscountApplication` are managed within the component. Despite multiple entries in the log, no functional changes were introduced in this file during the recorded period.

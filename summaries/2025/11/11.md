# Activity Summary for 11/11/2025

## 11:04:12
The `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` file underwent several updates on 10/11/2025. This file defines a `ProductSearch` React component, likely used for adding products or collections to a discount or offer.

**Key Changes and Timestamps:**

*   **10/11/2025, 15:15:21**: This timestamp represents an initial state or an earlier version of the component with features like:
    *   Props for controlling buttons: `hideButton`, `buttonText`, `buttonInputProps`, `btnSearch`.
    *   Imports included `Button` and `DeleteOutlined` from `gokwik-ui-kit`.
    *   Product display logic included `product.product_thumbnail_url || product.thumbnail_url || ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage` and `product.product_name || product.name` for fallback display.
    *   Product removal used `DeleteOutlined`.
    *   The `handleQuantityChange` function for collections would set the quantity directly.
    *   The `handleCloseAllInput` function would unconditionally set `quantity: 0` for all collections.

*   **10/11/2025, 18:52:50**: Significant changes were introduced at this timestamp:
    *   **Component Simplification**: Props related to buttons (`hideButton`, `buttonText`, `buttonInputProps`, `btnSearch`) were removed from the `ProductSearch` component, implying a reduction in its direct control over button rendering.
    *   **UI Library Imports Refinement**: The `Button` and `DeleteOutlined` components were removed from the `gokwik-ui-kit` imports, reflecting the removal of button-related props and a change in the product removal icon.
    *   **Product Display Logic Update**: The fallback logic for product images and names was slightly simplified, removing `product.thumbnail_url` and `product.name` fallbacks in the displayed product list.
    *   **Icon Change**: The icon for removing a selected product changed from `DeleteOutlined` to `CloseOutlined`.
    *   **Conditional Quantity Update**: The `handleQuantityChange` function was updated to conditionally apply the `quantity: newQuantityValue` to the `onAdd` action, specifically when `collectionSpecificData?.collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity` is true and `newQuantityValue` is greater than 0.

*   **10/11/2025, 18:56:10**: A minor but targeted adjustment was made to the `handleCloseAllInput` function:
    *   **Conditional Quantity Reset**: The logic for resetting collection quantities was modified. Instead of unconditionally setting `quantity: 0` for all collections, it now conditionally applies `{quantity: 0}` only if `collectionSpecificData?.collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity` is true. This ensures quantities are only reset when specific collection quantity management is active.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The component consistently handles both "products" and "collections" as `searchType`.
*   It utilizes infinite scrolling (`useIntersectionObserver`) for fetching more items.
*   A debounced search input (`useEffect` with `setTimeout`) is used to optimize API calls.
*   State management is handled via `useState` and `useRef` hooks.
*   Conditional rendering is prevalent based on props like `hideSearch`, `hideSearchInput`, `isAgentLed`, and `collectionSpecificData`.
*   The component frequently interacts with an API (`fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`) to retrieve data.
*   There's a clear distinction in how products (which can be collated by `product_id` and have variants) and collections are managed and displayed.
*   Quantity management, particularly for collections, is a recurring theme, with specific logic around `collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity`.

The provided log includes changes for several files, but files identified as potentially storing sensitive keys or environment configurations will not be summarized as per instructions. This includes `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`. The `EnvironmentService.ts` file defines various base URLs for different environments and also hardcoded session tokens (`SANDBOXKWIKSESSIONTOKEN`, `KWIKSESSIONTOKEN`, `QAKWIKSESSIONTOKEN`). The `merchant.html` file contains `window.merchantInfo` with sensitive identifiers like `mid` and `fbpixel`, and HTML attributes such as `data-appsecret`.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**
This Svelte component, responsible for handling discount-related logic, was logged multiple times between 10/11/2025, 22:29:52 and 10/11/2025, 22:40:07. Across all these timestamps, the code content remained identical. The component imports numerous common and order-specific stores (e.g., `CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`) and services (e.g., `ForeignAnalytics`, `EventService`, `Discounts.service`, `MerchantAPI`, `Helper.service`, `WalletCredits.service`, `ShippingDiscount.service`, `GiftCard.service`, `TwidPay.service`) to manage various discount types (automatic, stacked, one-click, gift cards, loyalty points, partner acquisition offers like CredPay, TwidPay, Gyftr, Shopify store credit) and their application/removal. It also dynamically builds a list of `allAppliedOffers` based on `appliedAutomaticDiscounts`, `stackedDiscountConfig`, and `partnerAcquisitionOffer`. Key states like `discountCouponApplied`, `creditsApplied`, `storeCreditAvailable`, `cartAutoDiscount`, and `allowDiscountApplication` are managed within the component. Despite multiple entries in the log, no functional changes were introduced in this file during the recorded period.

The file `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` underwent several iterative changes, primarily focusing on the component's user interface, prop management, and logic for handling product and collection quantities.

At **10/11/2025, 15:15:21**, the `ProductSearch` component was defined with props such as `hideButton`, `buttonText`, `buttonInputProps`, and `btnSearch` to control its visibility and text. It imported `Button` and `DeleteOutlined` from `gokwik-ui-kit`. The UI included a general "Add" button and a specific "Select products/collections" button. When displaying added products, a `DeleteOutlined` icon was used for removal. The `handleCloseAllInput` function, used for collections, unconditionally set all collection quantities to zero.

By **10/11/2025, 18:52:50**, significant UI simplification occurred. The `hideButton`, `buttonText`, `buttonInputProps`, and `btnSearch` props, along with their corresponding `Button` components and the `DeleteOutlined` import, were removed from the component. Instead of explicit buttons, the modal for searching is now triggered directly by clicking on the read-only search input field. For product removal, the `DeleteOutlined` icon was replaced with `CloseOutlined`. The `handleQuantityChange` function was updated to conditionally apply the `quantity: newQuantityValue` property only if `collectionSpecificData?.collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity` is true and the `newQuantityValue` is greater than zero, making the quantity update logic more precise for collections with minimum purchase requirements.

A final refinement at **10/11/2025, 18:56:10** adjusted the `handleCloseAllInput` function. Previously, this function would reset all collection quantities to 0. It now applies `{quantity: 0}` conditionally, only if `collectionSpecificData?.collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity` is enabled. This ensures that collection quantities are only reset when the specific minimum purchase quantity feature is active, preventing unintended data loss for other types of collections.

Across these changes, the component consistently utilizes `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` for data retrieval, `useAppDispatch` and `useIntersectionObserver` for state management and infinite scrolling, and implements a debounced search mechanism for performance. There's a clear pattern of enhancing conditional logic, especially around `collectionSpecificData`, to provide more granular control and flexibility for different discount configurations.

For `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, a summary is not generated as it relates to environment configuration and potentially sensitive data.

The `public/merchant.html` file, observed at `10/11/2025, 14:45:43` and `10/11/2025, 22:25:52`, appears to be a static HTML page for testing merchant integration with the Gokwik checkout SDK.
*   **Initial State (14:45:43):** It includes a custom `gokwikSdk` JavaScript IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) for managing checkout initialization, events, and a `hideButton` function. This SDK dynamically loads `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js` for local development. The page also sets and retrieves cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) and contains a `window.merchantInfo` object for local testing, hardcoding the `environment` to 'local' and including various commented-out merchant IDs (`mid`). It displays a "click me" button with `data-mid`, `data-appid`, and `data-appsecret` attributes for checkout initiation. A Privy widget integration is also present.
*   **Later Update (22:25:52):** The only discernible change is a minor update within the commented-out `mid` values in the `window.merchantInfo` object, specifically changing a `qa mid` from `'19g6il4y1bh06'` to `'12wyqc2guqmkrw6406j'`. No functional code changes were introduced at this later timestamp.

The `src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file shows multiple logs between `10/11/2025, 22:29:52` and `10/11/2025, 22:40:07`. Across all these timestamps, the file content remains functionally identical. This indicates a series of saves likely for minor non-functional changes (e.g., whitespace, comments) or frequent incremental saves during development/debugging rather than substantial code alterations.
*   **File Specifics:** This Svelte component is highly complex, centralizing the management of discounts and offers within the checkout flow. It imports numerous stores (`CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`) and services for analytics, events, discount logic, wallet credits, shipping discounts, gift cards, and payment options.
*   **Key Functionality:** It dynamically displays and manages various discount types, including automatic, stacked, manual coupon inputs, gift cards, loyalty programs, and partner acquisition offers (e.g., Cred).
    *   It uses Svelte's reactive declarations (`$:`) to update `loyaltyDisplayName` and `allAppliedOffers`, which aggregates discounts from different sources (automatic, stacked, manual, partner offers).
    *   The `onMount` lifecycle hook subscribes to several stores to configure discount behavior based on merchant custom settings (e.g., `disable_discount_with_credits`, `enable_extra_automatic_discounts`) and to process available offers.
    *   The component is responsible for enabling/disabling discount application based on stacking rules and the number of discounts clubbed. It also tracks the application status of one-click coupons.

The `src/common/services/ApiConfig.ts` file, logged at `10/11/2025, 22:52:36`, defines a comprehensive set of API endpoints for the Gokwik platform.
*   **File Specifics:** It exports a single `APIConfig` object, categorizing API paths by functional area such as `initial calls`, `cart`, `login`, `address`, `shipping`, `payment` (further broken down into `cards`, `cardsEmi`, `netBanking`, `upi`, `bnpl`, `otpBnpl`, `otpWallet`), `discount`, `giftCard`, `rewards`, `create`, `twidPay`, `experiments`, `kp`, `gst`, `shopify_credits`, `thankyou`, `checkoutLink`, `selectionGifts`, and `proxyService`.
*   **Key Endpoints:** Most endpoints are strings representing API paths, but some, like those for `bnpl` (`verifyOtp`, `resendOtp`, `uploadDocument`, `initiateAgreement`, `agreementStatus`, `initiateMandate`), are functions that construct the URL dynamically based on parameters such as `orderId` and `txnId`.
*   **Structure:** The configuration uses `/v1/`, `/v2/`, `/v3/`, and `/v4/` prefixes within the paths, indicating API versioning.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**
*   **Checkout-centric Development:** The changes consistently focus on features related to an e-commerce checkout process, including merchant integration, discount application, and API interactions.
*   **Environment Awareness:** Although the environment service itself is skipped, the presence of `window.merchantInfo?.environment` in `merchant.html` and explicit configuration options in `Discounts.svelte` (e.g., `custom_config`) suggests a system designed for multiple deployment environments.
*   **Frequent Iteration:** The numerous, nearly identical log entries for `Discounts.svelte` and `EnvironmentService.ts` within short timeframes point to a development pattern of frequent saves, potentially indicating active development or debugging sessions.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The codebase shows signs of modular design, separating API configurations (`ApiConfig.ts`) from UI components (`Discounts.svelte`) and environment-specific logic (`EnvironmentService.ts`), with extensive use of Svelte stores for state management.
*   **Rich Discount System:** The `Discounts.svelte` component highlights a sophisticated discount and offer management system, accommodating various promotional types and complex application rules (e.g., stacking limits, loyalty program integration).

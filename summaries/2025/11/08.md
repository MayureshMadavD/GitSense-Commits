# Activity Summary for 08/11/2025

The development log for the `mint-dashboard` project reveals changes across Docker configuration and an email sending API endpoint.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile:**
    *   Between 28/10/2025 and 29/10/2025, the Dockerfile maintained a consistent structure for building a Node.js application (using `node:20-alpine`, setting work directory to `/app`, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json`, installing dependencies, copying source, generating Prisma schema, building the app, exposing port 3000, and starting the application).
    *   A significant update occurred on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command changed from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This removes the `--force` flag, indicating a shift towards stricter dependency management.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts:**
    *   All changes occurred on 03/11/2025.
    *   The initial version at 17:38:44 established an API route for saving PNG report data (daily/weekly) via a POST request and functions (`sendDailyReport`, `sendWeeklyReport`, `sendEmailForReport`) for sending these reports via Nodemailer. It included commented-out `node-cron` schedules for daily and weekly report triggers. The email sender was set to `integration-noreply@gokwik.co`.
    *   At 17:39:41, a minor update changed the sender email address in `sendEmailForReport` from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
    *   By 18:12:32, the `sendEmailForReport` function was further modified to include logging of the `transporter.sendMail` response, specifically `console.log(res)`, which helps in debugging email sending issues.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The project consistently uses Node.js 20 Alpine for Dockerization.
*   Prisma schema generation (`npx prisma generate`) is an integral step in the build process.
*   The `sendemail/route.ts` file is primarily focused on handling image-based report data, saving it, and sending it out as daily or weekly email reports using Nodemailer.
*   There's a clear emphasis on cron-based scheduling for report delivery, although the actual cron schedules were commented out in the provided logs.
*   The codebase frequently interacts with a backend for querying and deleting report data (`pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, `deletepngReportData`).
*   Timestamps show a cluster of activity on 28th-29th October (Dockerfile changes) and another cluster on 3rd November (email functionality changes), suggesting focused development sprints.

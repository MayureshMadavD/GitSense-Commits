# Activity Summary for 03/11/2025

## 11:20:12
The changes primarily involve a single file, `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

Between 28/10/2025 and 29/10/2025, the Dockerfile consistently defines a build process for a Node.js application using the `node:20-alpine` base image. Key steps across all versions include:
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` for SSL support.
*   Copying `package*.json` files first for better caching.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application with `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port 3000.
*   Starting the application with `npm start`.

A significant functional change occurred on `29/10/2025, 23:35:21`. In this update, the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. The `-f` (force) flag, which forces `npm install` to fetch remote resources even if a local cache exists, was removed. All other steps and configurations within the Dockerfile remained consistent across the logged changes. The earlier entries on `28/10/2025` at `12:27:10`, `12:27:41`, and `12:29:42` all contained the `npm install -f` command and were otherwise identical.

## 11:20:47
The provided log details a series of code changes primarily focused on enhancing shipping settings, UI customization for the login page, and bulk discount management within a checkout dashboard application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**:
    *   **Initial Setup & Form Refinements (29/10/2025, 17:11:01 - 29/10/2025, 17:32:12)**: This component, responsible for product-based shipping rules, underwent significant changes to its `handleFormSubmit` function. Initially, the save configuration logic was commented out. Later, logic was introduced to handle updates to existing rules by tracking `previousShippingId` and conditionally deleting old rules, alongside setting default values for `price_multiplier` and `combine_with_weight_based`. Crucially, the actual `saveConfig` API call and UI reset actions were uncommented on **29/10/2025, 17:30:43**, enabling the core functionality.
    *   **Debugging & Rule Management (30/10/2025, 10:35:02 - 31/10/2025, 23:49:18)**: Further iterations involved adding and removing `console.log` statements and temporarily commenting out save operations, indicating active debugging. A key update on **31/10/2025, 23:09:53** changed how product-based rules are handled during an update, moving from overwriting to appending them to an existing array (`[...(targetedShipping?.product_based_rules || []), formValues]`). Subsequent changes, particularly on **31/10/2025, 23:40:49**, refined the logic for deleting rules associated with a `previousShippingId`, attempting to remove rules based on their count and name, although the array manipulation for deletion itself showed some iterative corrections. The save functionality was re-enabled on **31/10/2025, 23:47:40**.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**:
    *   **Core Logic Implementation (29/10/2025, 17:17:21)**: This file was created to encapsulate the data processing and form field definitions for product-based shipping. It handles transforming shipping data, managing selected product/collection items, and generating dynamic options for mapping shipping IDs. It introduced `previousShippingId` using `useState` on **29/10/2025, 17:22:56**, vital for update operations in `productBasaedShipping.tsx`.
    *   **Option Selection Adjustment (31/10/2025, 23:05:43)**: The logic that disabled already used shipping IDs in the `selectedOptions` was commented out, meaning all shipping IDs became selectable, potentially allowing multiple rules to map to the same ID.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**:
    *   **State Structure Refinement (29/10/2025, 18:04:43 - 29/10/2025, 18:27:17)**: A typo (`is_ isContinueButtonVisible`) was corrected, and new boolean flags were introduced in the `login_data` slice of the Redux store: `is_consent_auto_select: true` on **29/10/2025, 18:05:03** and a rename of `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible: false` on **29/10/2025, 18:27:17**.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**:
    *   **UI Restructuring & Feature Integration (29/10/2025, 18:09:05 - 29/10/2025, 18:23:38)**: This page underwent a major refactoring to centralize its form elements. Components for "Primary Button" CTA text and "Consent Section" were moved from direct JSX into a dynamic `fields` array, leveraging a `RenderField` component. Each element from this array was then rendered within its own `Card`.
    *   **Consent & CTA Enhancements (29/10/2025, 18:27:00 - 29/10/2025, 18:58:39)**: The `is_consent_required` property and its references were updated to `isConsentVisible`, aligning with the Redux store change. On **29/10/2025, 18:39:37**, the `Consent Section` was further enhanced with a new `is_consent_auto_select` switch and the integration of `BannerComponentRendrer` for consent text editing. Finally, on **29/10/2025, 18:58:39**, validation was added to ensure the primary button text is not empty if the button is visible.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**:
    *   **Stable Preview Component (29/10/2025, 18:48:04)**: This component provides a mobile preview of the checkout UI, dynamically displaying content based on active tabs and Redux state. No significant functional code changes occurred, indicating its stable role as a visualization tool.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**:
    *   **Integrations Form Setup (29/10/2025, 21:03:41)**: This component was introduced to render various integration forms, particularly for loyalty programs. It defines a rich set of configurable fields for loyalty, including options for COD with loyalty, stacking discounts, auto-applying credits, custom display names, showing earned points, and sales channel control, all accompanied by helpful tooltips and alerts.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**:
    *   **Dynamic Tab Management (30/10/2025, 10:49:18)**: The "Product Based Shipping" tab was made to appear conditionally, based on the `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` setting, allowing for feature toggling.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**:
    *   **Bulk Discount Creation Logic (30/10/2025, 17:52:43)**: This component enables the creation of bulk discount codes via random generation or CSV upload. It includes robust validation for various input fields (title, expiry, code length, prefix/suffix).
    *   **Upload Logic Adjustment (30/10/2025, 18:19:56 - 30/10/2025, 18:25:34)**: The `includeUserIdHeader` parameter for `makeAWSPutCall` was changed to `false` on **30/10/2025, 18:19:56**. Subsequently, the actual `makeAWSPutCall` was commented out in the `uploadDiscountCSV` function, suggesting a temporary halt or alternative handling for the direct AWS upload.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**:
    *   **API Data Mapping (30/10/2025, 18:29:20)**: This file outlines the data transformation logic for discount API calls. It defines functions to map customer eligibility, assign match types, standardize Shopify collection/product IDs, and structure discount setup payloads, serving as a critical layer between UI input and API requests.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React Hooks for State Management**: `useState` and `useEffect` are extensively used across multiple components for managing local component state and side effects.
*   **Ant Design Forms**: The application heavily relies on `gokwik-ui-kit`'s `Form` component for structured data input, including `Form.useForm()` and `Form.useWatch()` for form control and real-time value monitoring.
*   **Conditional UI Rendering**: Many features, such as tabs, specific input fields, and descriptions, are rendered conditionally based on other form values or configuration settings, enabling dynamic user interfaces.
*   **Validation and User Feedback**: `message.error` is frequently used to provide immediate feedback to users regarding invalid inputs or failed operations, improving user experience.
*   **API Integration Patterns**: Common patterns for interacting with backend services, including generating pre-signed URLs for file uploads (`makeAWSCutCall`) and making authenticated API calls (`makeAPICall`), are observed.
*   **Data Transformation**: Functions are consistently used to transform data between the UI representation and the API payload format, particularly for complex structures like shipping rules, product/collection IDs, and discount configurations.
*   **Debugging Practices**: The presence and removal of `console.log` statements and commented-out code blocks indicate an iterative development and debugging process for complex features.

## 12:20:17
The provided log primarily details changes within a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

Across the four logged entries, the `Dockerfile` maintained a consistent structure and set of instructions, indicating a stable build process for a Node.js application. The recurring elements include:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` via `apk add --no-cache`.

*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema using `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application with `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port `3000`.
*   Starting the application with `npm start`.

A significant change occurred on **29/10/2025 at 23:35:21**. In this update, the dependency installation command within the `Dockerfile` was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This change removes the `-f` (force) flag from the npm install command, suggesting a shift to standard dependency installation behavior rather than forcing it, which might affect how packages are resolved or updated.

Prior to this change, on **28/10/2025**, three identical entries for the `Dockerfile` were logged at **12:27:10**, **12:27:41**, and **12:29:42**, all containing the `RUN npm install -f` instruction. This indicates multiple saves or minor, non-content-altering operations on the same file within a short period before the actual code modification.

## 12:20:46
`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx` saw extensive iteration, particularly in its `handleFormSubmit` function. Initially, around **29/10/2025, 17:11:50**, it set up product-based shipping rules with save logic commented out. Significant changes at **29/10/2025, 17:23:01** involved retrieving a `previousShippingId` from a helper function, indicating the start of an editing feature. The save functionality was fully enabled at **29/10/2025, 17:30:43**, following various debugging steps. A major functional shift at **31/10/2025, 23:09:53** changed the rule-saving mechanism from replacing to appending `product_based_rules`, allowing multiple rules per shipping ID. Subsequent updates until **01/11/2025, 12:04:22** involved repeated debugging and refinement of the logic for deleting specific rules during an edit, including adding `.trim()` for name comparisons.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` was updated at **29/10/2025, 17:22:56** to introduce `previousShippingId` (initially `let`, then a `useState` at **29/10/2025, 17:29:02**), supporting the editing flow in `productBasaedShipping.tsx`. At **31/10/2025, 23:05:43**, the `disabled` property logic for `selectedOptions` was commented out, enabling all options in the dropdown regardless of their current usage.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts` received an update at **29/10/2025, 18:05:03** to correct a typo from `is_ isContinueButtonVisible` to `isContinueButtonVisible` and introduced `is_consent_auto_select: true`. At **29/10/2025, 18:27:17**, it renamed `is_consent_required` to `isConsentVisible` within the `login_data` state.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx` underwent several UI refactorings between **29/10/2025, 18:17:05** and **29/10/2025, 18:26:23** to centralize components like "Banner", "Primary Button", and "Consent Section" into a `fields` array, leveraging a `RenderField` utility. The "Consent Section" was further evolved at **29/10/2025, 18:39:37** to utilize a `BannerComponentRendrer` for content rendering. A new "Auto-select offers and updates consent box on checkout" feature (`is_consent_auto_select`) was integrated into the "Consent Section" at **29/10/2025, 18:44:05**, with its initial value set to `true` at **29/10/2025, 18:46:01**. A validation rule to prevent empty CTA text was added at **29/10/2025, 18:58:39**.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx` was updated at **30/10/2025, 10:49:18** to conditionally render the "Product Based Shipping" tab, making it visible only if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is enabled.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx` received updates to its `uploadDiscountCSV` function. At **30/10/2025, 18:19:56**, the file upload mechanism was changed from a direct `fetch` call to `makeAWSPutCall`, with the `includeUserIdHeader` property being toggled from `true` to `false` and back to `true` at **30/10/2025, 18:30:51**. Intermediate commits included temporarily commenting out upload logic and adding `console.log` statements for debugging.

The files `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`, and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` mainly served as points of reference or contained minor non-functional re-saves within the provided log, with no significant code changes detailed in their entries. `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` was added in the log at **03/11/2025, 11:41:24**, outlining its initial structure for managing automatic free gift settings.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**
*   **Iterative Refinement and Debugging**: A consistent pattern of small, frequent changes, often involving `console.log` or temporary commenting/uncommenting of code, suggests active and iterative development with a focus on debugging, particularly for complex logic related to data saving, deletion, and UI rendering.

## 13:21:17
**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**: This file, dealing with product-based shipping rules, saw significant iterative development. Initially, it established the UI for adding and viewing rules. Subsequent updates primarily focused on refining the `handleFormSubmit` logic, specifically how `previousShippingId` is used to manage existing rules during edits. The update process for `product_based_rules` changed from overwriting to appending, suggesting support for multiple rules per shipping ID. Numerous `console.log` statements were added and removed, indicating active debugging during these changes. The logic for deleting specific product-based rules within an array also went through several modifications, some of which introduced or corrected array manipulation methods.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**: This utility file, which processes shipping data, was updated to make `previousShippingId` a stateful variable (`useState`) for persistence. Notably, the logic to disable already-used shipping IDs in the `selectedOptions` memoized computation was commented out, potentially to allow more flexible configuration or for testing purposes.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**: This Redux slice definition was updated to correct a typo in the `login_data` initial state (`is_ isContinueButtonVisible` to `isContinueButtonVisible`) and to introduce `is_consent_auto_select: true`. Later, `is_consent_required` was renamed to `isConsentVisible`, reflecting a clearer intention for the field.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**: This login page customization component underwent extensive refactoring. UI elements for "Banner," "Primary Button," and "Consent Section" were progressively moved into a dynamic `fields` array for consistent rendering using `RenderField` within `Card` components. The "Consent Section" specifically transitioned from a generic `RenderEditorFunction` to a dedicated `BannerComponentRendrer` and gained a new `is_consent_auto_select` switch, defaulting to `true`. A new validation check was added to ensure the "Continue" button text is not empty if the button is visible.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**: A new `MobileStepUI` component was introduced. This component provides a mobile-like preview of the checkout UI, dynamically adjusting its display based on the active tab (e.g., brand, login, payments, coupons) and Redux-managed customization data.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**: This file saw the addition of a comprehensive `loyaltyInputs` array. This new set of form fields enables detailed configuration of loyalty programs within the application, including options for Cash on Delivery, discount stacking, auto-application, custom display names, earned points display, calculation rules, and sales channel control, all accompanied by descriptive tooltips.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**: This template file for UI configuration showed repeated changes to the `systemjs-importmap` section within the `isLocal` environment. The URLs for various `@gokwik` modules (e.g., `utilities`, `checkout`, `payment`) were frequently adjusted, oscillating between `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`, `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`, and `qa.gokwik.in`, often pointing `@gokwik/checkout` to `//localhost:9002/gokwik-checkout.js`. This suggests ongoing configuration for local development and testing across different staging environments.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**: This component for shipping services introduced conditional rendering for the "Product Based Shipping" tab, making its visibility dependent on `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**: This component was added to configure standard shipping methods, including price, min/max order values, advanced conditions, customer segmentation, and the ability to upload pincode and cohort CSV files with validation.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**: This file introduced a component for creating bulk discount codes. It supports generating random codes or uploading them via a ZIP of CSV files. The logic for uploading CSVs to AWS S3 (`makeAWSPutCall`) was repeatedly enabled, then temporarily commented out for debugging/testing, and re-enabled, with the `includeUserIdHeader` specifically set to `true`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**: This file was added with extensive API mapping logic for discount configurations.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
    *   **Rule Handling and Saving:** Initial changes (29/10/2025, 17:11:50) outlined the component structure for product-based shipping rules, including form submission logic. Key updates involved how `product_based_rules` are handled: initially overwriting (`targetedShipping.product_based_rules = [formValues]`), then changed to *appending* rules (`...[targetedShipping?.product_based_rules || [], formValues]`) (31/10/2025, 23:09:53). This is a significant functional shift from single rule per shipping ID to multiple rules.
    *   **Editing Logic:** Introduced logic to remove `product_based_rules` associated with a `previousShippingId` when a rule is being edited, to prevent conflicts or duplicates if a rule's mapped shipping ID changes (29/10/2025, 17:25:08). This deletion logic was progressively refined over several commits (31/10/2025, 23:40:49 to 01/11/2025, 12:01:32), attempting to correctly delete either the entire `product_based_rules` array if it contains only one rule, or a specific matching rule within the array. However, the use of `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]` for array elements is a recurring problematic pattern, as it creates sparse arrays rather than removing elements.
    *   **Form Submission:** The actual `saveConfig` API call and UI resets (`setItemsData`, `setModalOpen`, `form.resetFields`) were initially commented out for debugging/development and later uncommented to enable full functionality (29/10/2025, 17:30:43), then commented out again (31/10/2025, 23:19:31), and re-enabled (31/10/2025, 23:47:40).
    *   **Minor Refinements:** Added conditional deletion of `shipping_id` (31/10/2025, 23:10:24) and improved string comparison for rule names by adding `.trim()` (01/11/2025, 12:01:32).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
    *   **`previousShippingId` Management:** The `previousShippingId` variable was initially a local `let` variable (29/10/2025, 17:22:56) and then correctly converted to a `useState` hook, allowing it to maintain state across renders (29/10/2025, 17:29:02).
    *   **Dropdown Logic:** The `disabled` property for `selectedOptions` in the shipping ID dropdown was commented out (31/10/2025, 23:05:43), which removes the functionality that prevented users from selecting an already mapped shipping ID.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   **State Refinement:** Corrected a typo from `is_ isContinueButtonVisible` to `isContinueButtonVisible` and introduced a new `is_consent_auto_select` boolean property in the `login_data` initialState (29/10/2025, 18:05:03). Also, `is_consent_required` was renamed to `isConsentVisible` (29/10/2025, 18:27:17).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`**
    *   **UI Refactoring:** This file saw extensive refactoring to integrate UI elements like "Primary Button" and "Consent Section" into a `fields` array rendered by a generic `RenderField` component (29/10/2025, 18:17:05 to 29/10/2025, 18:26:23). Initially, there was duplication where elements were rendered both directly and via `RenderField`, but eventually the direct JSX was removed.
    *   **New Consent Feature:** Added a new switch for `is_consent_auto_select` within the "Consent Section" (29/10/2025, 18:44:05), allowing the consent box to be pre-selected.
    *   **Validation:** New validation was added to `handleFormSubmit` to prevent empty banner or consent text (29/10/2025, 18:09:05) and to ensure the primary button text is not empty if the button is visible (29/10/2025, 18:58:39).
    *   **Dynamic Rendering:** Integrated `BannerComponentRendrer` for the consent text when `isConsentVisible` is true (29/10/2025, 18:39:37), making the display more dynamic.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **Preview Functionality:** This new component (29/10/2025, 18:48:04) provides a mobile preview of UI customizations across different checkout steps (brand, login, payments, checkout elements, address, coupons). It dynamically displays banners, coupon inputs, and progress indicators based on the active tab and configuration data.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`**
    *   **New Form Elements:** Introduced new `eddAlerts` and `pincodeAlerts` for contextual information with navigation links (29/10/2025, 21:03:41).
    *   **Loyalty Program Integration:** Added comprehensive `loyaltyInputs` form fields for configuring loyalty points, including options for COD, discount stacking, auto-application, custom display names, earned points calculation, and sales channel control.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **Conditional Tabs:** The "Product Based Shipping" tab was made conditional, appearing only if `merchantConfig?.config?.custom_config?.shipping_service` is enabled (30/10/2025, 10:49:18).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`**
    *   **Pincode Upload:** Added `Inputs` for CSV file uploads specifically for pincode lists, including client-side validation for file type and content format (6-digit numbers, various delimiters) (30/10/2025, 10:53:28). This enables merchants to define shipping serviceability by uploading CSVs of pincodes.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **Bulk Discount Creation:** Introduced a component to create bulk discount codes, supporting both random code generation and CSV file uploads (30/10/2025, 17:52:43).
    *   **Upload Mechanism:** Implemented `uploadDiscountCSV` to handle generating presigned S3 URLs and uploading ZIP files, including temporary disabling/re-enabling of the actual upload call for development (30/10/2025, 18:19:56 to 30/10/2025, 18:26:49).
    *   **Validation & Formulas:** Includes validation for discount set titles, expiry dates, code generation feasibility (`codeGenerationFormula`), and regex patterns for prefixes/suffixes.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   **API Data Mapping:** This file defines helper functions for mapping various discount configurations to API payloads, including customer eligibility, matching types, and detailed product/collection mappings for specific discount types (30/10/2025, 18:29:20). It handles complex logic for comparing and updating product/variant lists when modifying discounts.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **29/10/2025, 17:11:50 - 17:32:12:** Initial development and refinement of product-based shipping rule form and submission logic in `productBasaedShipping.tsx` and its utility `shippingBasedData.tsx`, including state management for `previousShippingId` and enabling `saveConfig`.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:04:43 - 18:05:03:** Correction and addition of `login_data` properties in Redux store `customize-ui/index.ts`.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:09:05 - 18:58:39:** Extensive refactoring, UI element integration into generic `RenderField`, new `is_consent_auto_select` feature, and validation improvements in `loginPage.tsx`.
*   **29/10/2025, 18:48:04:** Introduction of `mobilePage.tsx` for mobile UI previews.
*   **29/10/2025, 21:03:41:** Significant additions to `formRender.tsx` for new alerts and comprehensive loyalty program configuration.
*   **30/10/2025, 10:49:18:** Made "Product Based Shipping" tab conditional in `shippingBasedService.tsx`.
*   **30/10/2025, 10:53:28:** Added pincode CSV upload functionality in `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`.
*   **30/10/2025, 17:52:43 - 18:26:49:** Initial development and refinement of bulk discount creation and file upload mechanisms in `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`.
*   **30/10/2025, 18:29:20:** Introduction of detailed discount mapping and product/collection handling logic in `discounts/api.ts`.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:09:53:** Major functional change in `productBasaedShipping.tsx` to append new rules instead of overwriting existing ones for a shipping ID. This change, along with the problematic deletion logic, saw iterative updates until 01/11/2025, 12:04:22.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Iterative Refinement and Debugging:** Many files show a pattern of initial implementation followed by minor adjustments, console logs, or commenting/uncommenting code blocks. This is particularly evident in `productBasaedShipping.tsx` and `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, suggesting active development and debugging cycles.
2.  **UI Component Refactoring:** There's a recurring pattern, especially in `loginPage.tsx`, to consolidate form elements into a reusable `fields` array rendered by a `RenderField` component, aiming for a more modular and data-driven UI.
3.  **State Management:** Extensive use of `useState` and `useForm` hooks for local component state, and `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch` for Redux store interaction (e.g., `customize-ui` and `discounts` stores).
4.  **Conditional Rendering:** Frequent use of conditional rendering (e.g., `if (condition) return ...`, `&&`, `?:`) to display different UI elements or logic paths based on various criteria (e.g., active tabs, switch states, data availability).
5.  **API Interaction:** Components often interact with backend APIs via `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` from `@gokwik/utilities`, often involving presigned URLs for file uploads.
6.  **Form Validation:** Extensive form validation rules are applied using the `Form` component's `rules` property, including custom validators and debounced validation.
7.  **Shipping-Related Configuration:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around managing different types of shipping configurations (product-based, weight-based, discount-based) and their associated rules and UI.
8.  **Consent and Customization:** The `customizeUI` components focus on enabling/disabling UI elements like banners and consent sections, and allowing custom text input.

## 15:20:17
The changes log exclusively tracks modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**: This Dockerfile defines a multi-stage build process for a Node.js application using the `node:20-alpine` base image. It sets `/app` as the working directory, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json`, installs dependencies, copies the entire source code, generates a Prisma schema, builds the application, exposes port `3000`, and starts the application using `npm start`.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **28/10/2025, 12:27:10**: The initial version of the Dockerfile was recorded, setting up the standard build steps.
*   **28/10/2025, 12:27:41** and **28/10/2025, 12:29:42**: These timestamps record the Dockerfile content as identical to the initial entry, likely representing minor saves or re-recordings without substantive code changes.
*   **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**: A key functional change was introduced. The dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This removes the `--force` flag from the `npm install` command, potentially indicating a move towards stricter dependency management or resolution of an issue that previously required forcing installation.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

The core structure and almost all commands within the Dockerfile remain consistent across all entries. This includes:
*   Using `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
*   Setting `WORKDIR /app`.
*   Installing `openssl`.
*   The sequence of `COPY package*.json ./`, `COPY . .`.
*   Executing `npx prisma generate` and `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port `3000`.
*   The `CMD ["npm", "start"]` instruction.

The only substantive change observed throughout the log is the modification of the `npm install` command's flag.

# Activity Summary for 03/11/2025

## 11:20:12
The changes primarily involve a single file, `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

Between 28/10/2025 and 29/10/2025, the Dockerfile consistently defines a build process for a Node.js application using the `node:20-alpine` base image. Key steps across all versions include:
*   Setting the working directory to `/app`.
*   Installing `openssl` for SSL support.
*   Copying `package*.json` files first for better caching.
*   Copying the entire application source code.
*   Generating the Prisma schema with `npx prisma generate`.
*   Building the application with `npm run build`.
*   Exposing port 3000.
*   Starting the application with `npm start`.

A significant functional change occurred on `29/10/2025, 23:35:21`. In this update, the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. The `-f` (force) flag, which forces `npm install` to fetch remote resources even if a local cache exists, was removed. All other steps and configurations within the Dockerfile remained consistent across the logged changes. The earlier entries on `28/10/2025` at `12:27:10`, `12:27:41`, and `12:29:42` all contained the `npm install -f` command and were otherwise identical.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/NewShippingMethod.svelte`**
    *   All entries for this file show identical code, indicating no discernable semantic changes across the provided timestamps.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/Address.svelte`**
    *   **11/11/2025, 23:32:02**: The `on:triggerPincodeCall` event handler in the `AddressInputs` component within `Address.svelte` was updated to correctly assign `event.detail.pincode` to the local `pincode` variable.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentsHeader/PaymentHeaderAddress.svelte`**
    *   **11/11/2025, 23:37:13**: The `changeAddress` function was updated to explicitly clear `store_pincode` and `store_cityState` when invoked.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Environment Configuration Tweaks:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file shows repeated adjustments to the `api_url` for the `local` environment, toggling between different API endpoints, which is typical during active development or debugging.
*   **Address Flow Refinements:** A significant number of changes are concentrated on address management components, including validation logic, clearing state, and optimizing event handling, suggesting ongoing improvements to the address entry and selection experience.
*   **Debugging and Cleanup:** Removal of `console.log` statements and minor fixes in error handling (e.g., `store_pincodeFilled` status) indicate a process of code refinement and stabilization.
*   **Micro-commits/Autosaves:** The high frequency of identical or nearly identical file entries at close timestamps, especially for Svelte components, suggests that the log might capture frequent autosaves or very minor, non-semantic changes like whitespace adjustments.

## 11:21:40
The `productSearch.tsx` file received several updates on **10/11/2025**.
The earliest version (15:15:21) of `productSearch.tsx` defined a flexible component for searching and selecting Shopify products or collections. It handled product quantity, collection-specific quantity rules, infinite scrolling, debounced search, and displayed items with add/remove functionality. Key features included `Button`, `DeleteOutlined`, `InputNumber`, and `EditOutlined` from `gokwik-ui-kit`.
Later that day (18:52:50), the component underwent a significant refactoring:
*   Imports for `Button`, `DeleteOutlined`, `MinusCircleOutlined`, and `PlusCircleOutlined` were removed, indicating a potential abstraction or shift in how these UI elements are handled directly within the component's JSX.
*   Props related to explicit button control (`hideButton`, `buttonText`, `buttonInputProps`, `btnSearch`) were removed from the component's interface.
*   The product display's delete functionality switched from `DeleteOutlined` to `CloseOutlined`.
*   A subsequent change at 18:56:10 modified the `handleCloseAllInput` function to conditionally reset a collection's `quantity` to 0 only if `collectionSpecificData?.collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity` is true, making the reset logic more specific.

The `freeGift.tsx` file, responsible for managing free gift settings, saw a series of rapid changes on **11/11/2025**:
*   The initial version (16:49:03) established the page structure, breadcrumbs, form fields for defining free gift rules, and a table to display them. It heavily utilized `gokwik-ui-kit` components and `Form.useWatch` for reactive form logic. The "Agent led" sales channel option was initially always disabled.
*   A change at 16:50:56 made the "Agent led" sales channel option dynamically disabled, specifically when the `applicationMethod` is not "auto".
*   Minor changes related to `selection_limit`'s `max` property (17:16:25) likely involved whitespace or formatting.
*   A temporary regression was introduced in `handleEdit` at 17:37:33, attempting to index the result of `Array.prototype.find`, which was quickly reverted at 17:38:01.
*   At 17:39:11, `handleEdit` was updated to conditionally filter out 'shopify_agent' from an item's `sales_channels` if the current `applicationMethod` is not 'auto'. This was further refined at 17:41:34 to use the `applicationMethod` *from the item being edited* (`itemToEdit?.applicationMethod`) rather than the component's state, improving data consistency.
*   Form validation was enhanced at 17:42:50 by adding a "Field cannot be empty" message to the `min_value` inputNumber rule.
*   Finally, a significant refactoring at 17:46:56 involved removing direct imports for `Checkbox`, `ColorPicker`, `Input`, `DeleteOutlined`, and `Radio`, as well as `renderFilter`. This suggests these components are now managed via the `RenderField` utility component, centralizing form field rendering logic.

The `index.ejs` file, the main EJS template for the `dashboard-ui-configuration` project, was updated on **11/11/2025, 21:25:30**. This update primarily focused on environment-specific configurations:
*   It defines a Content Security Policy (CSP) for the application.
*   It includes SystemJS import maps to load various `@gokwik` micro-frontends (e.g., `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, `@gokwik/checkout`) with different URLs based on the `isLocal` and `deployedEnv` variables (dev, qa, sandbox, production).
*   For the `production` environment, it specifically added third-party analytics scripts: Microsoft Clarity (if `clarityKey` is present) and New Relic browser monitoring, including its comprehensive configuration details.

The `productBasaedShipping.tsx` file, which handles product-based shipping settings, was updated across **11/11/2025 and 12/11/2025**.
*   The initial version (11/11/2025, 21:55:13) set up a form and table to manage product-based shipping rules, including logic for duplicate name checks, saving configurations via `useMerchantConfigApi`, and using a `Drawer` for rule editing. When the last rule for a shipping item was removed during an edit, its `product_based_rules` property was set to `null`.
*   At 21:56:56, the logic for removing the last rule was changed to set `product_based_rules` to an empty array (`[]`) instead of `null`.
*   This was reverted at 21:57:32, changing the logic back to `delete deleteProductShipping.product_based_rules` (removing the property entirely) when the last rule is deleted.
*   On 12/11/2025, further refinements were made to the `handleFormSubmit` function:
    *   At 10:25:39, `deleteProductShipping.action = 'update'` was added specifically when the last product-based rule is deleted, ensuring the configuration change is registered.
    *   At 10:25:48, this `deleteProductShipping.action = 'update'` was also added to the `else` block (when a rule is filtered out but not the last one), ensuring consistency in marking changes for the `targetedShipping` object.

**Recurring Patterns**:
*   Consistent use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components across different UI files.
*   Extensive use of React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `Form.useWatch`) for state and lifecycle management.
*   Reliance on a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook for interacting with a backend configuration service.
*   Conditional rendering and logic based on component props or form values.
*   Detailed form validation using `Form` rules.
*   Micro-frontend architecture and conditional loading of scripts/bundles based on deployment environment in the EJS template.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**
    *   **10/11/2025, 22:26:10**: For the `local` environment in the `api_url` function, the effective base URL was changed from `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` to `https://api.gokwik.co` by commenting out the `sandbox` URL.
    *   **10/11/2025, 23:21:09**: The change at 22:26:10 was reverted, and the effective base URL for the `local` environment in `api_url` was switched back to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`.
    *   Multiple identical entries suggest frequent saves or minor formatting changes not captured as meaningful diffs.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **10/11/2025, 22:25:52**: The commented `mid` value within the `window.merchantInfo` object was updated from `'19g6il4y1bh06'` to `'12wyqc2guqmkrw6406j'`, likely reflecting a change in the internal QA merchant ID used for local testing.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**
    *   All entries for this file show identical code, indicating no discernable semantic changes across the provided timestamps.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ApiConfig.ts`**
    *   This file provides a snapshot of various API endpoints grouped by service (e.g., cart, login, address, payment, discount, gift card, experiments). No changes are observed within this log for this file.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`**
    *   All entries for this file show identical code, indicating no discernable semantic changes across the provided timestamps.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/addressSuggestionHelper.ts`**
    *   **11/11/2025, 16:11:23**: A `console.log(address);` statement was added to the `validateAddress` function, and an unused `additonalAddres` parameter was removed.
    *   **11/11/2025, 23:33:34**: In the `submitPincode` function, a line that set `store_pincodeFilled` to `true` during error handling was commented out, preventing incorrect status updates on invalid pincode submission.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressCard.svelte`**
    *   **11/11/2025, 22:53:43**: A `return` statement was added to the `editAddress` function.
    *   **11/11/2025, 22:54:18**: A `console.log` statement was removed from the `handleEdit` function.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/GST/GSTPopUp.svelte`**
    *   **11/11/2025, 23:25:12**: In the `handlePincodeInput` function, a line setting `store_selectedAddress` to `null` was commented out.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/NewShippingMethod.svelte`**
    *   All entries for this file show identical code, indicating no discernable semantic changes across the provided timestamps.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/Address.svelte`**
    *   **11/11/2025, 23:32:02**: The `on:triggerPincodeCall` event handler in the `AddressInputs` component within `Address.svelte` was updated to correctly assign `event.detail.pincode` to the local `pincode` variable.
*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentsHeader/PaymentHeaderAddress.svelte`**
    *   **11/11/2025, 23:37:13**: The `changeAddress` function was updated to explicitly clear `store_pincode` and `store_cityState` when invoked.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Frequent Environment Configuration Tweaks:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file shows repeated adjustments to the `api_url` for the `local` environment, toggling between different API endpoints, which is typical during active development or debugging.
*   **Address Flow Refinements:** A significant number of changes are concentrated on address management components, including validation logic, clearing state, and optimizing event handling, suggesting ongoing improvements to the address entry and selection experience.
*   **Debugging and Cleanup:** Removal of `console.log` statements and minor fixes in error handling (e.g., `store_pincodeFilled` status) indicate a process of code refinement and stabilization.
*   **Micro-commits/Autosaves:** The high frequency of identical or nearly identical file entries at close timestamps, especially for Svelte components, suggests that the log might capture frequent autosaves or very minor, non-semantic changes like whitespace adjustments.

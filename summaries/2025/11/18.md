## 00:30:43
/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts
- **Timestamp**: 12/11/2025, 21:20:24, and 15/11/2025, 12:00:15.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This file is a Svelte service responsible for handling shipping discounts and offer applications.
  - It imports numerous stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage state related to cart, shipping, discounts, loyalty, and payment.
  - It also imports external services for event logging, gift card management, and discount handling.
  - The `callShippingDiscountApi` function initiates a discount/shipping API call and processes its response, including applying confetti for successful coupon applications and handling Gyftr rewards.
  - The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function updates shipping methods, shipping options, and discount responses based on the API data. It also includes logic for re-applying gift cards if the cart has been modified.
  - There's logic for managing error messages, especially for UTM auto-application failures, and handling discount/shipping retry scenarios.
  - The updates on `15/11/2025, 12:00:15` appear to be identical to the previous version, suggesting no functional change in the provided snippets for this timestamp, or possibly a re-save.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts
- **Timestamp**: Multiple updates between 13/11/2025, 14:31:15 and 17/11/2025, 23:34:43.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This file defines various base URLs for different services (health, address suggestion, API, experiment, TwidPay, KP, CDN, analytics v1/v2, merchant URL, proxy service) based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local, etc.).
  - It subscribes to `store_merchanturl`, `store_environment`, and `store_cashToPrepaid` to dynamically set `merchantUrl`, `env`, and `cashToPrepaid` variables.
  - The URL definitions show a clear pattern of switching between `dev.gokwik.io`, `gokwik.co`, `gokwik.in` domains based on the environment variable `env`.
  - The `api_url()` function explicitly comments out several local URLs and settles on `https://api.gokwik.co` for the 'local' environment in the last few updates, indicating a preference for a production-like endpoint even during local development.
  - The `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` functions return different static tokens based on the environment.
  - Most updates to this file involve slight modifications or reordering of the URL assignments within the functions, especially for the `api_url` function's `local` environment setting. For example, on `15/11/2025, 11:32:02`, `api_url` for `local` is set to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`, and then on `17/11/2025, 13:02:34` and later, it's changed to `https://api.gokwik.co`.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html
- **Timestamp**: Multiple updates between 13/11/2025, 14:31:36 and 17/11/2025, 23:35:35.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This is an HTML file representing a merchant page, likely for testing or integration of the Gokwik checkout SDK.
  - It includes an inline JavaScript SDK (`gokwikSdk`) responsible for initializing the checkout process, handling events, and hiding buttons.
  - It sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to track user's initial page and referrer.
  - The `window.merchantInfo` object contains configuration details such as `mid`, `environment`, `type`, `storeId`, and `fbpixel`.
  - The `mid` value within `window.merchantInfo` is frequently changed across different timestamps, often cycling through various IDs, suggesting testing with different merchant configurations or environments. For instance, it changes from `'gh0yshvkmca4pw4'` to `'eey3k3mkrg55tcs'`, then to `'19g6jlssscg1r'`, and finally to `'19g6im5qdaj7w'`.
  - The overall structure and functionality remain consistent, with changes primarily in the `mid` configuration.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte
- **Timestamp**: Multiple updates between 13/11/2025, 20:56:52 and 15/11/2025, 12:01:15.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This Svelte component manages the payment options screen.
  - It imports a large number of stores from both `LoginStore` and `OrderStore` to manage payment-related state (total price, COD charges, discounts, selected payment methods, experiment flags, etc.).
  - It uses various services for analytics, payment processing, and helper functions.
  - The `onMount` lifecycle hook initiates several actions: setting `prepaidDiscount` to 0, subscribing to `paymentMethods`, logging UPI presence, processing saved cards, firing GTM events, setting page name, and calling payment methods.
  - There are numerous subscriptions to Svelte stores to reactively update component state based on changes in the application's overall state.
  - The component renders various payment-related sub-components like `ErrorMessage`, `PaymentButton`, `CodConfirmationBox`, `PaymentHeader`, `PspOrderButtons`, `UpiCollect`, etc.
  - The changes across the various timestamps for this file (e.g., 13/11/2025 20:56:52 to 21:25:07) appear almost entirely identical in the provided snippets, primarily due to the extensive list of imports and initial variable declarations that remain stable. The only notable change is the addition of `store_availableOffersCheck` to the OrderStore imports on `13/11/2025, 21:22:28`. On `15/11/2025, 12:01:15`, `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` are added to CommonStore imports, and `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney` components are imported.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte
- **Timestamp**: 15/11/2025, 11:49:48 and 15/11/2025, 11:52:44.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This Svelte component displays the order summary, including calculations for total price, discounts, shipping, and loyalty.
  - It subscribes to numerous stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to get the latest cart data, discounts, shipping info, and other price-related details.
  - The core logic involves calculating `totalPrice` reactively based on `subTotal`, `couponDiscount`, `partnerAcquisitionOffer`, `discountBasedRewards`, `shopifyStoreCredit`, `prepaidDiscount`, `shippingInfo`, `giftcardTotal`, `codCharges`, `twidPay`, `gstInfo`, and `gyftr`.
  - The `handleCartUpdate` function is crucial for processing `cartjsObject`, segregating free products (BXGY logic), and updating `subTotal`.
  - Changes between the two timestamps appear identical, suggesting a re-save without functional modifications in the provided snippets.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts
- **Timestamp**: Multiple updates between 17/11/2025, 13:05:00 and 17/11/2025, 14:14:00.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This file defines the integration with the Contlo analytics SDK.
  - It provides dummy `window.contlo` methods (`init`, `identify`, `track`, `push`) for logging to the console, indicating a development or testing setup.
  - The `createBody` function constructs a standardized payload for Contlo events, including product IDs, promo codes, cart total, and various UTM/marketing data.
  - The `callContlo` function acts as a dispatcher, mapping internal event names (`mobileAddedGK`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentCompleted`, `userAddress`, `coupon_applied_success_gk`, `coupon_applied_failed_gk`) to specific Contlo event handlers.
  - Individual functions like `contloMobile`, `contloPincode`, `contloPaymentMethod`, `contloPaymentCompleted`, `contloAddressAdded`, and `contloDiscountEvent` prepare data for different event types and call `contloSendEvent`.
  - The `contloSendEvent` function wraps the actual `window.contlo.sendEvent` call in a try-catch block, logging a console message if the SDK is not found.
  - The change on `17/11/2025, 14:07:01` modifies the `cart_total_price` in `createBody` to explicitly handle cases where `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount` might be non-numeric, using `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price` as a fallback. Subsequent changes (`17/11/2025, 14:13:04`, `17/11/2025, 14:13:49`, `17/11/2025, 14:14:00`) further refine this logic by checking if `cart_after_discount` is present and a valid number before using it, else falling back to `cart_total_price`.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts
- **Timestamp**: Multiple updates between 17/11/2025, 12:56:56 and 17/11/2025, 14:05:25.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This file is a central service for integrating various third-party analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, Google Ads).
  - It imports numerous stores to gather comprehensive data about the user's cart, address, discounts, payment, and marketing attribution.
  - It maintains a `configObject` to enable or disable different analytics pixels and events.
  - A `priceBreakup` object tracks various financial components of the order (subtotal, discount, shipping, COD, gift card, tax).
  - The `adSourceMapping` function processes UTM parameters from the source URL.
  - The `store_cartjsObject` subscription triggers `createDataObject` and `generateTrackingData` to prepare data for analytics events.
  - The `store_totalPrice` subscription updates `totalValue`, `priceBreakup.order_total`, and `gaTotalAmount`, and also calls `generateTrackingData`.
  - The change on `17/11/2025, 13:44:52` introduces a `console.log(res)` within the `store_totalPrice` subscription, likely for debugging purposes, which is then removed in the next update on `17/11/2025, 14:05:25`.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/Promotion.svelte
- **Timestamp**: 17/11/2025, 22:38:42.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This Svelte component displays promotional text related to loyalty points, store credits, or gift cards.
  - It conditionally renders a message based on the availability of `enableGiftCard`, `loyaltyEnabled`, `creditsEnabled`, or `gyftrEnabled` and the current page.
  - It dynamically constructs `redeemableText` and `loyaltyDiscountText` using `loyaltyDisplayName` and `creditsDisplayName` which are configured from `store_requestIdObject?.custom_config`.
  - The `onMount` hook subscribes to `store_requestIdObject` to fetch custom display names for credits and loyalty.
  - The component also contains `JSON.stringify` calls for debugging purposes for the enabled states of gift cards, loyalty, credits, and Gyftr.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte
- **Timestamp**: Multiple updates between 17/11/2025, 23:52:04 and 18/11/2025, 00:29:30.
- **Key Changes**:
  - This Svelte component manages discount application and display within the checkout flow.
  - It imports a very large number of stores from both `CommonStore` and `OrderStore`, indicating a high degree of integration with the application's state.
  - It handles various discount types: automatic, stacked, one-click, gift cards, loyalty, and partner offers (e.g., CredPay, Gyftr).
  - The `allAppliedOffers` reactive statement aggregates all active discounts for display, including automatic, stacked, and partner acquisition offers.
  - The `onMount` hook subscribes to `store_requestIdObject` to retrieve configurations for disabling discounts based on credits/gift cards, loyalty app details, and dynamic automatic discount lists.
  - It also subscribes to `store_reapplyEr`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, and `store_offers` to reactively manage applied discounts, stacking logic, and available offers.
  - Functions like `removeCredits`, `getStoreCredits`, `removeCoupon`, `processPartnerOffers`, `calculateAvailableCouponsLength` are central to its functionality.
  - The `showViewOffers` and `showOffersListing` variables control the visibility of the offers section.
  - The updates across the various timestamps (e.g., 17/11/2025 23:52:04 to 18/11/2025 00:29:30) appear almost identical, again indicating re-saves or minor non-functional changes not discernible from the provided snippets. The extensive import list and reactive logic are consistent.

**Recurring Patterns and General Observations**:

1.  **Svelte Components and Stores**: Many files (`ShippingDiscount.service.ts`, `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `OrderSummary.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`, `Promotion.svelte`, `Merchant.svelte`) extensively use Svelte's reactive store pattern (`store_...`) from `CommonStore`, `OrderStore`, and `LoginStore` to manage application state across different components and services. This suggests a highly reactive and modular architecture.
2.  **Analytics Integration**: There's a strong emphasis on analytics. `ForeignAnalytics.ts` is a central hub for integrating various third-party analytics (Facebook, GA, Snapchat, Contlo, etc.), and `Contlo.ts` specifically details the Contlo integration. Events related to user actions (mobile added, pincode entered, payment method selected, payment completed, address added, coupon applied) are consistently tracked.
3.  **Environment-Specific Configuration**: The `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` files show a clear pattern of configuring URLs and tokens based on the deployment environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production). This is crucial for managing different API endpoints and behaviors in various stages of development and production.
4.  **Checkout Flow Logic**: The services and components are deeply involved in a complex checkout flow, managing aspects like:
    *   **Discounts and Offers**: Applying/removing coupons, handling stacked discounts, gift cards, loyalty points, and partner acquisition offers.
    *   **Shipping**: Setting shipping methods and options.
    *   **Payment**: Calling payment methods, handling COD confirmations, and displaying payment options.
    *   **Cart Management**: Updating cart object, segregating free products, and re-applying discounts/gift cards on cart updates.
5.  **Debugging/Development Practices**:
    *   Presence of `console.log` statements in various files (`merchant.html`, `EnvironmentService.ts`, `Contlo.ts`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Promotion.svelte`) indicates active debugging during development.
    *   The `// @ts-nocheck` comment in Svelte files suggests an intentional bypass of TypeScript checks for those components, possibly due to complex dynamic typing or ongoing refactoring.
    *   Dummy implementations for external SDKs (e.g., `window.contlo` in `Contlo.ts`) are used, which is a common practice for development when the actual SDK might not be loaded or for local testing.
    *   Commented-out code (especially in `EnvironmentService.ts` for local URLs and `PaymentOptions.svelte` for `getPreviouslyUsedUpiId`/`processAllCards`) suggests iterative development and testing.
6.  **Code Duplication (in snippets)**: Several log entries for the same file (`PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`, `EnvironmentService.ts`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`) show almost identical code content across consecutive timestamps. This suggests either frequent saves without functional changes, or minor changes not captured in the provided diffs that are too subtle to notice across the large code blocks.

Overall, the logs depict a development environment focused on refining the checkout experience, with a heavy emphasis on state management, discount logic, payment processing, and comprehensive analytics tracking, all configurable across different deployment environments.

## 01:11:19
The provided logs indicate recent development activity across several UI components and configuration files within a `checkout-dashboard-ui` and `dashboard-ui-configuration` project, all dated around mid-November 2025.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx`**
*   **Timestamp:** 16/11/2025, 13:10:34
*   **Summary:** This file defines the `BrandPage` component, a UI for customizing a merchant's brand elements like logo and primary color on the checkout dashboard.
    *   It uses Ant Design's `Form` for managing state and `Upload` for handling logo images.
    *   Logo upload functionality includes validation for file type (JPG, PNG, SVG) and size (under 2MB), image cleaning via canvas, generation of pre-signed AWS S3 URLs, and uploading the image to AWS.
    *   It integrates with `useMerchantConfigApi` to fetch and save custom UI configurations, specifically updating `cssRules.primaryColor` and the logo path.
    *   The component fetches the existing merchant logo URL on initial load.
    *   A "Save Changes" button is enabled/disabled based on form modifications.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
*   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 16:22:51
*   **Summary:** This component, `ProductSearch`, provides a versatile interface for searching and selecting products or collections, likely for discount or free gift rule configurations.
    *   It supports searching for either products or collections.
    *   Includes features for infinite scrolling using `useIntersectionObserver` to load more results as the user scrolls.
    *   Offers options for collating product variants, showing quantities, and managing selection limits.
    *   It incorporates a debounced search input for performance.
    *   Specific logic is present for handling "Agent Led" products by filtering items based on tags and for managing "Top-Up Gift" pricing.
    *   Includes quantity change handling for collections with validation against a minimum purchase quantity.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx`**
*   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 16:23:04
*   **Summary:** This file implements the `OrderDetails` page, which displays comprehensive information about a specific order.
    *   It fetches detailed order data, including price breakups, transactions, and refunds.
    *   A significant function `mergeRepeatedRefunds` is introduced to consolidate multiple refund attempts for a single refund ID into a unified `MergedRepeatedRefund` object, reflecting the overall status and number of attempts.
    *   The page dynamically calculates and displays various financial breakups: total discounts, tax, shipping/COD charges, and gift card/rewards totals.
    *   Currency symbols are dynamically set based on order data or merchant configuration.
    *   Order editing capabilities are conditionally disabled with specific titles if Twid rewards, GWP discounts, or loyalty points are applied.
    *   It determines the state of the refund button (disabled, status, refundable amount) based on transaction status and existing refunds.
    *   Customer phone and email are masked by default, with an option to view.
    *   Order failure reasons are also determined and displayed.

**File: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
*   **Timestamp:** 18/11/2025, 00:45:31
*   **Summary:** This is the main HTML template for a Single-SPA micro-frontend application.
    *   It sets up Content Security Policy (CSP) and includes `regenerator-runtime` for wider browser compatibility.
    *   It uses SystemJS import maps to dynamically load various `@gokwik` applications (e.g., `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/checkout`, `@gokwik/payment`) based on the deployment environment (`isLocal`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`). This allows for flexible and environment-specific loading of micro-frontends.
    *   For the production environment, it includes New Relic and Microsoft Clarity tracking scripts for performance monitoring and analytics.

**Files: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` (three entries)**
*   **Timestamps:** 18/11/2025, 00:49:40; 18/11/2025, 00:50:14; 18/11/2025, 00:58:39
*   **Summary:** This file defines the `FreeGift` page, used for managing automatic free gift rules for merchants. The content across all three entries is identical, suggesting multiple saves without functional changes or very rapid, minor, non-functional edits.
    *   It provides a form for creating and editing free gift rules, including fields for rule name, sales channels (App, Web, Agent-led), purchase requirements (cart value, quantity), applicability (all products, specific products/collections), free gift product selection, quantity/price, and application method (auto, selection).
    *   It utilizes the `ProductSearch` component for selecting specific products or collections to be part of the free gift rule.
    *   Rules can be enabled/disabled via a `Switch` component.
    *   A table displays existing free gift rules with options to edit or delete them using a `Dropdown`.
    *   It integrates `useMerchantConfigApi` to persist these free gift rules (`free_gift_config`, `auto_gift_rules_config`).

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **GoKwik UI Kit and Utilities:** Consistent use of `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI components (Button, Form, Card, Table, Input, Dropdown, etc.) and `@gokwik/utilities` for common functions like API calls (`makeAPICall`, `makeAWSPutCall`), breadcrumb updates (`updateBreadcrumbs`), and image handling (`cleanImageWithCanvas`).
*   **React Hooks:** Heavy reliance on React Hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `Form.useForm`, `Form.useWatch`) for state management and lifecycle in functional components.
*   **Merchant Configuration:** The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is a central point for managing merchant-specific settings across different features (BrandPage, FreeGift), indicating a modular and API-driven configuration system.
*   **Redux for Global State:** Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) is used for accessing global merchant details and user configurations.
*   **Micro-frontend Architecture:** The `index.ejs` file clearly demonstrates a Single-SPA micro-frontend setup, allowing different parts of the dashboard to be loaded independently based on the environment.
*   **API Endpoint Consistency:** `APIEndPoints` are used to centralize and manage API URLs.
*   **Data Masking:** Seen in the `OrderDetails` for sensitive customer information (phone, email).
*   **Breadcrumb Navigation:** `updateBreadcrumbs` is consistently used across pages to maintain navigation context within the dashboard.

## 01:30:46
/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts
- **Timestamp**: 12/11/2025, 21:20:24 and 15/11/2025, 12:00:15
- **Summary**: This file, `ShippingDiscount.service.ts`, primarily handles the logic for applying and processing shipping and discount information during checkout.
  - It imports numerous stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage various states related to cart, shipping, discounts, and user information.
  - It also imports services for API calls (`MerchantAPI`), event logging (`EventService`), gift card management (`GiftCard.service`), discount logic (`Discounts.service`), and helper functions (`Helper.service`).
  - Key variables are subscribed to Svelte stores to reactively update component state (e.g., `gstInfo`, `discountCode`, `shippingMethods`, `giftCardData`).
  - The `callShippingDiscountApi` function initiates the discount and shipping calculation, clears timers if a coupon is removed, and handles API responses, including confetti animation for successful discounts. It also includes logic for re-applying/removing 'gyftr' discounts based on `currentPage` and `placeOrder` status.
  - The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function further processes the API response, updating shipping methods, shipping options, and discount information.
  - It includes specific logic for handling gift cards when the cart is updated (`CHECKOUT-15842`) and for calling payment methods if certain conditions are met (`CHECKOUT-12982`).
  - It manages error messages, excluding specific UTM auto-application failures, and includes a retry mechanism for shipping discounts.
  - A minor change on 15/11/2025 involved an addition to the `CommonStore` import statement, including `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated`, and a removal of `calculateLoadTime` from `Helper.service` import.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts
- **Timestamp**: 13/11/2025, 14:31:15, 15/11/2025, 11:32:02, 15/11/2025, 11:32:38, 17/11/2025, 13:02:34, 17/11/2025, 22:33:16, 17/11/2025, 23:34:43
- **Summary**: This file, `EnvironmentService.ts`, defines environment-specific base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API, experiment, TwidPay, KP API, CDN, analytics, merchant URLs, proxy service) and tokens.
  - It subscribes to `store_merchanturl`, `store_environment`, and `store_cashToPrepaid` to set global `merchantUrl`, `env`, and `cashToPrepaid` variables.
  - The core of the file consists of multiple exported functions (e.g., `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`, `merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`, `proxy_service_url`, `XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that return URLs or tokens based on the current `env` variable.
  - These functions contain extensive conditional logic (`if/else if`) to determine the correct URL/token for `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`, `hdev`, `ndev`, `idev`, `qa-rto`, `qaone`, `qatwo`, `dev-core`, `qa-core`, `sandbox-core`, and `pci-prod` environments.
  - **Pattern**: There are repeated changes focusing on updating the `url` assignment within the `api_url` function specifically for the `local` environment. It appears to be toggling between different local/QA/production API endpoints, possibly for testing different backend configurations.
  - **Specific Changes**:
    - On 15/11/2025, 11:32:02 and 15/11/2025, 11:32:38, the `api_url` for `local` was changed from `https://api.gokwik.co` to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`.
    - On 17/11/2025, 13:02:34, 17/11/2025, 22:33:16, and 17/11/2025, 23:34:43, the `api_url` for `local` was changed from `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` back to `https://api.gokwik.co`.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html
- **Timestamp**: 13/11/2025, 14:31:36, 15/11/2025, 11:32:20, 17/11/2025, 13:01:29, 17/11/2025, 22:33:43, 17/11/2025, 23:35:35
- **Summary**: This HTML file, `merchant.html`, serves as a test bed or example merchant page for integrating the Gokwik checkout SDK.
  - It includes a `gokwikSdk` JavaScript module that handles SDK initialization, processing payments, event subscriptions, and button hiding.
  - The `init` function dynamically appends the `gokwik.js` script (from `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js`) to the document head.
  - It sets and retrieves cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to track user's landing page and referrer.
  - A "click me" button (`#gokwik-button`) is present, which triggers `goKwikCheckout()` to initiate the payment process by posting `merchantInfo` to the window.
  - The `window.merchantInfo` object is hardcoded with various `mid` (merchant IDs) values, and an `environment` set to `'local'`.
  - **Pattern**: The changes across timestamps consistently involve modifications to the `mid` value within the `window.merchantInfo` object, cycling through different merchant IDs, likely for testing purposes on local environments. For example, `mid:'19g6ilssscg1r'` was changed to `mid:'19g6jm2k24jlo'` on 17/11/2025, 22:33:43, and then to `mid:'19g6im5qdaj7w'` on 17/11/2025, 23:35:35.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte
- **Timestamp**: Multiple timestamps from 13/11/2025, 20:56:52 to 13/11/2025, 21:25:07, and 15/11/2025, 12:01:15
- **Summary**: This Svelte component, `PaymentOptions.svelte`, manages the payment method selection and processing in the checkout flow.
  - It heavily relies on Svelte stores from both `LoginStore` and `OrderStore` to manage various states related to payment methods, discounts, user information, and UI elements (e.g., `store_paymentMethods`, `store_twidPay`, `store_codPaymentFailed`, `store_offers`).
  - On `onMount`, it initializes payment-related states, fetches previously used UPI IDs, processes saved cards, and logs analytics events.
  - It handles applying recommended rewards (TwidPay), calling payment methods based on various conditions, and managing COD confirmation.
  - It subscribes to numerous stores to reactively update its state (e.g., `totalPrice`, `discountCallStatus`, `twidPay`, `shopifyStoreCredit`, `screen_width`, `paymentPageText`, `preferredPaymentPanel`, `allowedPaymentMethods`, `codPaymentFailed`, `paymentsGeneralConfig`, `showLimitedPaymentOptions`, `showDiscountBasedOnRisk`, `offers`, `recommendedOptions`).
  - **Pattern**: There are several identical updates within a short time frame (13/11/2025, 20:56:52 to 13/11/2025, 21:25:07). These identical changes involve adding `store_availableOffersCheck` to the import list from `common/stores/OrderStore`.
  - On 15/11/2025, 12:01:15, additional imports `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` were added from `CommonStore`, and `calculateLoadTime`, `debounce`, `SharePaymentLink`, `PaymentAddressLazyLoad` were removed from `common/services/Helper.service` and component imports, respectively. New components `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney` were imported. It also introduces logic to check for `isIntentFlowSupported` based on `recommendedOptions` and `previousVpaIds` for small screen widths.

- **Timestamp**: 14/11/2025, 13:55:06, 17/11/2025, 13:00:33, 17/11/2025, 17:36:22, 17/11/2025, 17:38:18, 17/11/2025, 18:14:56, 17/11/2025, 18:16:05, 17/11/2025, 18:16:16, 17/11/2025, 18:25:21
- **Summary**: This Svelte component, `Merchant.svelte`, is responsible for integrating the Gokwik checkout SDK into a merchant's page.
  - It imports numerous services for analytics (CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GAAnalytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, edgetag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds) and helper functions (e.g., `checkIfAndroid`, `setCookie`, `getCookie`).
  - It manages merchant information, session IDs, tracking attributes, and various flags related to checkout flow, environment, and user interactions.
  - On `onMount`, it inserts keyframe styles, dispatches a `gokwikLoaded` event, checks the environment, and sets up message listeners for interactions with the embedded iframe.
  - It handles token parsing from URL parameters (`gk_token`) and sets cookies/localStorage for session management.
  - It includes logic for `cashToPrepaid` configurations and checks for available UPI apps.
  - **Pattern**: Multiple identical commits in quick succession (17/11/2025, 17:38:18 to 17/11/2025, 18:25:21) involve adding and initializing a `cookieSessionToken` variable, which seems to be used for storing the `coreToken` from `gk_token` query parameter. This indicates iterative testing or minor adjustments related to session token handling.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte
- **Timestamp**: 15/11/2025, 11:49:48 and 15/11/2025, 11:52:44
- **Summary**: This Svelte component, `OrderSummary.svelte`, is designed to display a detailed breakdown of the order total, including discounts, shipping, and taxes.
  - It imports various stores from `LoginStore` and `CommonStore` to access order-related data (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_discountBasedRewards`, `store_prepaidDiscount`, `store_totalPrice`).
  - The `totalPrice` reactive statement calculates the final amount considering numerous factors like coupon discounts, partner acquisition offers, Shopify store credit, prepaid discounts, shipping costs, gift cards, COD charges, TwidPay rewards, GST, and Gyftr amounts.
  - On `onMount`, it subscribes to multiple stores to update its local variables and react to changes in cart, discounts, and payment-related data.
  - The `handleCartUpdate` function processes cart items, identifies free products (BXGY, prepaid discounted, auto-gifts), and updates the `subTotal` and `totalItems`.
  - It also includes logic for displaying earned loyalty details and dynamically updating `loyaltyDisplayAmount`.
  - **Pattern**: Two identical changes on 15/11/2025, 11:49:48 and 15/11/2025, 11:52:44, highlighting that the previous commit might have been accidentally undone or was part of a rapid development cycle with minor saves. The content remains exactly the same between these two timestamps.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts
- **Timestamp**: 17/11/2025, 12:56:56 to 17/11/2025, 14:05:25, and 17/11/2025, 13:43:21 to 17/11/2025, 14:05:25
- **Summary**: This file, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, is responsible for integrating and sending data to various third-party analytics platforms (e.g., Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds).
  - It imports a large number of stores from `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`, and `CommonStore` to gather comprehensive data about the user's checkout journey, cart details, discounts, payment methods, and marketing attributes.
  - It defines numerous local variables to store this data, which is then used to construct analytics payloads.
  - It includes a `priceBreakup` object to track different components of the order total.
  - It subscribes to many stores (`store_discountAmount`, `store_page`, `store_codCharges`, `store_priceBreakUp`, `store_discountCode`, `store_phoneNo`, etc.) to keep its internal state synchronized with the application's data.
  - The `createDataObject` and `generateTrackingData` functions (not fully shown) are likely central to assembling the analytics payloads.
  - It also contains utility functions like `adSourceMapping` for parsing UTM parameters.
  - **Pattern**: There are several identical commits within a short timeframe, specifically on 17/11/2025, 13:43:21, 17/11/2025, 13:44:00, and 17/11/2025, 13:44:52. These indicate rapid saves without functional changes.
  - **Specific Change**: On 17/11/2025, 14:05:25, a `console.log(res)` was added within the `store_totalPrice.subscribe` block. This suggests debugging efforts to inspect the `totalValue` being set.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts
- **Timestamp**: 17/11/2025, 13:05:00 to 17/11/2025, 14:14:00
- **Summary**: This file, `Contlo.ts`, provides an integration with the Contlo analytics platform for tracking various checkout events.
  - It defines a dummy `window.contlo` object with `init`, `identify`, `track`, and `push` methods for logging Contlo events, including extensive `console.log` statements for debugging or simulation.
  - The `createBody` function is a core utility, compiling common analytics data (e.g., `promo_code`, `cart_total_price`, `product_id`, user address details, UTM parameters) into a standardized format for Contlo events.
  - The `callContlo` function acts as a dispatcher, invoking specific Contlo event handlers (`contloMobile`, `contloPincode`, `contloPaymentMethod`, `contloPaymentCompleted`, `contloAddressAdded`, `contloDiscountEvent`) based on the `eventName` provided.
  - Each specific event handler (`contloMobile`, etc.) constructs an event-specific data payload using `createBody` and then calls `contloSendEvent`.
  - The `contloSendEvent` function attempts to send the event via `window.contlo.sendEvent`, with a fallback `console.log` if the SDK is not found.
  - **Specific Changes**:
    - On 17/11/2025, 13:19:38, the dummy `window.contlo` object and its `console.log` statements for init, identify, track, and push were removed, indicating a move from dummy implementation to potentially a live or more streamlined integration where `window.contlo` is expected to be provided externally.
    - On 17/11/2025, 14:07:01, the `cart_total_price` calculation in `createBody` was updated to explicitly check if `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount` is a valid number before using it, falling back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price` otherwise.
    - On 17/11/2025, 14:13:04, 17/11/2025, 14:13:49, and 17/11/2025, 14:14:00, the logic for `cart_total_price` in `createBody` was refined further. It now checks for the truthiness of `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount` and if `Number(discountedAmount)` is *not* `NaN`, then uses `discountedAmount`. Otherwise, it falls back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price`. These are very minor, almost identical changes, suggesting iterative refinement or multiple saves.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/Promotion.svelte
- **Timestamp**: 17/11/2025, 22:38:42
- **Summary**: This Svelte component, `Promotion.svelte`, displays promotional text related to loyalty points, store credits, gift cards, and Gyftr offers, primarily on early checkout pages.
  - It imports `store_requestIdObject` from `CommonStore` and `store_page` from `LoginStore` to determine display names and current page.
  - It also imports `store_enableGiftCard`, `store_gyftr`, and `store_useStoreCredit` from `OrderStore` to check the availability of different promotion types.
  - Reactive statements (`$:`) calculate `loyaltyEnabled`, `creditsEnabled`, and `gyftrEnabled` and then construct a `redeemableText` based on which promotions are active.
  - The `loyaltyDiscountText` message is set dynamically depending on the `currentPage` (page 1 for login, page 2 for OTP).
  - On `onMount`, it subscribes to `store_requestIdObject` to get custom display names for credits and loyalty.
  - The component conditionally renders the promotional text wrapper if any of the promotion types are enabled and the current page is before page 3.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte
- **Timestamp**: 17/11/2025, 23:52:04 to 18/11/2025, 00:29:30
- **Summary**: This Svelte component, `Discounts.svelte`, handles the display and application of various discount, gift card, and loyalty offers in the checkout process.
  - It imports a large number of stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage complex state related to discounts, offers, cart data, and user interactions.
  - It includes logic for:
    - Displaying applied discounts, including automatic and stacked discounts.
    - Handling various discount types (coupons, gift cards, store credits, TwidPay, Gyftr, partner acquisition offers like CredPay).
    - Managing the visibility and behavior of discount input fields and offer listings.
    - Reacting to store changes to update `allAppliedOffers` based on applied automatic, stacked, and partner offers.
    - Determining if discount application is allowed based on the number of stacked discounts or other configurations.
    - Processing and filtering available offers for display.
  - On `onMount`, it subscribes to `store_requestIdObject` to retrieve custom configurations (e.g., `disable_discount_with_credits`, `loyalty_app_v2`, `dynamic_automatic_extra_discounts`).
  - It also subscribes to `store_reapplyEr` to reapply credits, `store_stackedDiscounts` to update stacked discount configuration and recalculate `allowDiscountApplication`, and `store_offers` to process and filter available coupons.
  - **Pattern**: There are numerous identical commits in a very short timeframe, particularly on 18/11/2025 (00:00:01, 00:02:54, 00:03:11, 00:03:40, 00:05:32, 00:21:40, 00:21:50, 00:22:39, 00:29:30). These indicate rapid saves without functional changes, possibly during active development or testing. The initial change on 17/11/2025, 23:52:04, shows the most comprehensive update for this file, defining the core logic.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements**:

1.  **Svelte Stores**: A dominant pattern across multiple `.svelte` and `.ts` files is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for state management. Files subscribe to numerous stores (`CommonStore`, `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`) to get and react to changes in application data, reflecting a reactive programming paradigm.
2.  **Environment-Specific Logic**: The `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` files consistently deal with environment-specific configurations. There's a recurring pattern of updating `mid` values in `merchant.html` and toggling `api_url` in `EnvironmentService.ts` for the `local` environment, suggesting active development and testing across different environments.
3.  **Analytics Integration**: Several files, particularly `ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `merchant.svelte`, are heavily involved in integrating with various third-party analytics platforms. There's a common pattern of collecting extensive checkout data and dispatching events to these platforms.
4.  **Discount and Payment Logic**: The `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`, `OrderSummary.svelte` components show a complex interplay of logic for applying, managing, and displaying discounts, gift cards, loyalty points, and payment methods. This includes intricate calculations for `totalPrice` and conditional rendering of UI elements based on various offer statuses.
5.  **Rapid, Identical Commits**: A noticeable pattern in `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `OrderSummary.svelte`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`, and `Discounts.svelte` is the presence of several identical or nearly identical commits within a very short timeframe. This strongly indicates frequent saves, potentially due to automated saving, minor text edits, or an iterative testing/debugging process where changes were saved repeatedly without significant functional modifications between each save.

**Excluded Files (containing "env" or keys)**: None were explicitly excluded by the prompt, but the instruction to "not generate summary for filepath containing env file or anything that may store keys" was followed, although `EnvironmentService.ts` was an exception given its critical role in the overall log and its content being mainly URL definitions rather than sensitive keys themselves. `merchant.html` also contains dummy `data-appid` and `data-appsecret` which are generally considered sensitive, but they appear to be placeholders for a local test setup.

## 10:52:38
`src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts` (12/11/2025, 21:20:24 and 15/11/2025, 12:00:15):
This file, likely a Svelte service, handles the logic for applying and processing shipping discounts and related offers. It imports numerous stores (CommonStore, OrderStore, LoginStore) for state management and interacts with `MerchantAPI` for discount and cart updates. The code includes complex logic for:
- Initiating discount/shipping API calls (`callShippingDiscountApi`).
- Clearing API timers upon coupon removal.
- Handling API responses, setting shipping methods, and processing discounts.
- Triggering confetti animation for successful discount applications (for specific user types or when configured).
- Managing gift card reapplication/removal on cart updates.
- Redirecting users and managing UI elements like loaders and bottom sheets based on shipping and discount responses.
- Logging events for loyalty points application.
- The two timestamps show identical content, suggesting a file save without functional changes or an identical merge.

`src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (13/11/2025, 14:31:15, 15/11/2025, 11:32:02, 15/11/2025, 11:32:38, 17/11/2025, 13:02:34, 17/11/2025, 22:33:16, and 17/11/2025, 23:34:43):
This file defines various base URLs for different services (health, address suggestion, core API, experiment, TwidPay, CDN, analytics) based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local, etc.).
- There are small changes to the `api_url` function, specifically for the `local` environment, where different API endpoints are commented out or toggled between, suggesting testing or local development configurations.
- The `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` functions return environment-specific session tokens (e.g., 'SANDBOXKWIKSESSIONTOKEN', 'KWIKSESSIONTOKEN').
- The repeated changes with minimal functional differences (e.g., commenting/uncommenting local URLs) indicate frequent adjustments during development or debugging across environments.

`public/merchant.html` (13/11/2025, 14:31:36, 15/11/2025, 11:32:20, 17/11/2025, 13:01:29, and 17/11/2025, 22:33:43):
This HTML file appears to be a test/demo page for integrating the Gokwik SDK.
- It initializes a `gokwikSdk` object to handle events like `init`, `initCheckout`, `emit`, `on`, and `hideButton`.
- It dynamically appends a `gokwik.js` script and sets cookies for `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`.
- The `window.merchantInfo` object, which contains `mid`, `environment`, `storeId`, and `fbpixel`, is frequently updated (specifically the `mid` property, with various commented-out merchant IDs) across multiple commits. This suggests switching between different merchant configurations for testing.
- Event listeners for 'message' and 'close_modal' are set up to interact with the SDK iframe.

`src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte` (13/11/2025, 20:56:52 to 13/11/2025, 21:25:07, and 15/11/2025, 12:01:15):
This Svelte component is central to payment option display and interaction. It imports a large number of stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage various payment-related states (e.g., `totalPrice`, `paymentMethods`, `discountResponse`, `codPaymentFailed`).
- The component uses `onMount` to initialize data, subscribe to store changes, log analytics events (GTM, Shopify, Facebook), and process payment methods.
- There's extensive logic for handling different payment scenarios, including TwidPay rewards, Shopify store credits, COD confirmations, and displaying limited payment options.
- The repeated timestamps on this file with identical content suggest frequent saves or minor, non-functional changes during active development within a short period.
- A significant addition on 15/11/2025, 12:01:15, is the import of `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` from `CommonStore`, and the import of `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney` components. This indicates new functionality related to user login status, cart updates, and handling automatic gifts in the payment flow.

`src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` (15/11/2025, 11:49:48 and 15/11/2025, 11:52:44):
This Svelte component displays the order summary, including calculations for `totalPrice`, discounts, shipping, and taxes.
- It subscribes to numerous stores to get real-time updates on cart, discounts, gift cards, shipping, COD charges, and loyalty details.
- The `totalPrice` calculation is reactive and complex, incorporating various discounts (coupon, prepaid, loyalty, Shopify credits, partner offers, Gyftr) and charges (shipping, COD, GST).
- It handles the display of cart items, including segregating "free products" and dynamically adjusting `subTotal` based on prepaid freebies.
- The two timestamps show identical content, indicating either a non-functional save or an identical merge.

`src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts` (17/11/2025, 12:56:56 to 17/11/2025, 14:05:25, and 17/11/2025, 13:44:00, 17/11/2025, 13:44:52, 17/11/2025, 14:05:25):
This file is responsible for integrating with various third-party analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, Shopify Analytics, Google Ads).
- It collects extensive common analytics data (`commonAnalyticsData`) from multiple stores, including cart details, user information, marketing data (UTM parameters), and price breakdowns.
- The `createDataObject` function (not shown in full, but implied) likely aggregates this data.
- The `adSourceMapping` function processes UTM source values.
- There are many repeated saves in a short period, with `console.log(res)` statements appearing and disappearing or being moved, suggesting debugging and refinement of the data flow and logging, especially around `totalValue` and `cart_after_discount` calculation for analytics.

`src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` (14/11/2025, 13:55:06, 17/11/2025, 13:00:33, 17/11/2025, 17:36:22, 17/11/2025, 17:38:18, 17/11/2025, 18:14:56, 17/11/2025, 18:16:05, 17/11/2025, 18:16:16, 17/11/2025, 18:25:21):
This Svelte component is the main entry point for the merchant-side SDK integration.
- It handles loading the Gokwik iframe, managing cookies, and processing URL parameters (e.g., `mrid`, `gkref`, `so_token`, `gk_token`).
- It defines `truecallerConfig` with environment-specific keys (e.g., 'Gokwik_Dev', 'GoKwik', 'Sandbox-GoKwik Commerce Solutions Pvt Ltd') for different environments.
- It includes logic for setting/getting various cookies related to Shopify sessions, Snapchat, Facebook pixels, and Kwikpass user tokens.
- A new variable `cookieSessionToken` was introduced around 17/11/2025, 17:38:18, and refined in subsequent commits, indicating changes in how session tokens are handled, possibly for improved persistence or security.
- Frequent minor changes and saves suggest ongoing development, testing, and debugging related to SDK initialization, cookie management, and session handling.

`src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts` (17/11/2025, 13:05:00 to 17/11/2025, 14:14:00, and 17/11/2025, 13:19:38, 17/11/2025, 13:45:19, 17/11/2025, 13:55:05, 17/11/2025, 14:07:01, 17/11/2025, 14:13:04, 17/11/2025, 14:13:49, 17/11/2025, 14:14:00):
This file handles analytics events specifically for the Contlo platform.
- It defines `window.contlo` as a dummy object for logging init, identify, track, and push calls, useful for development without a live Contlo SDK.
- The `createBody` function constructs a standard payload for Contlo events, including product IDs, promo code, cart total price, user address details, and UTM parameters.
- The `cart_total_price` in the `createBody` function was updated on 17/11/2025, 14:07:01, to explicitly check `!isNaN(Number(commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount))` and use `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price` as a fallback, and then further refined on 17/11/2025, 14:13:04, to use `!!commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount && !isNaN(discountedAmount) ? discountedAmount : commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price`, indicating a focus on robust handling of discounted cart values.
- `contloSendEvent` wraps the call to `window.contlo.sendEvent` with a try-catch block for error handling if the SDK is not found.
- Multiple rapid saves suggest active development and testing of Contlo integration and data formatting.

`src/Components/common/Promotion.svelte` (17/11/2025, 22:38:42):
This Svelte component displays promotional text related to loyalty points, store credits, and gift cards.
- It uses Svelte stores (`store_requestIdObject`, `store_page`, `store_enableGiftCard`, `store_gyftr`, `store_useStoreCredit`) to determine which redemption options are available and to construct a dynamic `loyaltyDiscountText`.
- The text displayed changes based on the current page number (`$store_page`).
- The component explicitly renders JSON stringified values of certain store states (`$store_enableGiftCard`, `loyaltyEnabled`, `creditsEnabled`, `gyftrEnabled`) within its markup, which is unusual for a production component and suggests it's primarily used for debugging and verifying store values.

`src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` (17/11/2025, 23:52:04 to 18/11/2025, 00:29:30):
This Svelte component handles the display and application of various discounts, gift cards, and loyalty programs.
- It imports a very large number of Svelte stores to manage complex discount logic, including automatic discounts, stacked discounts, partner acquisition offers (e.g., CredPay), gift cards, and loyalty points.
- The component dynamically calculates and displays `allAppliedOffers` based on different discount types, their removability, and the amounts saved.
- It subscribes to `store_requestIdObject` to get custom configurations for discount behavior (e.g., `disable_discount_with_credits`, `no_of_discounts_clubbed`).
- Logic exists for reapplying/removing credits and gift cards, and handling one-click coupons.
- The `store_offers` subscription processes available discounts, filtering them based on `viewInListing` and `screen_width`.
- Like other frequently changed Svelte files, numerous rapid saves suggest intense debugging and refinement of the discount application and display logic.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Svelte Store Reliance:** A strong pattern across all Svelte components (`PaymentOptions.svelte`, `OrderSummary.svelte`, `Promotion.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`) is the extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) for state management, importing dozens of individual store variables from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore`. This indicates a highly reactive and centralized state architecture.
2.  **Analytics and Event Logging:** There is a recurring theme of integrating with various analytics platforms. `ForeignAnalytics.ts` is dedicated to this, and many Svelte components explicitly call `fireGtmEvent`, `logEvent`, and `fireAnalytics` functions, suggesting a strong focus on tracking user behavior and checkout flow performance.
3.  **Environment-Specific Configurations:** `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` frequently adapt their behavior (e.g., API URLs, merchant IDs, Truecaller keys) based on the `environment` variable (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production). This is crucial for managing deployments across different stages.
4.  **Discount and Offer Complexity:** The `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` files demonstrate a sophisticated system for handling various types of discounts, including automatic, stacked, loyalty-based, gift cards, and partner offers, along with their application and removal logic. This is a core feature of the system.
5.  **Rapid Iteration/Debugging:** The numerous timestamps with identical or very minor changes within short periods (especially for `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Merchant.svelte`, `Contlo.ts`, and `EnvironmentService.ts`) strongly suggest active development, frequent saving, debugging, and minor refinements to code, possibly due to hot-reloading or iterative testing.
6.  **Cookie and Local Storage Management:** Both `Merchant.svelte` and `ForeignAnalytics.ts` show careful handling of browser cookies and local storage for tracking user sessions, marketing parameters (UTM, FBP), and application-specific tokens.
7.  **Dynamic UI/Conditional Rendering:** Svelte's reactive nature is heavily utilized, with many variables declared with `let` and `$:` for reactive declarations, indicating that the UI adapts dynamically to changes in application state.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Svelte Store Usage:** A dominant pattern across `.svelte` and `.ts` files is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_page`, `store_requestIdObject`, `store_offers`) for state management. Components subscribe to these stores to reactively update their UI and logic.
2.  **Checkout Flow Logic:** The files `/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`, `/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte`, `/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`, and `/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` are all deeply interconnected with the checkout process, managing different stages like shipping, payment, order summary, and discount application.
3.  **Environment-Specific Configurations:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file clearly demonstrates an environment-driven configuration strategy, defining different API endpoints and tokens based on `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, and `local` environments. This is also reflected in the `merchant.html` `merchantInfo.environment` variable.
4.  **Analytics Integration:** Several files (especially `merchant/Merchant.svelte` and `common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`) show extensive integration with various third-party analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, edgetag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds). This indicates a strong focus on tracking user behavior and checkout performance.
5.  **Cookie and LocalStorage Management:** The `merchant/Merchant.svelte` and `common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts` files actively read from and write to cookies and local storage for session management, tracking IDs (e.g., `_shopify_s`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, `gk_landing_page`), and user information.
6.  **Discount and Offer Complexity:** The discount system appears robust, handling various types of discounts (automatic, coupon-based, stacked, loyalty, gift cards, partner offers like CredPay and Gyftr) and their interactions. This is particularly evident in `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `Discounts/Discounts.svelte`.
7.  **Frequent Iteration/Saving:** The multiple identical or near-identical timestamps for `/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`, `/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte`, `/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`, and `/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` indicate a pattern of frequent saving during active development or debugging, possibly due to Svelte's reactivity model or the iterative nature of UI development.
8.  **Merchant-Specific Configuration:** The `merchant.html` and `merchant/Merchant.svelte` files contain hardcoded or dynamically retrieved merchant IDs (`mid`) and environment settings, suggesting a white-label or adaptable checkout solution for various merchants.
9.  **Truecaller Integration:** The `merchant/Merchant.svelte` file specifically includes `truecallerConfig` for different environments, indicating integration with Truecaller for identity verification or login.

In summary, the changes reflect ongoing development of a comprehensive and highly integrated e-commerce checkout solution, with a strong emphasis on modularity (Svelte stores), external analytics, complex discount logic, and adaptable merchant-specific configurations.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps:** `18/11/2025` with multiple entries (`12:22:24`, `12:23:52`, `12:24:20`, `12:24:44`, `12:25:25`)
    *   **Updates:** This is the main application component, orchestrating various sub-components and global state.
        *   **Extensive Store Management:** Imports a very large number of Svelte stores from both `LoginStore` and `CommonStore` to maintain global application state related to user login, cart, merchant info, UI, and various flags.
        *   **History API Handling:** Implements `window.onpopstate` to manage navigation and display confirmation popups when the user attempts to exit the checkout flow.
        *   **Message Listener (`window.addEventListener('message')`):** Processes `launch` messages from the parent window, setting up initial application state (source values, local storage, environment, merchant info, cookies, etc.).
        *   **Token Retrieval Logic:** Includes logic to retrieve `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` from `localStorage` or cookies, with fallback mechanisms for incognito mode.
        *   **Gift Auto-Popup:** Introduces logic to automatically show a free gift selection popup if `gifts_available` and `auto_open_freebie_popup` are configured.
        *   **Numerous Imports:** The number of imported components and services is very high, indicating a complex application structure.
        *   **Repetitive Saves:** Several entries for this file on `18/11/2025` are identical, pointing to frequent file saves without substantive code changes between them.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Svelte Store Reliance:** A strong pattern across almost all `.svelte` and `.ts` files is the heavy use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_discountAmount`, `store_requestIdObject`, `store_merchantInfo`) for managing application state. This suggests a highly reactive and centralized state management architecture.
2.  **Environment-Based Configuration:** `EnvironmentService.ts` clearly dictates that various API endpoints and configurations are dynamically selected based on the `env` variable (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`), highlighting a robust multi-environment deployment strategy.
3.  **Analytics Integration:** Many files, especially `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`, and `Merchant.svelte`, are concerned with tracking user behavior and events for various analytics platforms (Facebook, GA, Contlo, Snapchat, etc.). This indicates a focus on data collection and user journey analysis.
4.  **Discount and Offer Complexity:** The discount logic is highly intricate, involving automatic discounts, stacked discounts, gift cards, loyalty programs, partner acquisition offers (Cred, TwidPay, Gyftr), and dynamic configurations from `requestIdObject`. There's continuous refinement of how discounts are applied, displayed, and removed.
5.  **Checkout Flow Management:** Components like `PaymentOptions.svelte` and `App.svelte` actively manage the checkout flow, including payment method selection, address handling, COD confirmations, and navigation (e.g., `window.onpopstate`).
6.  **Cookie and Local Storage Usage:** Cookies and `localStorage` are frequently accessed and manipulated to store user-specific data, session IDs, tokens, and tracking information across sessions.
7.  **Iterative Development / Frequent Saves:** The presence of many identical or near-identical entries for the same file on the same day (especially `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`, `Merchant.svelte`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`, `App.svelte`) suggests an active development phase with frequent saving, or an automated process that logs changes very granularly.
8.  **Error Handling and UI Feedback:** `manageErrorMessages` and `snackbar_state` indicate a system for providing user feedback on errors, and `try-catch` blocks are used for robustness.
9.  **Feature Flags/Custom Configs:** The `requestIdObject?.custom_config` is a recurring element, enabling dynamic feature flags and configurations for merchants, allowing for flexible behavior without code changes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Svelte Store Reliance**: Almost all files extensively use Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_requestIdObject`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_discountAmount`) for managing application state, enabling reactive updates and centralized data flow. This indicates a strong Svelte framework adherence.
2.  **Environment-Specific Configurations**: The `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` files consistently show logic for adapting to different deployment environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production). This includes API endpoints, merchant IDs, and Truecaller keys.
3.  **Analytics Integration**: Multiple files, especially `ForeignAnalytics.ts` and `Merchant.svelte`, are heavily involved in integrating various third-party analytics platforms (Facebook, Google Analytics, Snapchat, Contlo, etc.). Events are logged at different stages of the checkout flow.
4.  **Discount and Offer Management**: A significant portion of changes revolves around discount logic, including automatic discounts, stacked discounts, gift cards, loyalty programs, and partner acquisition offers. The complexity of these interactions is high, leading to frequent refinements in `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `Discounts.svelte`.
5.  **Frequent Micro-Updates**: Many files, particularly Svelte components like `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`, and `Merchant.svelte`, have multiple commits within a short timeframe (minutes). This suggests iterative development, debugging, and minor adjustments rather than large feature implementations.
6.  **Debugging and Logging**: There are instances of `console.log` being added and removed or modified, particularly in `EnvironmentService.ts`, `merchant.html`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`, and `Promotion.svelte`. This indicates active debugging during the development process.
7.  **Cookie and Local Storage Management**: Handling of browser cookies and local storage (e.g., `_shopify_s`, `gk_landing_page`, `goKwikToken`, `kp-login-no`) is a recurring theme, especially in `Merchant.svelte`, to persist user and session data.
8.  **Responsive Design Considerations**: `Discounts.svelte` explicitly filters available coupons based on `$store_screen_width < 600`, indicating attention to mobile responsiveness. `App.svelte` also uses `setViewProperties(parentWidth)` to adapt the view.
9.  **Feature Flags/Experimentation**: The presence of `store_discountExperimentFlag`, `store_paymentsUiExperiment`, `store_upiDesktopQrExperiment`, `store_sbiEmiExperiment`, and `store_addConfirmationStepExperiment` indicates the use of feature flags or A/B testing to control different UI/logic variants.
10. **Prepaid/COD Logic**: Consistent logic related to cash-to-prepaid conversions, COD charges, and confirmations is visible across `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `OrderSummary.svelte`, and `App.svelte`.

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx`** (Timestamp: 16/11/2025, 13:10:34)
    *   This file introduces a `BrandPage` component for customizing the checkout UI, specifically for logo uploads and primary theme color selection.
    *   It features client-side image validation (type and size), cleaning images with `cleanImageWithCanvas`, generating unique image paths, obtaining presigned S3 URLs, and uploading logos to AWS using `makeAWSPutCall`.
    *   API interactions (`makeAPICall`, `APIEndPoints`) are used for fetching existing logos and updating merchant configurations.
    *   The UI includes an upload button, an image preview, and a color picker component. A "Save Changes" button is dynamically enabled/disabled based on form modifications using the `isVisible` state.
    *   Redux is integrated to manage logo and brand data updates (`updatedLogoData`, `updateBrandData`).

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`** (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:22:51)
    *   A reusable `ProductSearch` component has been updated to provide advanced search functionality for Shopify products or collections.
    *   Key features include:
        *   Infinite scrolling (`useIntersectionObserver`) for search results.
        *   Support for product collation (grouping variants under a single product).
        *   Quantity management for selected items.
        *   Special handling for "Agent led" products (filtering items with 'no-agent' tag) and "Top Up Gift" pricing.
        *   Validation for collection quantities (`collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity`).
    *   It uses `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` for data retrieval and `gokwik-ui-kit` components for its modal-based search interface.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx`** (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:23:04)
    *   This file represents a comprehensive order details page with significant enhancements.
    *   **Refund Logic:** Implements robust logic for managing refunds, including merging repeated refund attempts, calculating the total refundable amount from transactions, and disabling the refund button based on various conditions (e.g., already refunded amounts, COD orders with store credits).
    *   **Price Breakup:** Detailed calculations are performed for various price components, including `total_discount` (summing multiple discount types like ABC, C2P, payment offers, loyalty points, Shopify, automatic, custom), `tax`, `shipping_and_cod_charges`, and `gift_card_and_rewards`.
    *   **Currency Handling:** Includes a global currency symbol setter (`setCurrencySymbol`) based on order data or merchant configuration, and a custom formatter (`formatAmountWithCurrency`) to ensure correct currency display.
    *   **UI Elements:** Displays order status, customer information (masked phone/email), transaction details, refund history, and various price breakups using a tabbed interface. Dynamic "Edit Order" button disabling based on rewards or specific discount types.
    *   Integrates with internal APIs (`APIEndPoints`, `makeAPICall`) and Redux for order data.

4.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`** (Timestamp: 18/11/2025, 00:45:31)
    *   This is the entry point for the dashboard micro-frontend application, using `single-spa` and SystemJS import maps.
    *   **Environment-Specific Micro-frontends:** It dynamically loads various `@gokwik` micro-frontends (e.g., `configuration`, `utilities`, `dashboard`, `checkout`, `payment`, `kwikpass`, `rto`, `kwikship`, `ellora`, `checkout-platform`, `shopify-app`, `kwikcomm`) based on the `deployedEnv` (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production). Local development points to `localhost` for configuration and checkout, while others use respective dev/qa/sandbox domains. `kwikcomm` has been added for dev and qa environments.
    *   **Analytics & Monitoring (Production):** For the production environment, it integrates `Microsoft Clarity` for user behavior analytics and `New Relic` for comprehensive browser performance monitoring, indicating a strong focus on production-grade observability.
    *   Standard HTML setup with meta tags, favicon, and shared React/ReactDOM dependencies via CDN.

5.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`** (Timestamps: 18/11/2025, 00:49:40, 18/11/2025, 00:50:14, 18/11/2025, 00:58:39)
    *   This file manages the UI and logic for configuring "Free Gift" rules.
    *   Users can create, edit, enable/disable, and delete free gift rules.
    *   Rules are defined by various criteria: sales channels (App, Web, Agent-led), purchase type (cart value, quantity), minimum/maximum values, applicability (all products, specific products/collections), the free product itself, free gift quantity/price, and application method (auto or customer selection with a limit).
    *   The `ProductSearch` component is utilized for selecting specific products or collections for gift applicability.
    *   `useMerchantConfigApi` is used to persist these free gift configurations.
    *   The file shows three identical entries, suggesting no functional code changes across these timestamps, possibly due to multiple save operations or automated formatting.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Timestamps:** All changes are clustered around mid-November 2025, indicating active development in a focused period.
*   **Gokwik UI Kit Adoption:** There's consistent and widespread use of components from `gokwik-ui-kit` across multiple files (`Button`, `Form`, `Input`, `Table`, `Card`, `message`, `Tooltip`, various icons), showcasing a standardized UI framework.
*   **Merchant Configuration Management:** The `useMerchantConfigApi` custom hook is a recurring pattern for interacting with and saving merchant-specific configurations, seen in both `brandPage.tsx` and `freeGift.tsx`.
*   **Redux for State Management:** `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch` are frequently used, indicating Redux (or a similar pattern) is a primary method for global and module-specific state management.
*   **API Interactions:** `makeAPICall`, `APIEndPoints`, and `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` are consistently used for backend communication, often with dynamic headers (e.g., `KwikCodLite` authorization).
*   **Form Handling:** React's `Form` component with `useForm`, `useWatch`, `setFieldValue`, and `getFieldsValue` is a common pattern for managing complex forms.
*   **Micro-frontend Architecture:** The `index.ejs` file clearly demonstrates a `single-spa` based micro-frontend setup, with dynamic loading of modules based on the deployment environment using import maps.
*   **Breadcrumb Management:** Functions like `updateBreadcrumbs` are used consistently to maintain navigation context across pages.
*   **Environment Variables:** The `.env` file (not summarized per instructions, but noted) and the use of `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` throughout the code confirm the reliance on environment-specific configurations for API endpoints.
*   **Analytics and Performance Monitoring:** The production environment in `index.ejs` prioritizes integration with third-party tools (Microsoft Clarity, New Relic) for user behavior analysis and application performance monitoring.

The provided log details code changes across various files within a `gokwik.pdp` project, primarily focusing on checkout, payment, discount, and analytics functionalities.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`
    *   **Timestamp:** `12/11/2025, 21:20:24` and `15/11/2025, 12:00:15`
    *   **Key Changes:** This file handles the logic for applying and processing shipping discounts and other promotions.
        *   It imports a large number of Svelte stores (from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore`) to manage application state related to cart, discounts, shipping, payments, and user information.
        *   Initializes numerous reactive variables by subscribing to these stores.
        *   `callShippingDiscountApi` is the core function for making discount/shipping API calls, including logic for clearing API timers and triggering confetti animation upon successful discount application (specifically for `shopify_based_cohort` or `csv_based_cohort` discounts, or when `show_discount_confetti` is enabled).
        *   Includes specific handling for Gyftr discounts (removing/reapplying) based on the `currentPage` and `placeOrder` status.
        *   Logs `loyalty_points_applied` events with details like provider, redeemed credits, and auto-application status.
        *   `processShippingDiscountResponse` further processes the API response, updating shipping methods, discount details, and handling gift card reapplication on cart updates (a fix for `CHECKOUT-15842`).
        *   Also addresses `CHECKOUT-12982` related to `callPaymentMethods` and `skipToPayment` logic.
        *   Adds logic to exclude error messages for UTM auto-application failures.
        *   Introduces a `processDiscountShippingQueue` to handle API responses asynchronously.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`
    *   **Timestamp:** `13/11/2025, 14:31:15`, `15/11/2025, 11:32:02`, `15/11/2025, 11:32:38`, `17/11/2025, 13:02:34`, `17/11/2025, 22:33:16`, `17/11/2025, 23:34:43`
    *   **Key Changes:** This service manages environment-specific URLs for various GoKwik APIs and resources.
        *   Subscribes to `store_merchanturl`, `store_environment`, and `store_cashToPrepaid` to set global `merchantUrl`, `env`, and `cashToPrepaid` variables.
        *   Provides functions like `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `getCredUrl`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`, `merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`, and `proxy_service_url` which return different base URLs based on the current `env` (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).
        *   There are frequent small modifications to the `api_url` function's `local` environment URL assignment, commenting out and uncommenting different API endpoints for local development. This indicates active testing or switching between various local backend configurations.
        *   The `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` functions dynamically return session token names based on the environment.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`
    *   **Timestamp:** `13/11/2025, 14:31:36`, `15/11/2025, 11:32:20`, `17/11/2025, 13:01:29`, `17/11/2025, 22:33:43`, `17/11/2025, 23:35:35`
    *   **Key Changes:** This is a static HTML file used for merchant integration and testing the GoKwik SDK.
        *   It defines `gokwikSdk` which handles SDK initialization, payment processing, event listeners, and a `hideButton` function.
        *   Sets up cookie management functions (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) for tracking landing page and referrer.
        *   Initializes `window.merchantInfo` with `mid`, `environment`, `storeId`, and `fbpixel`.
        *   Contains commented-out `mid` values for different environments (qa, neemans, bsc, etc.), indicating frequent switching for testing purposes.
        *   The `environment` in `window.merchantInfo` is consistently set to `'local'`.
        *   There are small, repeated changes to the `mid` value within the `window.merchantInfo` object in the script, specifically changing the commented-out `mid` for `qa` or adding new `mid` values like `eey3k3mkrg55tcs`, `19g6jlssscg1r`, `19g6im5qdaj7w`. This suggests active development and testing of merchant integrations across different instances.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte`
    *   **Timestamp:** `13/11/2025, 20:56:52` through `13/11/2025, 21:25:07`, and `15/11/2025, 12:01:15`
    *   **Key Changes:** This Svelte component manages the payment options screen.
        *   Imports a vast array of Svelte stores from both `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`, and `CommonStore` to handle payment-related state.
        *   Many variables are declared to hold subscribed store values (e.g., `totalPrice`, `screen_width`, `codChargesText`).
        *   On mount, it logs GTM and Shopify analytics events for `payment_step_landed`.
        *   Processes saved cards and retrieves previously used UPI IDs.
        *   Handles `skipToPayment` logic and conditionally calls `callPaymentMethods`.
        *   Manages various unsubscribe functions for store subscriptions.
        *   Includes logic for TwidPay, Shopify Store Credit, and COD confirmation.
        *   Filters and reorders `availableAutoOffers` based on payment methods.
        *   The most recent change (`15/11/2025, 12:01:15`) adds imports `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` from `CommonStore`, and two new components `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney`. This indicates a new feature or improvement related to free gift handling during the payment process. Also removes `calculateLoadTime` and `debounce` imports.
        *   Many consecutive changes to this file on `13/11/2025` with identical code suggest reformatting or minor whitespace changes rather than functional alterations.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`
    *   **Timestamp:** `15/11/2025, 11:49:48` and `15/11/2025, 11:52:44`
    *   **Key Changes:** This component handles the display and logic for the order summary.
        *   Imports various stores related to cart, discounts, shipping, and loyalty.
        *   Calculates `totalPrice` reactively based on many factors, including coupons, loyalty, gift cards, COD charges, and GST.
        *   `handleCartUpdate` function processes cart items, identifies free products (BXGY offers), and updates `subTotal`.
        *   Includes logic for loyalty display amount calculation based on `priceBreakUpData`.
        *   The content of the two commits is identical, suggesting a save without functional changes.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`
    *   **Timestamp:** `14/11/2025, 13:55:06` through `18/11/2025, 15:14:20`
    *   **Key Changes:** This is the main Svelte component for the merchant-side integration of the GoKwik checkout.
        *   Initializes various global variables (`mid`, `url`, `environment`, `cartObject`, `token`, etc.) that hold merchant and user-specific information.
        *   Manages cookie handling (`setCookie`, `getCookie`) for tracking and session management, including `_shopify_s`, `_scid`, `gk_utm_source`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, `discount_code`, `gk_landing_page`, `SP_DUID`, `gk_orig_referrer`, `_shopify_y`, `_shopify_sa_t`, `kp_user_id`, `KWIKUSERTOKEN`, `kpmclid`, and Google Analytics cookies.
        *   Sets up message listeners for communication with the main application (e.g., `merchantInfo`, `cartOpen`, `checkoutHealth`).
        *   Includes logic for Truecaller integration (`truecallerConfig`).
        *   Dynamically inserts CSS keyframes and dispatches `gokwikLoaded` event.
        *   Detects `isGlanceEnvironment`, `iosSafari`, `isAndroid`.
        *   Handles URL parameters for `mrid`, `gkref`, `src`, `ch`, `kwik`, `ScCid`, `isSameWindowRedirection`, `isSuccess`, `gokwikOid`, `so_token`, and `gk_token`.
        *   The numerous commits (`17/11/2025, 13:00:33` to `18/11/2025, 15:14:20`) primarily involve adding a `cookieSessionToken` variable and attempting to assign `tokenData?.coreToken` to it within the `if (queryParam.get('gk_token'))` block. This suggests efforts to debug or refine session token handling when a token is provided via URL parameters. The variable `backupToken` was introduced at `17/11/2025, 17:38:18` but then renamed to `cookieSessionToken` at `17/11/2025, 18:14:56`.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts`
    *   **Timestamp:** `17/11/2025, 13:05:00` through `17/11/2025, 14:14:00`
    *   **Key Changes:** This file handles integration with the Contlo analytics SDK.
        *   Defines a dummy `window.contlo` object with `init`, `identify`, `track`, and `push` methods for logging purposes, indicating that the actual Contlo SDK is expected to be loaded externally.
        *   `createBody` function constructs a standard data payload for Contlo events, including cart details, promo code, marketing data (landing page, UTM params), and user address info.
        *   `callContlo` acts as a dispatcher for different event types (`mobileAddedGK`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentCompleted`, `userAddress`, `coupon_applied_success_gk`, `coupon_applied_failed_gk`).
        *   Each event-specific function (`contloMobile`, `contloPincode`, etc.) creates a tailored data object and calls `contloSendEvent`.
        *   `contloSendEvent` wraps the call to `window.contlo.sendEvent` with a `try-catch` block to handle cases where the SDK might not be loaded.
        *   The changes from `17/11/2025, 13:05:00` to `17/11/2025, 14:14:00` show a refinement in how `cart_total_price` is determined in the `createBody` function. Initially, it directly used `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount`. Later updates add a check to ensure `cart_after_discount` is a valid number (`!isNaN(Number(...))`) and falls back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price` if it's not. This improves robustness in handling numerical data for analytics.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`
    *   **Timestamp:** `17/11/2025, 12:56:56` through `17/11/2025, 14:05:25` and `17/11/2025, 13:43:21`, `17/11/2025, 13:44:00`, `17/11/2025, 13:44:52`, `17/11/2025, 14:05:25`, `17/11/2025, 13:55:47`
    *   **Key Changes:** This file centralizes the logic for sending data to various third-party analytics platforms.
        *   Imports numerous Svelte stores (from `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`, `CommonStore`) to gather comprehensive data about the user, cart, order, and checkout process.
        *   Declares many local variables to store subscribed values, including `cart`, `risk_flag`, `coupon`, `phoneNumber`, `currency`, `userAddress`, `shippingMethod`, `paymentMethod`, `request_id`, `merchantInfo`, `shopifyCustomerId`, `ga4Id`, `google_ads_enhanced_tracking`, `snapchatAttributes`, `localStorageObject`, `finalPayablePrice`, `analyticsPixelObj`, `countryCode`, `gift_card_total`, `twidpayReward`, `gyftrAmount`, `discountBasedRewards`, `source`, `fbExternalId`, `kpFbCliId`, `kpUserToken`, `shopId`, `configObject`, `enableSku`, `ga4S2sEnabled`, `clevertapS2SEnabled`, `priceBreakup`, `kwikOptimizerPixelIds`, `shopifySessionId`, `timestamp`, `addressFound`, `editPartialAddress`, `fbPixelEventsAndKeys`, `marketingData`, `pageNumber`, `mobileApp`, `isPpcod`, `isTotalPayableAmount`.
        *   Subscribes to all relevant stores to keep its internal state updated.
        *   `createDataObject` and `generateTrackingData` (not shown in detail but implied by usage) are key for preparing data for analytics.
        *   Includes specific logic for Snapchat pixel events, prefilled address status, and UTM parameter mapping.
        *   Consolidates a `priceBreakup` object to standardize financial data for analytics.
        *   The repeated commits on `17/11/2025` seem to mostly involve minor refactorings or re-saving without significant functional code changes. One notable change (`17/11/2025, 13:55:47`) introduces a `console.log(res)` in the `store_totalPrice.subscribe` block, likely for debugging purposes.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/Promotion.svelte`
    *   **Timestamp:** `17/11/2025, 22:38:42`
    *   **Key Changes:** This Svelte component displays promotional text related to loyalty points, store credits, and gift cards.
        *   It reacts to changes in `store_requestIdObject`, `store_page`, `store_enableGiftCard`, `store_gyftr`, and `store_useStoreCredit`.
        *   Dynamically constructs `loyaltyDiscountText` based on whether credits, gift cards, loyalty points, or Gyftr are enabled and the current page number.
        *   The rendered output includes `JSON.stringify` calls for debugging `store_enableGiftCard`, `loyaltyEnabled`, `creditsEnabled`, and `gyftrEnabled` variables.
        *   Applies styling for the discount text wrapper.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`
    *   **Timestamp:** `17/11/2025, 23:52:04` through `18/11/2025, 12:45:43`
    *   **Key Changes:** This component handles the discount and offer application logic.
        *   Imports numerous stores related to cart, discounts, payments, and user state.
        *   Manages the state of `couponField`, `discountInput`, `discountCouponApplied`, `creditsApplied`, `storeCreditAvailable`, `cartAutoDiscount`, `showViewOffers`, `showOffersListing`, `showGiftCardInput`, and `disableGiftCards`.
        *   Calculates `allAppliedOffers` based on automatic discounts, stacked discounts, manual coupon application, and partner acquisition offers (e.g., Cred).
        *   Includes `onMount` logic to subscribe to various stores (`requestIdObject`, `reapplyEr`, `stackedDiscounts`, `offers`) to react to changes in discount configurations, loyalty, and offers.
        *   Calls `removeCredits`, `getStoreCredits`, `removeCoupon`, `applyCredits`, `removeDiscountBasedRewards`, `reapplyGiftCards`, `removeGiftCard` from relevant services.
        *   The numerous commits over a short period (`17/11/2025, 23:52:04` to `18/11/2025, 12:45:43`) show frequent re-saving with no apparent functional changes. This could indicate a developer saving work in progress or reformatting. The last few changes are identical.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`
    *   **Timestamp:** `18/11/2025, 12:22:24` through `18/11/2025, 12:40:55`, and `18/11/2025, 12:23:52`, `18/11/2025, 12:24:20`, `18/11/2025, 12:24:44`, `18/11/2025, 12:25:25`
    *   **Key Changes:** This is the root Svelte component of the application, managing the overall checkout flow and global state.
        *   Imports an extensive list of Svelte stores from both `LoginStore` and `CommonStore` to manage application-wide state.
        *   Initializes variables like `currentPage`, `orderType`, `abcError`, `loaderArray`, `primaryColor`, `isAbandonCart`, `confirmExit`, `cartObject`, `enableExtraAutomaticDiscounts`, `dynamicAutomaticExtraDiscounts`, `mobileView`, `desktopView`, `isSkipOtp`, `discountAnimation`, `cashToPrepaid`, `soToken`, `isPartnerAcquisionViewOfferApplied`, `discountBody`, `enableOverwriteAutomaticDiscounts`, `dynamicAutomaticOverwriteDiscounts`, `token`, `kwikpassToken`, `parentWidth`, `kpEmail`, `isCookieDiscountApplicable`, `isTwidAvailable`, `allAddress`, `isEmailFromKpEditable`, `redirectionFlowInfo`, `checkoutAnywhereDiscountCode`, `utmHeadlessParams`, `isNotIncognito`.
        *   Sets up `window.onpopstate` listener for handling browser back button events, implementing complex logic for navigation based on `currentPage`, popups, and loaders.
        *   Subscribes to `store_isLoggedInUser` to trigger a free gift popup if available.
        *   Subscribes to `store_confirmClose` to show a confirmation popup on exit.
        *   Handles `message` events from the parent window (`gokwikEvent.data.type === 'launch'`) to initialize various application parameters (source values, local storage, environment info, session IDs, cookies, etc.).
        *   Includes logic for detecting incognito mode due to `localStorage` limitations.
        *   The repeated commits on `18/11/2025` with seemingly identical code for this large file indicate frequent saving without functional changes, or minor reformatting.

*   `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/kwik-checkout.html`
    *   **Timestamp:** `18/11/2025, 14:49:20` through `18/11/2025, 14:58:58`
    *   **Key Changes:** This HTML file serves as the entry point for the Kwik checkout integration, particularly for app-based flows.
        *   Contains a JavaScript block to `fetchCart` details from a Shopify API endpoint.
        *   `initKwikCheckout` function is responsible for dynamically loading integration scripts (`merchant.integration.js`) and various analytics pixels (Facebook, Google Analytics, WebEngage, MoEngage) based on `storeInfo`.
        *   `createScript`, `createFbPixel`, `createGoogleAnalytics`, `createMoEngage`, `createWebEngage` are helper functions for injecting these scripts into the document head.
        *   Sets up listeners for messages from the iframe, handling `checkoutHealth` and `shopifyRedirect` events to potentially trigger a fallback.
        *   Handles URL parameters (`storeInfo`, `kp_email`, `utmParams`) to initialize merchant and user data, and set relevant cookies.
        *   The changes on `18/11/2025` from `14:49:20` to `14:58:58` primarily involve adding a `try-catch` block around the `atob(kpEmail)` call when parsing `kp_email` from URL parameters, and also adds `window.__KP_EMAIL__ = kpEmail;` outside the `try-catch` at `18/11/2025, 14:50:49` and `18/11/2025, 14:51:01` to ensure `kpEmail` is always set. This is a defensive programming measure to handle potential errors if `kp_email` is not base64 encoded as expected.

### General Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Svelte Store-based State Management:** A prominent pattern is the extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) from `CommonStore`, `OrderStore`, and `LoginStore` across almost all `.ts` and `.svelte` files. This indicates a highly reactive and centralized state management architecture. Variables are often declared and then subscribed to these stores to keep their values up-to-date.
2.  **Analytics Integration:** There's a strong emphasis on analytics and event logging. Multiple files (`ShippingDiscount.service.ts`, `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Merchant.svelte`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`, `App.svelte`) include calls to `fireGtmEvent`, `logEvent`, `stabilityEvent`, and specific analytics platforms (Facebook, Shopify, Contlo, Google Analytics, WebEngage, MoEngage, etc.). This suggests a comprehensive tracking strategy for user behavior and checkout funnel performance.
3.  **Environment-Specific Configurations:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` files show a clear pattern of managing different API endpoints and configurations based on the deployment environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production). This is crucial for development, testing, and production deployments.
4.  **Discount and Payment Logic:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around discount application, processing, and payment options. This includes handling various discount types (automatic, stacked, partner acquisition, gift cards, loyalty points, Gyftr) and payment flows (COD, UPI, card payments).
5.  **User Experience Features:** Elements like confetti animations (on successful discounts), popups for free gifts or exit confirmation, and dynamic UI updates (e.g., hiding PSP panels, showing limited payment options) point to an active effort to optimize user experience during checkout.
6.  **Defensive Programming and Debugging:** The inclusion of `try-catch` blocks, `console.log` statements (some commented out, some active), and repeated saves of identical code (especially in `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`, `App.svelte`, `Merchant.svelte`) suggest active development, debugging, and refactoring efforts. The `kp_email` parsing in `kwik-checkout.html` is a good example of adding robustness.
7.  **Asynchronous Operations and Queues:** The `createApiResponseQueue()` in `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` indicates the use of queuing mechanisms for API calls, likely to manage concurrent requests and maintain UI responsiveness.
8.  **Cookie and Local Storage Management:** Widespread use of cookies (`setCookie`, `getCookie`, `setCookieGk`, `getCookieGk`) and local storage (`localStorage.setItem`, `localStorage.getItem`) for persistent data, session management, and tracking.
9.  **Date Handling:** The timestamps indicate work occurring over several days (Nov 12-18, 2025), with bursts of activity, especially on Nov 13th and 17-18th. The rapid, minor changes to `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`, `App.svelte`, `Merchant.svelte`, and `Contlo.ts` often within minutes, suggest iterative development, testing, and refinement of specific features.

In summary, the changes reflect ongoing development in a checkout system, focusing on robust payment and discount processing, detailed analytics tracking, and flexible environment configuration, with particular attention to user experience elements like popups and animations. The frequent small commits suggest an agile development workflow with continuous integration and testing.

    *   **Summary:** This Svelte component for the merchant interface received updates related to session management and token handling. Specifically, a `backupToken` variable was added, and the logic for setting `cookieSessionToken` (or `token`) from query parameters or local storage was modified to store `tokenData?.coreToken`. This suggests a focus on robust token persistence and retrieval. Also, `window.merchantInfo.cashToPrepaid` logic was added to handle cash-to-prepaid configurations.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 17/11/2025, 13:05:00 to 17/11/2025, 14:14:00 (multiple changes)
    *   **Summary:** This analytics integration file focuses on sending events to Contlo. Initial changes involved adding a dummy `window.contlo` object for console logging, suggesting development/testing of the integration. Subsequent updates refined the `createBody` function, specifically how `cart_total_price` is determined, adding a check for `!isNaN(Number(commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount))` to ensure it's a valid number. `console.log(dataObj)` was temporarily added for debugging `contloAddressAdded`.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 18/11/2025, 12:22:24 to 18/11/2025, 12:40:55 (multiple changes)
    *   **Summary:** This is the main application component. Recent changes include extensive updates to import statements, adding new stores like `store_isLoggedInUser`, `store_fullScreenPopUp`, `store_trustBannerData`, `store_isReFetchAddress`, `store_additionalAddress`, etc. It also includes new components (`AutomaticGiftHeader`, `GiftJourney`). The `onpopstate` event handler for browser back/forward navigation was updated with complex conditional logic for closing popups and modals based on the current page and specific store states (e.g., `store_adoncLoader`, `store_popupState`, `store_bottomSheetState`). A new `logEvent` call for `checkout_assets_loaded` was added (duplicated in one instance).

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/kwik-checkout.html`**
    *   **Timestamps:** 18/11/2025, 14:49:20 to 18/11/2025, 14:58:58 (multiple changes)
    *   **Summary:** This HTML file, likely a checkout iframe or separate page, received updates to the `initListeners` function for handling messages (`checkoutHealth`, `shopifyRedirect`, `hardwareBackPress`). The `DOMContentLoaded` listener was updated to parse `storeInfo` and `kp_email` from URL parameters. A new `try-catch` block was added when parsing `kp_email` from URL params to handle potential errors during `atob()` decoding, ensuring `window.__KP_EMAIL__` is set even if decoding fails.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/Promotion.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 22:38:42

    *   **Summary:** This Svelte component for discounts saw substantial updates. New imports were added, notably `store_experimentalDiscountPopup`. The `$:` reactive statement for `allAppliedOffers` was extensively rewritten to consolidate various discount types (automatic, stacked, coupon field, partner acquisition offers) into a single array, along with their removability logic. The `onMount` lifecycle hook was updated to subscribe to `store_reapplyEr` for handling credit reapplication and `store_offers` for processing partner offers and filtering available coupons based on screen width.

### General Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Svelte Store Integration:** A dominant pattern is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state across different components. Almost every file extensively imports and subscribes to numerous common and order-specific stores (`CommonStore`, `OrderStore`, `LoginStore`). This indicates a highly reactive and centralized state management architecture.

2.  **Analytics and Event Logging:** Many files, especially `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Merchant.svelte`, and `App.svelte`, include extensive event logging (`logEvent`, `fireGtmEvent`, `fireAnalytics`, `post...Message`) for various analytics platforms (Facebook, Google Analytics, Snapchat, Contlo, CleverTap, etc.). This suggests a strong focus on tracking user behavior and checkout funnel performance.

3.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file clearly shows the need for different API endpoints and tokens based on the deployment environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`). This is a common pattern in multi-environment deployments.

4.  **Discount and Offer Management:** There's a continuous theme of managing complex discount logic, including auto-application, stacking, loyalty programs, gift cards, and partner acquisition offers. The `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` files are central to this.

5.  **Checkout Flow Control:** The `App.svelte` and `PaymentOptions.svelte` files demonstrate intricate logic for controlling the checkout flow, including navigation (popstate), loading states, and conditional rendering of UI elements based on various application states (e.g., `currentPage`, `skipToPayment`, `bottomSheetState`).

6.  **Iterative Refinement and Debugging:** Several entries show commented-out code or temporary `console.log` statements (e.g., `EnvironmentService.ts`, `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`), suggesting an ongoing development and debugging process. The frequent, small changes to specific parts of a function or variable declaration also point to this.

7.  **Cookie and Local Storage Usage:** Both `Merchant.svelte` and `kwik-checkout.html` interact extensively with browser cookies and local storage for persisting session information, user tokens, UTM parameters, and other checkout-related data.

8.  **Error Handling and User Experience:** There are explicit mentions of `manageErrorMessages`, `discountRetrySnackbar`, and logic to handle failed payments or checkout health issues, indicating a focus on graceful error handling and user feedback.

In summary, the changes reflect a mature project undergoing active development, with a strong emphasis on robust state management, extensive analytics integration, flexible environment configuration, complex discount logic, and a refined user checkout experience, alongside iterative debugging and code improvements.

    *   This service handles integration with various foreign analytics platforms (Facebook, Google Analytics, Snapchat, CleverTap, etc.).
    *   It subscribes to numerous stores to collect data about the cart, user, discounts, shipping, and other checkout events.
    *   It defines `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` for mapping Facebook pixel events.
    *   The `commonAnalyticsData` object is populated with marketing and cart-related information.
    *   The updates are mostly re-saves or minor formatting adjustments, but the recurring updates indicate active monitoring or configuration of analytics events. The `console.log(res)` for `store_totalPrice` on `17/11/2025, 13:44:52` suggests debugging efforts.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps: 17/11/2025, 13:05:00; 17/11/2025, 13:19:38; 17/11/2025, 13:45:19; 17/11/2025, 13:55:05; 17/11/2025, 14:07:01; 17/11/2025, 14:13:04; 17/11/2025, 14:13:49; 17/11/2025, 14:14:00**
    *   This file integrates with the Contlo analytics SDK.
    *   It defines a `contlo` dummy object for development/testing purposes, which logs calls to `init`, `identify`, `track`, and `push`.
    *   The `createBody` function constructs a standardized data object for Contlo events, including cart details, promo codes, product IDs, user address info, and UTM parameters.
    *   The `callContlo` function acts as a dispatcher for various checkout events (`mobileAddedGK`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentCompleted`, `userAddress`, `coupon_applied_success_gk`/`failed_gk`).
    *   A notable change on `17/11/2025, 14:07:01` and subsequent commits is the adjustment of `cart_total_price` in `createBody` to handle cases where `cart_after_discount` might be `NaN` or `null`, prioritizing `cart_after_discount` if valid, otherwise falling back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price`. This indicates a refinement in how cart total is reported to Contlo.
    *   The frequent minor changes and `console.log(data)` or `console.log(dataObj)` statements suggest active debugging of Contlo event data.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamps: 14/11/2025, 13:55:06; 17/11/2025, 13:00:33; 17/11/2025, 17:36:22; 17/11/2025, 17:38:18; 17/11/2025, 18:14:56; 17/11/2025, 18:16:05; 17/11/2025, 18:16:16; 17/11/2025, 18:25:21; 18/11/2025, 14:25:07; 18/11/2025, 15:10:51; 18/11/2025, 15:14:20**
    *   This is the main merchant integration Svelte component. It embeds the checkout iframe and handles communication with it.
    *   It manages various merchant-specific configurations, analytics integrations (CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, etc.), and event listeners.
    *   It contains logic for setting/getting cookies and local storage items related to user sessions, discounts, and analytics.
    *   A `truecallerConfig` object holds API keys for different environments.
    *   A `sessionIDFixMerchants` array is used for specific merchant IDs.
    *   Repeatedly, on `17/11/2025, 17:38:18` onwards, a `backupToken` variable (later renamed to `cookieSessionToken`) is introduced and populated with `tokenData?.coreToken`. This suggests an attempt to persist or manage session tokens more robustly.
    *   The numerous timestamps imply active development and testing of the core integration logic, particularly around session management and analytics data propagation. Many updates are re-saves or minor code restructuring without substantial functional changes visible in the provided snippets, except for the `cookieSessionToken` addition.

    *   **Timestamps: 18/11/2025, 14:49:20; 18/11/2025, 14:50:49; 18/11/2025, 14:51:01; 18/11/2025, 14:57:07; 18/11/2025, 14:57:19; 18/11/2025, 14:58:02; 18/11/2025, 14:58:58**
    *   This HTML file serves as the entry point for the Kwik checkout embedded within the merchant's site (likely an iframe).
    *   It initializes the `merchantInfo` object from URL parameters, loads integration scripts (`gokwikIntegration`, `analyticsJs`), and initializes various third-party pixels (Facebook, Google Analytics, MoEngage, WebEngage).
    *   The `fetchCart` function makes an XHR call to retrieve Shopify cart data.
    *   The `initListeners` function handles messages from the iframe and events like `gk-checkout-disable` for redirection.
    *   A significant change on `18/11/2025, 14:50:49` and `18/11/2025, 14:58:58` is related to how `kpEmail` is handled. Initially, `window.__KP_EMAIL__ = kpEmail;` was outside a `try...catch` block. It was then moved inside a `try...catch` on `18/11/2025, 14:58:58` to gracefully handle potential errors during `atob(kpEmail)` decryption, falling back to using `kpEmail` directly if decryption fails. This indicates a focus on robustness for handling email data from Kwikpass.
    *   Similar to other files, frequent re-saves or minor adjustments are common.

    *   This Svelte component is dedicated to managing discounts and offers.
    *   It heavily relies on Svelte stores for discount codes, drawer states, cart information, available offers, and various custom configurations from `requestIdObject`.
    *   It lists many types of discounts: automatic, stacked, partner acquisition (Cred), gift cards, loyalty points.
    *   It includes logic for displaying, applying, and removing coupons, and handling different discount scenarios (e.g., stacking, auto-apply, experiment flags).
    *   A reactive statement `$: loyaltyDisplayName = $store_requestIdObject?.custom_config?.loyalty_display_name;` and `$: isPromotionalDiscount();` are present, indicating dynamic UI updates.
    *   The `allAppliedOffers` computed property demonstrates complex logic for combining different types of applied discounts (automatic, stacked, manual coupon, partner offers) and includes removable flags and `onRemove` actions.
    *   The numerous timestamps on `18/11/2025` with no visible functional changes suggest very minor, non-functional edits, likely related to formatting or re-saves during intense development or review cycles, especially given the rapid succession of timestamps.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**

    *   This `App.svelte` file appears to be the root component of the checkout application.
    *   It orchestrates the display of different checkout pages (Address, Payment, OTP, Order, COD, Success, Error screens) based on the `currentPage` store.
    *   It extensively uses Svelte stores from both `LoginStore` and `CommonStore` to manage the global state of the application.
    *   It handles global event listeners like `window.onpopstate` for browser back/forward navigation, showing confirmation popups or navigating through the checkout flow.
    *   It listens for `message` events from the parent (merchant) window to launch the checkout with initial data.
    *   It includes logic for setting view properties (mobile/desktop), logging `checkout_assets_loaded` events, handling discount codes from cookies, and managing user tokens.
    *   The consistent pattern of updates here (multiple timestamps without visible code changes) again suggests frequent re-saves or minor adjustments during active development, potentially around the state management or event handling.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Svelte Store Reliance:** All `.svelte` and `.ts` files heavily rely on Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_requestIdObject`, `store_discountCode`) for state management and reactive programming. This is a core architectural pattern across the codebase.
2.  **Analytics Integration:** There's a strong emphasis on analytics, with multiple files (`ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Merchant.svelte`, `Contlo.ts`) integrating with various platforms (Facebook, Google Analytics, Snapchat, CleverTap, Klaviyo, WebEngage, MoEngage, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds). Many changes revolve around refining the data sent to these analytics services.
3.  **Environment-Specific Configurations:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file clearly demonstrates the need for different API and CDN endpoints based on the deployment environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`). This is a common pattern in multi-environment applications.
4.  **Discount and Offer Management:** A significant portion of the code is dedicated to handling complex discount and offer logic, including automatic discounts, stacked discounts, gift cards, loyalty points, and partner-specific offers (CredPay, Gyftr, TwidPay). This suggests a feature-rich and dynamic pricing system.
5.  **Checkout Flow Orchestration:** The `App.svelte` component acts as the central orchestrator, managing the overall checkout flow, navigation, and modal/bottom sheet interactions.
6.  **Frequent Minor Updates/Re-saves:** Many files, especially `.svelte` components and configuration services, show multiple timestamps within a short period with no discernable functional code changes in the provided snippets. This suggests a developer was actively working on these files, potentially making small formatting changes, saving frequently, or debugging, without introducing large new features in each commit.
7.  **Merchant-Specific Customization:** The `merchant.html` and `Merchant.svelte` files show configurations specific to individual merchants (e.g., `merchantInfo.mid`, `truecallerConfig` keys), indicating a platform designed to be customized for different clients.
8.  **Cookie and Local Storage Management:** Both `Merchant.svelte` and `kwik-checkout.html` actively manage cookies and local storage for persisting session data, user tokens, UTM parameters, and other checkout-related information.
9.  **Error Handling and Robustness:** There are explicit mentions of error handling (e.g., in `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` for invalid channels, in `kwik-checkout.html` for `kpEmail` decryption), suggesting efforts to make the checkout flow resilient.

* **Changes**: Both entries show identical code, indicating no functional change between these timestamps. The file is a Svelte service responsible for handling shipping and discount logic. It imports numerous stores (CommonStore, OrderStore, LoginStore) and other services (MerchantAPI, EventService, GiftCard.service, Discounts.service, Helper.service, ForeignAnalytics, PaymentOptions.service, Gyftr.service) to manage checkout flow.
    * It initializes various local variables by subscribing to Svelte stores, including `gstInfo`, `discountCode`, `shippingAsProduct`, `currentPage`, `giftCardData`, `selectedShippingMethod`, `discountBasedRewards`, `disable_discount_with_credits`, `auto_apply_credits`, `show_discount_confetti`, `freeGift`, and `billingAmount`.
    * The `callShippingDiscountApi` function initiates discount/shipping calls, clears API timers, and processes the response. It includes logic for triggering confetti animation on successful discount application (specifically for shopify/csv based cohorts or if `show_discount_confetti` is enabled and not in a redirection flow). It also handles removal and re-application of Gyftr discounts based on the `currentPage` and `placeOrder` status, and logs loyalty points application events.
    * The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function updates shipping methods, shipping options, and discount responses. It contains logic for re-applying gift cards if the cart has been modified, and for calling payment methods or showing a loader based on shipping options and `skipToPayment` configuration.
    * Error messages are managed, with exclusions for UTM auto-application failures.
    * It includes logic for retrying shipping method selection if a discount shipping retry is indicated and multiple shipping options are available.

    * **17/11/2025, 14:07:01**: The `cart_total_price` in `createBody` was updated to conditionally use `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount` if it's a valid number, otherwise fall back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price`. This change addresses potential `NaN` values. The debugging `console.log` in `contloAddressAdded` was removed.
    * **17/11/2025, 14:13:04**: The `cart_total_price` logic in `createBody` was slightly refined, using `discountedAmount` to explicitly check for `NaN` and ensure a number is used.
    * **17/11/2025, 14:13:49**: No functional change.

* **Timestamp**: 18/11/2025, 14:49:20, 18/11/2025, 14:50:49, 18/11/2025, 14:51:01, 18/11/2025, 14:57:07, 18/11/2025, 14:57:19, and 18/11/2025, 14:58:02
* **Changes**: This HTML file likely serves as an entry point for an embedded checkout experience.
    * **18/11/2025, 14:49:20**: Introduced `fetchCart` function to get cart data from a Shopify cart API, setting `merchantInfo.appCart` and `merchantInfo.appFlow`. Also introduced `initKwikCheckout` to dynamically load integration scripts and various pixel scripts (Facebook, Google Analytics, WebEngage, MoEngage) based on `storeInfo`. Includes `createScript`, `createFbPixel`, `createGoogleAnalytics`, `createMoEngage`, and `createWebEngage` functions for injecting these scripts. `initListeners` sets up message and DOMContentLoaded event handlers. It also handles `kp_email` from URL parameters.
    * **18/11/2025, 14:50:49**: `window.__KP_EMAIL___ = kpEmail;` was changed to `window.__KP_EMAIL__ = kpEmail;` within the `DOMContentLoaded` listener, correcting a typo.
    * **18/11/2025, 14:51:01**: No functional change.
    * **18/11/2025, 14:57:07**: No functional change.
    * **18/11/2025, 14:57:19**: No functional change.
    * **18/11/2025, 14:58:02**: Added a `try-catch` block around `kpEmail = atob(kpEmail)` in the `DOMContentLoaded` listener to handle potential base64 decoding errors for `kpEmail`.

### **Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Svelte Store Reliance:** All `.svelte` files heavily rely on Svelte's reactive `store` mechanism (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_requestIdObject`) for state management and data flow across components.
2.  **Environment-based Configuration:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` and `merchant.html` files show a clear pattern of configuring URLs and `merchantInfo` (especially `mid`) based on the development environment (`local`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.). This indicates a robust environment management strategy for deployment.
3.  **Analytics Integration:** Multiple files (`Merchant.svelte`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`, `merchant.html`, `kwik-checkout.html`) demonstrate extensive integration with various analytics platforms (Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics/GA4, WebEngage, MoEngage, Snapchat, Contlo, CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, Growlytics, Netcore, CustomerLabs, edgetag, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds). This suggests a strong focus on tracking user behavior and campaign performance.
4.  **Discount and Offer Management:** The `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` files show complex logic for handling discounts, including automatic discounts, stacked discounts, gift cards, loyalty points, and partner offers (like CredPay, Gyftr). There's a recurring theme of checking discount eligibility, applying/removing discounts, and logging related events.
5.  **Checkout Flow Orchestration:** The `App.svelte` and `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` files illustrate a detailed checkout flow, including steps for login, address selection, payment options, and order completion. Features like "skip to payment", "cash to prepaid", and "abandon cart" are explicitly handled.
6.  **Cookie and Local Storage Usage:** There's a consistent pattern of using cookies (`_shopify_s`, `_scid`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, `gk_utm_source`, `gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`, `KWIKUSERTOKEN`, `kpmclid`, `_ga` prefixes) and local storage (`kp-login-no`, `cash_to_prepaid`, tokens) for persisting user and session data across interactions.
7.  **Dynamic Script Loading:** Both `merchant.html` and `kwik-checkout.html` demonstrate dynamic injection of JavaScript and pixel tracking scripts based on configuration, allowing for flexible and modular integration of third-party services.
8.  **Debugging Practices:** Several entries include `console.log` statements or minor code changes (like the `console.log(res)` in `ForeignAnalytics.ts` or `console.log(dataObj)` in `Contlo.ts`) that are typical of debugging efforts during development.
9.  **Iterative Refinement**: Many files, especially Svelte components, show multiple timestamps with identical or very minor changes, which could indicate frequent saving during active development, or small, isolated fixes.

The changes log reveals a focused effort on enhancing the GoKwik dashboard's UI customization, order management, promotional tools, and core application monitoring.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx** (16/11/2025, 13:10:34): This update introduces a brand customization page allowing merchants to upload their logo and select a primary theme color for the checkout UI. It integrates with merchant configuration APIs and Redux for state management, providing functions for image validation, upload to AWS, and API calls to update merchant details. An `InfoComponent` was added for improved user guidance.
*   **/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx** (17/11/2025, 16:22:51): This file received significant updates, expanding its functionality for product and collection search within discount and free gift features. Key additions include support for agent-led filtering (excluding 'no-agent' tagged items), a "top-up gift" option with adjustable pricing, and comprehensive quantity management for collections, including validation to prevent exceeding set limits. New UI elements like `InputNumber` and `Tooltip` were integrated.
*   **/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx** (17/11/2025, 16:23:04): This update brings a major overhaul to the order details page. It introduces a sophisticated refund reconciliation system, detailed price breakup calculations (e.g., discounts, taxes, shipping, gift cards, rewards), and dynamic currency formatting. New UI components enhance the display of order status, failure reasons, and customer contact information (masked by default). Logic for enabling/disabling the refund button based on transaction status and amount has been improved, and the ability to set a disabled status for editing orders based on specific conditions (e.g., Twid rewards, loyalty points) was added.
*   **/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs** (18/11/2025, 00:45:31): This critical configuration file saw updates primarily focused on production monitoring and environment-specific module loading. For the `production` environment, New Relic Real User Monitoring (RUM) has been integrated with detailed configurations for performance tracking, distributed tracing, and session replay (including privacy-conscious data masking rules for inputs and selectors). Microsoft Clarity for analytics is also enabled. Additionally, `dev` and `qa` import maps now include `@gokwik/kwikcomm`, indicating the addition of a new communication module in these environments.
*   **/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx** (18/11/2025, 00:49:40, 00:50:14, 00:58:39): A new, robust feature for managing automatic free gift rules was introduced. Merchants can now create and edit rules based on purchase requirements (cart value or quantity), applicability (all products, specific products, or collections), and the method of gift addition (auto or customer selection with limits). The component includes a dynamic form with comprehensive validation and a table to display, enable/disable, edit, or delete these rules. The multiple identical timestamps suggest frequent save operations during active development of this feature.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **16/11/2025, 13:10:34:** Introduction of brand customization capabilities.
*   **17/11/2025, 16:22:51:** Major enhancements to product/collection search, particularly for discounts and gifts.
*   **17/11/2025, 16:23:04:** Extensive improvements and additions to the order details page functionalities, especially around refunds and price breakups.
*   **18/11/2025, 00:45:31:** Core dashboard configuration update, integrating New Relic RUM and Microsoft Clarity for production environments, and updating module imports.
*   **18/11/2025, 00:49:40:** Implementation of a comprehensive free gift settings management feature.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Feature Expansion Across Modules:** A consistent pattern of expanding dashboard functionalities is evident, covering merchant UI customization, promotional tools (discounts, free gifts), and core operational views (order details).
*   **Emphasis on Configuration and Customization:** Many updates revolve around providing merchants more control over their checkout experience and promotions through detailed configuration options and dynamic forms.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** The addition of `InfoComponent`, tooltips, and detailed form validations suggests a continuous effort to make the dashboard more intuitive and user-friendly.
*   **Deep Integration with APIs and State Management:** Frequent use of custom API hooks (`useMerchantConfigApi`), Redux for state management, and `makeAPICall` indicates a robust, interconnected architecture for data handling.
*   **Focus on Production Monitoring and Analytics:** The integration of New Relic RUM and Microsoft Clarity for `production` underscores a strong commitment to monitoring application performance and user behavior in live environments, with careful consideration for data privacy through masking.
*   **Consistent UI Framework:** The widespread use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components ensures a unified and consistent user interface across different parts of the dashboard.
*   **Multiple Consecutive Timestamps:** The repeated timestamps for `/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` indicate a period of rapid iteration or frequent saving on a specific feature.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts
*   **Timestamp:** 12/11/2025, 21:20:24 and 15/11/2025, 12:00:15
*   **Changes:** This file manages shipping discounts and offers.
    *   It imports a large number of stores (Svelte stores) from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage various checkout states and data, including discounts, shipping, cart details, gift cards, and user information.
    *   It defines numerous `let` variables, many of which are subscribed to these Svelte stores, indicating a reactive data flow.
    *   The `callShippingDiscountApi` function handles making API calls for discounts and shipping options. It includes logic for clearing API timers, applying confetti for valid discounts (especially for 'shopify_based_cohort' or 'csv_based_cohort' user types, and when `show_discount_confetti` is enabled and not in a redirection flow), and processing the API response.
    *   It includes conditional logic for handling Gyftr rewards (removing and reapplying based on `placeOrder` status and current page) and logging loyalty points application.
    *   The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function parses the API response to set shipping methods, shipping options, and discount responses.
    *   It contains logic for re-applying gift cards and updating TwidPay based on cart modifications.
    *   Error messages are managed, with specific exclusions for UTM auto-application failures.
    *   There's also logic for retrying shipping method selection based on `discount_shipping_retry` and `shippingOptions` length.
    *   The second timestamp (15/11/2025) shows no discernible content changes from the first, suggesting a re-save or minor, non-substantive change.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts
*   **Timestamp:** 13/11/2025, 14:31:15, 15/11/2025, 11:32:02, 15/11/2025, 11:32:38, 17/11/2025, 13:02:34, 17/11/2025, 22:33:16, 17/11/2025, 23:34:43
*   **Changes:** This file is responsible for determining API endpoints and other environment-specific configurations based on the current environment (`env`).
    *   It defines `merchantUrl`, `env`, and `cashToPrepaid` variables, subscribed to Svelte stores.
    *   It exports functions (`getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `getCredUrl`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`, `merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`, `proxy_service_url`, `XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that return different URLs or tokens based on the `env` variable (e.g., 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', 'local').
    *   There are frequent changes to the `api_url` function, specifically in the `local` environment block. This block contains several commented-out URLs, with one active URL, which changes across timestamps.
        *   **13/11, 14:31:15:** `url = 'https://api.gokwik.co';` for `local` env.
        *   **15/11, 11:32:02 & 15/11, 11:32:38:** `url = 'https://sandbox.gokwik.co';` for `local` env.
        *   **17/11, 13:02:34, 17/11, 22:33:16, 17/11, 23:34:43:** `url = 'https://api.gokwik.co';` for `local` env.
    *   The `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` functions return environment-specific tokens, e.g., 'SANDBOXKWIKSESSIONTOKEN', 'KWIKSESSIONTOKEN', 'QAKWIKSESSIONTOKEN'.
    *   Multiple timestamps for this file indicate frequent minor adjustments, likely related to environment setup or debugging, especially around the `local` environment configuration.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html
*   **Timestamp:** 13/11/2025, 14:31:36, 15/11/2025, 11:32:20, 17/11/2025, 13:01:29, 17/11/2025, 22:33:43, 17/11/2025, 23:35:35
*   **Changes:** This HTML file acts as a merchant integration page for the "gokwik" checkout SDK.
    *   It includes a `gokwikSdk` JavaScript IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) that handles SDK initialization, payment processing, event handling (`on`, `emit`), and UI manipulation (like hiding buttons).
    *   The `init` function dynamically loads `gokwik.js` from `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js`.
    *   It sets and gets `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` cookies.
    *   The `merchantInfo` object within the script tag defines various merchant-specific configurations, including `mid`, `environment`, `storeId`, and `fbpixel`.
    *   Frequent changes are observed in the `mid` configuration within the `window.merchantInfo` object, with different `mid` values being commented in/out or changed across different timestamps. This indicates active testing and switching between various merchant IDs, possibly for different testing environments or clients.
    *   The main functionality revolves around launching the `gokwikCheckout` by posting `merchantInfo` to the window.
    *   The file includes elements for a "Privy widget" and a "gokwik-div" where the checkout UI would likely be rendered.
    *   Multiple timestamps show changes primarily to the `mid` value in `window.merchantInfo`, confirming active development and testing of merchant integrations.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte
*   **Timestamp:** 13/11/2025, 20:56:52, 13/11/2025, 20:58:06, 13/11/2025, 21:00:07, 13/11/2025, 21:00:59, 13/11/2025, 21:01:56, 13/11/2025, 21:03:33, 13/11/2025, 21:20:47, 13/11/2025, 21:22:28, 13/11/2025, 21:23:51, 13/11/2025, 21:25:07, 15/11/2025, 12:01:15
*   **Changes:** This Svelte component manages the payment options screen in the checkout flow.
    *   It imports a vast number of Svelte stores from `LoginStore`, `OrderStore`, and `CommonStore` to manage payment-related states, discounts, cart information, user details, and UI configurations.
    *   It defines many `let` variables for component state, including `totalPrice`, `screen_width`, various flags (`getMethodres`, `usePartnerOfferCss`, `firstRun`, `firstRunForDiscount`, `upiMethodAvailable`, `codAvailable`, `showPaymentHeader`, `hidePspPanel`, `hideCredPay`, `isCodAvailable`, `showUpiCollect`, `codPaymentFailed`, `codPaymentPending`, `retryCodPayment`, `showLimitedPaymentMethods`, `showRecommendedMethods`, `showCODOnRecommended`), and data structures for methods, offers, and recommended options.
    *   The `onMount` lifecycle hook initiates several actions: setting `prepaidDiscount`, subscribing to `paymentMethods`, processing saved cards, logging GTM events, setting page name, initializing error states, and handling skip-to-payment flows.
    *   It subscribes to numerous stores to reactively update its state.
    *   Logic for applying TwidPay rewards and Shopify store credits is present, triggering `callPaymentMethods` when relevant.
    *   It logs events for "loyalty_points_applied", "payment_step_landed", "email_mismatch_message_shown", and "payment_step_bajajf_in_methods".
    *   It includes a reactive block (`$:`) that updates `store_onpl.isCodAvailable` based on `isTwidApplied`.
    *   A common pattern across multiple timestamps (e.g., 13/11/2025, 20:56:52 to 13/11/2025, 21:25:07) is that the code content remains almost identical, but there are additions to the imported stores list. Specifically, `store_availableOffersCheck` is added on 13/11/2025, 21:22:28.
    *   On 15/11/2025, 12:01:15, additional CommonStore imports are added: `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated`. Also, new components `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney` are imported. A new reactive block is added for `recommendedOptions?.isVisible` and `screen_width < 600`. This suggests new features related to free gifts, user login state, cart updates, and UI adjustments for recommended payment options on smaller screens.

*   **Timestamp:** 14/11/2025, 13:55:06, 17/11/2025, 13:00:33, 17/11/2025, 17:36:22, 17/11/2025, 17:38:18, 17/11/2025, 18:14:56, 17/11/2025, 18:16:05, 17/11/2025, 18:16:16, 18/11/2025, 14:25:07, 18/11/2025, 15:10:51, 18/11/2025, 15:14:20
*   **Changes:** This Svelte component represents the merchant-side integration logic.
    *   It imports numerous analytics services (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GAAnalytics, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, edgetag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds) indicating extensive third-party analytics integration.
    *   It defines various `let` variables to hold merchant-specific data, user information, and flags (`mid`, `url`, `environment`, `cartObject`, `token`, `sessionId`, `shopifySessionId`, `isAbandonCart`, `kpPhoneNumber`, `kpEmail`, `isSameWindowRedirection`, `isSuccess`, `gokwikOid`, `checkoutAnywhere`, `cookieSessionToken`).
    *   The `truecallerConfig` object contains different Truecaller keys for various environments (`local`, `dev`, `ndev`, `production`, `sandbox`, `qa`, `qatwo`).
    *   The `onMount` hook is a central point for initialization: inserting CSS keyframes, dispatching a `gokwikLoaded` event, checking the environment, and setting up message listeners.
    *   It handles the parsing of URL parameters (`mrid`, `gkref`, `kwik`, `ScCid`, `isSameWindowRedirection`, `isSuccess`, `gokwikOid`, `so_token`) to configure the checkout flow.
    *   It sets various cookies and local storage items related to Shopify session, UTM parameters, Facebook pixels (`_fbp`, `_fbc`), and Kwikpass tokens (`KWIKUSERTOKEN`, `kp-login-no`).
    *   The `launchApp` function is crucial, initiating the checkout with `merchantInfo`.
    *   Multiple timestamps show the addition of `backupToken` (17/11/2025, 17:38:18) and `cookieSessionToken` (17/11/2025, 18:14:56 onwards), and the handling of these tokens for persistence. This suggests an evolution in session management and token handling, possibly for improved reliability or tracking.
    *   The logic for handling `kpEmail` from URL parameters also changes to include a `try-catch` block (18/11/2025, 14:58:58 in `kwik-checkout.html`), which propagates back to `Merchant.svelte` as `window.__KP_EMAIL__` is set directly instead of decoding in some scenarios.
    *   Overall, the file indicates complex initialisation, analytics tracking, and environment-specific configurations.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte
*   **Timestamp:** 15/11/2025, 11:49:48, 15/11/2025, 11:52:44
*   **Changes:** This Svelte component is responsible for displaying the order summary and calculating the total price.
    *   It imports a wide array of Svelte stores related to login, common data, and order details (e.g., `store_cartjsObject`, `store_discountBasedRewards`, `store_prepaidDiscount`, `store_totalPrice`, `store_gyftr`).
    *   It calculates `totalPrice` reactively based on numerous factors: `subTotal`, `couponDiscount`, `partnerAcquisitionOffer`, `discountBasedRewards`, `shopifyStoreCredit`, `prepaidDiscount`, `shippingInfo`, `giftcardTotal`, `codCharges`, `twidPay`, `gstInfo`, and `gyftrAmount`. This is a complex calculation with many conditional checks.
    *   The `handleCartUpdate` function is critical for processing cart data, calculating automatic discounts, segregating free products (e.g., BXGY offers), and updating `subTotal`.
    *   It includes logic for displaying earned loyalty details and updating `loyaltyDisplayAmount`.
    *   The `onMount` hook sets up subscriptions to various stores and initializes page-specific display logic (`showNewOrderSummary`).
    *   No significant content changes between the two timestamps, indicating either minor non-code changes or re-saves.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts
*   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 12:56:56, 17/11/2025, 13:43:21, 17/11/2025, 13:44:00, 17/11/2025, 13:44:52, 17/11/2025, 14:05:25
*   **Changes:** This file aggregates and dispatches data to various third-party analytics services.
    *   It imports numerous Svelte stores to gather comprehensive data about the user's checkout journey, cart, discounts, and merchant configurations.
    *   It defines a large number of `let` variables to hold data points for analytics, such as `cart`, `risk_flag`, `coupon`, `phoneNumber`, `currency`, `userAddress`, `shippingMethod`, `paymentMethod`, `request_id`, `merchantInfo`, and various cookie-related identifiers (`fbp`, `fbc`, `shopifySessionId`, `fbExternalId`).
    *   A `priceBreakup` object is initialized and updated with details like `line_items_subtotal`, `order_total`, `total_discount`, `shipping_charges`, `cod_fee`, and `tax`.
    *   It maps `fbPixelEventsAndKeys` for Facebook pixel events.
    *   The `adSourceMapping` function processes UTM parameters from the source string.
    *   It has subscription logic for a multitude of stores (`store_discountAmount`, `store_page`, `store_codCharges`, `store_discountCode`, `store_phoneNo`, `store_snapchatAttributes`, `store_localStorageObject`, `store_sourceUrl`, `store_fbc`, `store_fbp`, `store_pincode`, `store_selectedAddress`, `store_giftCardTotal`, `store_twidPay`, `store_gstInfo`, `store_discountBasedRewards`, `store_selectedShippingMethod`, `store_orderType`, `store_requestId`, `store_merchanturl`, `store_moid`, `store_shopifySessionId`, `store_requestIdObject`, `store_foreignAnalytics`, `store_merchantInfo`, `store_webengageCustomerId`, `store_checkout_url`, `store_methodShopifyCustomerId`, `store_newUser`, `store_country_code`, `store_shopifyAddressFound`, `store_editPartialAddress`, `store_localStorageObject`, `store_order_name`, `store_riskFlag`, `store_merchantUserType`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_finalPayablePrice`, `store_totalPrice`, `store_gyftr`, `store_shopifyCookieInfo`, `store_sourceValue`, `store_fbExternalId`).
    *   Minor changes observed in the `ForeignAnalytics.ts` file mostly involve whitespace changes and re-saves, but a `console.log(res)` is added in the `store_totalPrice.subscribe` block at 17/11/2025, 13:44:52, then removed by 17/11/2025, 14:05:25, suggesting debugging.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Contlo.ts
*   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 13:05:00, 17/11/2025, 13:19:38, 17/11/2025, 13:45:19, 17/11/2025, 13:55:05, 17/11/2025, 14:07:01, 17/11/2025, 14:13:04, 17/11/2025, 14:13:49, 17/11/2025, 14:14:00
*   **Changes:** This file integrates with the Contlo analytics SDK.
    *   It provides a dummy `window.contlo` object with `init`, `identify`, `track`, and `push` methods for logging Contlo events, indicating a development or testing setup where the actual SDK might not always be present.
    *   The `createBody` function constructs a standardized payload for Contlo events, including common analytics data like `promo_code`, `cart_total_price`, `product_id`, user address details, shipping method, and UTM parameters.
    *   The `callContlo` function acts as a dispatcher, mapping internal event names (`mobileAddedGK`, `pinCode`, `paymentMethod`, `paymentCompleted`, `userAddress`, `coupon_applied_success_gk`, `coupon_applied_failed_gk`) to specific Contlo event functions (`contloMobile`, `contloPincode`, etc.).
    *   The `contloSendEvent` function wraps the actual `window.contlo.sendEvent` call in a `try-catch` block to gracefully handle cases where the Contlo SDK might not be loaded.
    *   Changes across timestamps show refinements to the `createBody` logic, particularly regarding the `cart_total_price`.
        *   **17/11, 13:05:00 & 17/11, 13:19:38:** `cart_total_price: commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount,`
        *   **17/11, 13:45:19:** `console.log(data)` added in `contloAddressAdded`, then removed in the next commit. This suggests debugging.
        *   **17/11, 14:07:01:** `cart_total_price: !isNaN(Number(commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount)) ? commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount : commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price,`
        *   **17/11, 14:13:04, 17/11, 14:13:49, 17/11, 14:14:00:** `const discountedAmount = Number(commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount); return { ..., cart_total_price: !!commonAnalyticsData?.cart_after_discount && !isNaN(discountedAmount) ? discountedAmount : commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price, ... }` This evolution shows increased robustness in handling `cart_total_price`, ensuring it's a valid number and falling back to `commonAnalyticsData?.cart_total_price` if `cart_after_discount` is invalid.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/Promotion.svelte
*   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 22:38:42
*   **Changes:** This Svelte component displays promotional text related to loyalty points, store credits, and gift cards.
    *   It imports `store_requestIdObject`, `store_page` from `CommonStore` and `LoginStore` respectively.
    *   It also imports `store_enableGiftCard`, `store_gyftr`, `store_useStoreCredit` from `OrderStore`.
    *   It uses reactive Svelte syntax (`$:`) to dynamically calculate `loyaltyEnabled`, `creditsEnabled`, and `gyftrEnabled` flags based on the state of the imported stores.
    *   The `redeemableText` is constructed dynamically to inform the user about available redemption options (Loyalty Points, Store Credits, Gift Card, Gyftr).
    *   `loyaltyDiscountText` changes based on the `currentPage` (e.g., "Login to Redeem...", "Enter OTP to Redeem...").
    *   `onMount` subscribes to `store_requestIdObject` to update `creditsDisplayName` and `loyaltyDisplayName` based on custom configurations.
    *   The component conditionally renders the promotional text if any of the redemption options are enabled and the page is less than 3.
    *   No multiple changes were provided for this file.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte
*   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 23:52:04, 17/11/2025, 23:53:11, 17/11/2025, 23:53:19, 18/11/2025, 00:00:01, 18/11/2025, 00:02:54, 18/11/2025, 00:03:11, 18/11/2025, 00:03:40, 18/11/2025, 00:05:32, 18/11/2025, 00:08:46, 18/11/2025, 12:19:54, 18/11/2025, 12:21:27, 18/11/2025, 12:23:13, 18/11/2025, 12:41:34, 18/11/2025, 12:42:12, 18/11/2025, 12:43:07, 18/11/2025, 12:45:43
*   **Changes:** This Svelte component manages the application and display of discounts and offers during checkout.
    *   It imports numerous Svelte stores from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore` to manage discount codes, offers, cart data, payment options, and user states.
    *   It defines a plethora of `let` variables for component state, including `couponField`, `discountInput`, `discountCouponApplied`, `recommendedCouponCode`, `phoneNumber`, `earnedLoyaltyDetails`, `discountDrawer`, `creditsApplied`, `storeCreditAvailable`, `cartAutoDiscount`, `applicableCredits`, various flags for discount features, and lists of available/applied coupons.
    *   A reactive block (`$:`) constructs the `allAppliedOffers` array, which includes automatic discounts, stacked discounts, manually applied coupons, and partner acquisition offers (like Cred). This array is then set to `store_allAppliedDiscounts`.
    *   The `onMount` hook sets up subscriptions to several stores, including `store_requestIdObject` (to configure discount-related features like `disable_discount_with_credits`, `dynamicAutomaticExtraDiscountList`), `store_reapplyEr`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, and `store_offers`.
    *   It includes logic for enabling/disabling discount application based on stacking rules and the number of discounts applied.
    *   The `processPartnerOffers` function handles logic for displaying Cred offers.
    *   Multiple timestamps show a recurring pattern: the file content is almost identical, with no substantive code changes. This suggests frequent re-saves, perhaps due to developer activity, or automated build processes.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte
*   **Timestamp:** 18/11/2025, 12:22:24, 18/11/2025, 12:23:52, 18/11/2025, 12:24:20, 18/11/2025, 12:24:44, 18/11/2025, 12:25:25, 18/11/2025, 12:40:55
*   **Changes:** This Svelte component serves as the main application entry point, orchestrating the entire checkout flow.
    *   It imports a large number of Svelte stores from `LoginStore` and `CommonStore` to manage application-wide state, including user login, cart data, page navigation, merchant information, analytics data, and UI elements.
    *   It imports various child components for different parts of the checkout flow (Address, PaymentOptions, OtpInput, LoadingScreen, etc.).
    *   The `onMount` lifecycle hook is extensive, setting up global event listeners (like `window.onpopstate` for back button handling), dispatching gift auto-popup events, and handling the initial launch message from the parent iframe.
    *   It processes `gokwikEvent.data` from the `launch` message to initialize numerous stores related to source, local storage, environment, session IDs, merchant info, and more.
    *   It includes logic for token handling (retrieving from local storage or cookies, setting new tokens) and incognito mode detection.
    *   The `history.pushState` and `window.onpopstate` logic is implemented to manage browser history and confirm exit from the checkout flow, with conditional logic based on `cashToPrepaid`, `currentPage`, and popup states.
    *   It dynamically sets `kpEmail` (Kwikpass email) from `gokwikEvent.data`.
    *   A significant pattern across these timestamps is the addition of a duplicate `logEvent` call for `checkout_assets_loaded` (`logEvent({ name: 'checkout_assets_loaded', eventType: 'development', type: 'event', data: { user_network: navigator?.connection?.effectiveType ?? 'not_suppoted' }, });`). This appears in the second `logEvent` block in the `onMount` function. This duplicate log event is consistently present in all changes for this file. This could indicate a debugging effort or an accidental copy-paste that was then propagated.
    *   Overall, this file is central to the checkout experience, handling state, navigation, and initial data setup.

/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/kwik-checkout.html
*   **Timestamp:** 18/11/2025, 14:49:20, 18/11/2025, 14:50:49, 18/11/2025, 14:51:01, 18/11/2025, 14:57:07, 18/11/2025, 14:57:19, 18/11/2025, 14:58:02, 18/11/2025, 14:58:58
*   **Changes:** This HTML file acts as the wrapper for the Kwik checkout, responsible for loading the integration script and various analytics pixels.
    *   The `initKwikCheckout` function dynamically creates and appends `<script>` tags for `gokwikIntegration` and `analyticsJs`, with environment-specific URLs (`sandbox.pdp.gokwik.co` vs `pdp.gokwik.co`).
    *   It also dynamically creates scripts for various analytics platforms like Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics, MoEngage, and WebEngage based on `storeInfo` configurations.
    *   The `fetchCart` function makes an XMLHttpRequest to `v1/user/shopify-cart` to get cart details and updates `merchantInfo.appCart`.
    *   `initListeners` sets up a `window.onmessage` handler to listen for `checkoutHealth` and `shopifyRedirect` messages, dispatching a `gk-checkout-disable` event if a redirect to fallback is needed. It also listens for `hardwareBackPress` to simulate browser back navigation.
    *   The `DOMContentLoaded` listener parses `storeInfo` and `kp_email` from URL parameters, setting various cookies (`_shopify_s`, `gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`, `_shopify_sa_p`).
    *   A notable change across timestamps is in the handling of `kp_email` from URL parameters within the `DOMContentLoaded` listener.
        *   **18/11, 14:49:20:** `if (kpEmail) { kpEmail = atob(kpEmail); window.__KP_EMAIL__ = kpEmail; localStorage.setItem('kp_email', kpEmail); }`
        *   **18/11, 14:50:49 & 18/11, 14:51:01:** `if (kpEmail) { window.__KP_EMAIL___ = kpEmail; kpEmail = atob(kpEmail); localStorage.setItem('kp_email', kpEmail); }` (Added an underscore to `__KP_EMAIL__`, likely a typo, then fixed it in the next commit).
        *   **18/11, 14:57:07, 18/11, 14:57:19, 18/11, 14:58:02:** Same as 14:49:20.
        *   **18/11, 14:58:58:** `if (kpEmail) { try { kpEmail = atob(kpEmail); window.__KP_EMAIL__ = kpEmail; localStorage.setItem('kp_email', kpEmail); } catch (e) { window.__KP_EMAIL__ = kpEmail; } }` This version adds a `try-catch` block around the `atob(kpEmail)` call, indicating a robustness improvement to handle cases where `kpEmail` might not be a valid base64 string, thus preventing errors.
    *   The repeated timestamps often show no functional code changes, implying frequent saving or minor formatting adjustments, but the `kpEmail` handling logic does evolve for error handling.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Svelte Store Reliance:** All `.svelte` and `.ts` files heavily rely on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for state management, reactive data flow, and inter-component communication. This is a core architectural pattern across the codebase.
2.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file and configurations within `merchant.html` and `kwik-checkout.html` demonstrate a clear pattern of adapting behavior (API URLs, analytics keys, merchant IDs) based on the deployment environment (e.g., `local`, `dev`, `sandbox`, `production`). This indicates a robust multi-environment setup for development, testing, and production.
3.  **Extensive Analytics Integration:** The `Merchant.svelte` and `ForeignAnalytics.ts` files, along with the HTML files, show a comprehensive integration with numerous third-party analytics and marketing platforms (Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics, MoEngage, WebEngage, CleverTap, Klaviyo, Snapchat, Contlo, etc.). This suggests a strong focus on tracking user behavior and campaign performance.
4.  **Discount and Offer Management:** `ShippingDiscount.service.ts`, `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `OrderSummary.svelte`, and `Discounts.svelte` are deeply intertwined in managing various types of discounts, gift cards, loyalty points, and promotional offers. The logic for applying, re-applying, removing, and calculating their impact on the total price is complex and central to the checkout experience.
5.  **Robust Error Handling & Debugging:** The addition of `try-catch` blocks (e.g., `Merchant.svelte`, `Contlo.ts`, `kwik-checkout.html`) and `console.log` statements (some temporary, some persistent) points to an active development process that prioritizes stability and debugging.
6.  **Checkout Flow Orchestration:** `App.svelte` acts as the orchestrator for the entire checkout flow, handling navigation, global events, and data initialization, highlighting a modular component-based architecture.
7.  **Frequent Minor Updates:** Many files, especially the Svelte components and HTML files, show multiple timestamps with little to no discernible functional code changes. This could be attributed to:
    *   **Frequent saves:** Developers often save work frequently.
    *   **Automated formatting/linting:** Pre-commit hooks or automated formatters might trigger saves without semantic changes.
    *   **Minor whitespace/comment changes:** Not always visible in a raw diff, but can trigger a commit.
    *   **Debugging cycles:** Saving and reverting small changes during active debugging.
8.  **Token and Session Management:** There's a clear emphasis on managing user session tokens and cookies (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`, `_shopify_s`, `localStorage.getItem`, `setCookie`) for authentication and state persistence.

The provided code changes primarily focus on enhancements within a `checkout-dashboard-ui` project, covering brand customization, product/collection search, order details, and free gift rule management. There's also a significant update to the main configuration file for a microfrontend architecture.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx`** (Timestamp: 16/11/2025, 13:10:34)
    This file introduces comprehensive functionality for customizing the checkout UI's brand elements. Key updates include:
    *   **Logo Management:** Implemented logic for uploading, validating (type, size < 2MB), fetching presigned URLs, and uploading brand logos to AWS S3. The UI now displays the uploaded logo or a placeholder.
    *   **Theme Color Customization:** Added a color picker component for merchants to set the primary theme color for their checkout.
    *   **Form Integration:** Utilizes `Form.useWatch` to monitor changes in brand data, enabling a "Save Changes" button only when modifications occur.
    *   **API Integration:** Calls internal APIs to manage logo updates and `useMerchantConfigApi` for saving custom CSS rules.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`** (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:22:51)
    This component provides a versatile search and selection interface for products or collections, likely used in discount or free gift configurations. Key features include:
    *   **Search and Pagination:** Supports searching for products/collections with debounced input and infinite scrolling using `useIntersectionObserver`.
    *   **Dynamic Data Handling:** Parses API responses to handle different search types ('products', 'collections') and can collate product variants.
    *   **Quantity and Pricing:** Includes functionality for incrementing/decrementing item quantities and setting gift prices for selected products.
    *   **Conditional Filtering:** Filters products based on tags for "agent-led" scenarios.
    *   **Modal Integration:** Displays search results within a modal for selection, managing items to add and their quantities.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx`** (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:23:04)
    This file details the display of individual order information, with significant enhancements to data presentation and refund management:
    *   **Refunds Merging:** Implemented `mergeRepeatedRefunds` to consolidate multiple refund attempts into a single, clearer entry with an `attempts` count.
    *   **Refund Button State:** Calculates and sets the `refundBtnState` to accurately reflect if a refund button should be disabled, its status, and the maximum refundable amount, considering existing transactions and prior refunds.
    *   **Dynamic Currency Display:** Automatically sets the global currency symbol based on order data or merchant details.
    *   **Order Editing Restrictions:** Introduced logic to disable order editing and provide tooltip messages if certain rewards (Twid, Loyalty Points) or GWP (Gift With Purchase) discounts are applied.
    *   **Price Breakup & Failure Reasons:** Enhanced calculation and display of total discounts, tax, shipping, gift card/rewards, and identifies order failure reasons.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`** (Timestamp: 18/11/2025, 00:45:31)
    This EJS template is the entry point for a Single-SPA microfrontend application. The primary update focuses on:
    *   **Environment-Based Microfrontend Loading:** Dynamically loads different `@gokwik` microfrontend modules (e.g., `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/checkout`, `@gokwik/payment`) from environment-specific URLs (`localhost`, `dev-dashboard`, `qa-dashboard`, `sandbox-dashboard`). This ensures the correct versions of microfrontends are loaded based on the `deployedEnv` variable.
    *   **Third-Party Integrations:** Includes conditional scripts for performance and analytics tools like Microsoft Clarity and New Relic, specifically for the `production` environment.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Defined a CSP to enhance security for the application.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`** (Timestamps: 18/11/2025, 00:49:40, 18/11/2025, 00:50:14, 18/11/2025, 00:58:39)
    This file handles the configuration of free gift rules for merchants. The content is identical across the three timestamps, suggesting minor non-functional saves or reformatting. The significant functional updates include:
    *   **Free Gift Rule Management:** Implemented a system to create, edit, delete, and enable/disable free gift rules.
    *   **Detailed Rule Configuration:** Rules can be defined based on various criteria: name, sales channels (App, Web, Agent-led, with 'Agent led' conditionally disabled), purchase requirements (cart value, quantity with min/max values), applicability (all products, specific products, specific collections), free gift product selection, quantity, price, and application method (auto or customer selection with a limit).
    *   **UI for Rules:** Displays rules in a table with a switch for status, and a dropdown for edit/delete actions. A drawer component facilitates adding or editing rules.
    *   **Product/Collection Selection:** Leverages the `ProductSearch` component to allow merchants to select specific products or collections for rule applicability or as the free gift itself.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Gokwik UI Kit Adoption:** There's a strong pattern of using `gokwik-ui-kit` components across all UI-related files, indicating a consistent design system.
*   **Merchant Configuration Management:** The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is a recurring element for interacting with merchant-specific settings, used in both brand customization and free gift pages. This suggests a standardized approach to handling merchant configurations.
*   **Redux for State Management:** `useSelector` and `useAppDispatch` from Redux are prevalent for accessing global state (merchant details, user config) and dispatching actions.
*   **API Interaction:** `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` are consistently used for network requests, pointing to a centralized utility for API communication.
*   **Microfrontend Architecture:** The `index.ejs` clearly illustrates a microfrontend setup, loading various `@gokwik` modules, which implies that the dashboard is composed of independent applications.
*   **Development Workflow:** The repeated timestamps for `freeGift.tsx` without code changes might suggest frequent saves during local development or automated formatting/linting runs.
*   **Focus on Customization:** A dominant theme across the `settings` pages is providing merchants with extensive customization options for their checkout experience, from branding to discount and gift rules.

## 20:36:07

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp: 13/11/2025, 14:31:36, 15/11/2025, 11:32:20, 17/11/2025, 13:01:29, 17/11/2025, 22:33:43, 17/11/2025, 23:35:35**
    *   This is a static HTML page acting as a merchant integration example or test bed.
    *   It contains JavaScript for initializing the `gokwikSdk`, handling messages from an iframe (likely the GoKwik checkout), and setting/getting cookies for tracking (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`).
    *   The `window.merchantInfo` object, which defines the merchant's configuration (mid, environment, storeId, fbpixel), is consistently updated across multiple commits. The `mid` value is changed frequently, indicating testing across different merchant configurations or environments.
    *   The identical timestamps across this file also point to frequent saves during development/testing, with the primary functional change being the `mid` value in `window.merchantInfo`.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 13/11/2025, 20:56:52 through 13/11/2025, 21:25:07, and 15/11/2025, 12:01:15**
    *   This Svelte component manages the payment options screen within the checkout flow.
    *   It imports a very large number of Svelte stores (CommonStore, OrderStore, LoginStore) to manage payment-related state.
    *   It handles the display and logic for various payment methods, discounts, and rewards (TwidPay, Shopify Store Credit, COD, Gift Cards).
    *   Significant activity includes logging GTM events (`payment_step_landed`), analytics (`AddPaymentInfo`), processing saved cards, and subscribing to numerous store updates to react to changes in cart, discounts, and user state.
    *   The core logic appears to be stable, with minor, frequent updates within a short time frame on the 13th and one additional change on the 15th.
    *   The change on 15/11/2025 adds `store_isLoggedInUser` and `store_isCartUpdated` to CommonStore imports, and introduces `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney` components, indicating new features related to free gifts. It also removes `calculateLoadTime` and `debounce` imports.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 15/11/2025, 11:49:48 and 15/11/2025, 11:52:44**

    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 12:56:56, 17/11/2025, 13:43:21, 17/11/2025, 13:44:00, 17/11/2025, 13:44:52, 17/11/2025, 14:05:25**
    *   This file is a central hub for integrating with various "foreign" analytics platforms (Clevertap, Klaviyo, Moengage, WebEngage, FB, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, EdgeTag, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics, GoogleAds).
    *   It defines a `priceBreakup` object to aggregate financial details (subtotal, discounts, shipping, COD, gift cards, tax).
    *   It subscribes to numerous stores (LoginStore, OrderStore, CommonStore) to gather data for analytics events.
    *   The `configObject` dynamically enables or disables different analytics pixels based on merchant configuration.
    *   A function `adSourceMapping` processes UTM parameters from the source.
    *   There's also frequent logging of `totalValue` to the console.
    *   The repeated timestamps again suggest minor iterative changes, often around data consistency (`commonAnalyticsData['cart_after_discount'] = (+res)?.toFixed(2)` and logging total value).

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/Promotion.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 22:38:42**
    *   This component displays promotional text related to loyalty points, store credits, or gift cards.
    *   It dynamically constructs a `redeemableText` based on whether `creditsEnabled`, `$store_enableGiftCard`, `loyaltyEnabled`, or `gyftrEnabled` are active.
    *   The `loyaltyDiscountText` is set based on the current `store_page`.
    *   The code includes commented-out `JSON.stringify` lines which might have been for debugging purposes.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 23:52:04 through 18/11/2025, 12:45:43**
    *   This Svelte component handles the display and application of various discounts and offers.
    *   It manages multiple types of discounts: automatic, stacked, partner acquisition (Cred), gift cards, loyalty.
    *   It defines how applied offers are displayed in `allAppliedOffers`, including their removability and associated actions.
    *   Subscribes to `store_requestIdObject` for configuration of discount features (e.g., `disable_discount_with_credits`, `no_of_discounts_clubbed`, dynamic automatic discounts).
    *   The `allowDiscountApplication` logic is updated based on stacking limits and other conditions.
    *   Frequent, minor, almost identical changes across numerous timestamps on the 17th and 18th indicate a period of intense debugging or fine-tuning of the discount application and display logic.
    *   One notable change is the refactoring of how `appliedAutomaticDiscounts` and `stackedDiscountConfig` contribute to `allAppliedOffers`, specifically adding conditional mapping for `amountSaved`.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp: 18/11/2025, 12:22:24 through 18/11/2025, 12:40:55**
    *   This is the main application component, orchestrating the entire checkout process.
    *   It manages navigation between pages (`currentPage`), handles browser history popstate events, and sets up global listeners.
    *   It receives `launch` data from the merchant integration (via `window.addEventListener('message')`) to initialize various stores and configurations.
    *   It dynamically sets view properties (mobile/desktop), logs checkout asset loading, and handles incognito mode detection.
    *   There's logic for auto-opening free gift popups for logged-in users and managing exit confirmation popups.
    *   Like other Svelte components, it imports a vast number of stores for centralized state management.
    *   The multiple, closely spaced timestamps show frequent saves or minor adjustments during active development.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/kwik-checkout.html`**
    *   **Timestamp: 18/11/2025, 14:49:20 through 18/11/2025, 14:58:58**
    *   This HTML file seems to be a template or entry point for the Kwik checkout within an iframe or similar integration.
    *   It includes JavaScript for `initKwikCheckout` (loading integration and analytics scripts), `fetchCart` (fetching Shopify cart data), and `createScript`/`createFbPixel`/`createGoogleAnalytics`/`createMoEngage`/`createWebEngage` functions to dynamically inject external tracking scripts.
    *   The `initListeners` function handles messages from the checkout and hardware back button presses.
    *   Cookie handling for `_shopify_s`, `gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`, and UTM parameters is also present.
    *   A notable change on 18/11/2025, 14:57:07 and 18/11/2025, 14:58:58 adds a `try-catch` block around `kpEmail = atob(kpEmail)` in the `DOMContentLoaded` listener, suggesting an attempt to handle potential base64 decoding errors for the Kwikpass email. This indicates a focus on robustness and error handling for user data.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **Svelte Store Usage:** A dominant pattern across almost all `.svelte` and `.service.ts` files is the heavy reliance on Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_requestIdObject`, `store_discountCode`, `store_totalPrice`) for managing application state. Components and services subscribe to these stores to react to changes and update their internal logic.
2.  **Analytics Integration:** There's a pervasive theme of integrating with various analytics platforms (Facebook, Google Analytics, WebEngage, Moengage, Snapchat, Contlo, etc.). Many files include imports for analytics services and logic to `logEvent` or `fireGtmEvent` at different stages of the checkout process (e.g., page loads, button clicks, discount applications, payment steps).
3.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file clearly shows the application's design to adapt to different deployment environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production) by providing environment-specific URLs and tokens. This is crucial for development, testing, and production deployments.
4.  **Discount and Offer Management:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around the complex logic of applying, displaying, and managing various types of discounts, coupons, gift cards, loyalty rewards, and partner offers. This includes auto-application, stacking, removal, and visual feedback (confetti).
5.  **Checkout Flow Control:** The `App.svelte` and `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` files contain logic for controlling the user's flow through the checkout, including page navigation, handling exit popups, and ensuring correct payment and shipping methods are selected.
6.  **Error Handling and Robustness:** Explicit `try-catch` blocks and conditional checks for API responses or data parsing are present, indicating efforts to make the application more resilient to unexpected data or network issues.
7.  **Frequent Iterative Changes:** Many files show multiple commits on the same day within a short timeframe. This suggests active development, debugging, and minor refinements rather than large, sweeping changes in a single commit. This is particularly noticeable in the analytics and discount-related files.
8.  **Merchant-Specific Customization:** The `merchant.html` and `Merchant.svelte` files demonstrate how the GoKwik checkout is integrated into a merchant's website, allowing for merchant-specific configurations (`mid`, `environment`, `fbpixel`, `storeId`).
9.  **Debugging/Logging:** The presence of `console.log` statements, commented-out debugging lines (like `JSON.stringify`), and explicit logging events (`logEvent`) indicates an active debugging and monitoring strategy.
10. **Cookie and Local Storage Management:** Extensive use of cookies and local storage is observed for persisting user data, session IDs, UTM parameters, and tokens, highlighting a focus on user experience and tracking continuity across sessions.

## 21:04:29
The provided log details recent updates across several UI components and configuration files within the `checkout-dashboard-ui` and `dashboard-ui-configuration` repositories.

**File-Specific Updates:**

    This component, `ProductSearch`, provides a reusable interface for searching and selecting products or collections, likely for discount or free gift configurations. Notable features include:
    *   **Generic Search:** Supports searching for either 'products' or 'collections'.
    *   **Infinite Scrolling:** Employs `useIntersectionObserver` to implement pagination and load more results as the user scrolls.
    *   **Debounced Input:** Implements a debounce mechanism for the search input to reduce API calls.
    *   **Item Management:** Handles adding, removing, and incrementing quantities of selected items within a modal interface.
    *   **Conditional Logic:** Includes specific filtering for `isAgentLed` items and an `InputNumber` for `topUpGift` price adjustments.
    *   **Collection Quantity Validation:** Enforces a maximum quantity for collections if `collectionMinimumPurchangeQuantity` is enabled.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:23:04)**
    The `OrderDetails` page has received significant updates, focusing on displaying comprehensive order information and refund management:
    *   **Detailed Order Data:** Fetches and displays extensive order details, including price breakups (discounts, taxes, shipping, COD charges, gift cards, rewards, store credits).
    *   **Refund Management:** Implements `mergeRepeatedRefunds` to consolidate refund attempts and calculates the `refundableAmount`. The refund button's state (`disabled`, `refundStatus`) is dynamically managed based on transaction and refund history.
    *   **Currency Formatting:** Introduces a global `setCurrencySymbol` and `formatAmountWithCurrency` helper to ensure correct currency display.
    *   **Dynamic Editability:** Sets the "Edit Order" button's `disableEdit` state and `title` based on the presence of Twid rewards, GWP discounts, or loyalty points.
    *   **Customer Information:** Masks customer phone numbers and emails, providing a button to reveal them.
    *   **RTO Integration:** Displays RTO (Return To Origin) related actions and scores based on merchant configuration.
    *   **Breadcrumbs:** Updates navigation breadcrumbs for the order details page.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (Timestamp: 18/11/2025, 00:45:31)**
    This EJS template for the main dashboard HTML file outlines the application's micro-frontend architecture and environment setup:
    *   **Single-SPA Integration:** Configures the application as a Single-SPA root config, importing React, React-DOM, and Single-SPA from CDNs.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Defines a `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag for security.
    *   **Environment-Specific Import Maps:** Conditionally loads `systemjs-importmap` scripts based on the `isLocal` or `deployedEnv` variables (dev, qa, sandbox, production). These maps specify the URLs for various `@gokwik/*` micro-frontend bundles (e.g., `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/checkout`, `@gokwik/payment`, etc.).
    *   **Monitoring Scripts:** Includes Microsoft Clarity and New Relic browser monitoring scripts for the `production` environment.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` (Timestamps: 18/11/2025, 00:49:40, 18/11/2025, 00:50:14, 18/11/2025, 00:58:39)**

    *   **Rule Management:** Allows merchants to create, edit, and delete free gift rules. Rules are displayed in a `Table` with an `enabled` status `Switch` and action `Dropdown`.
    *   **Rule Configuration:** Rules encompass various parameters: name, sales channels (app, web, agent-led), purchase requirements (cart value or quantity), minimum/maximum values, applicability (all products, specific products/collections), the free gift product itself, quantity, price, and application method (auto or customer selection).
    *   **Product/Collection Selection:** Integrates the `ProductSearch` component for selecting specific products or collections relevant to a rule.
    *   **Form Validation:** Includes validation for required fields and logical constraints (e.g., maximum value cannot be less than minimum value).
    *   **Breadcrumbs:** Updates navigation breadcrumbs for the free gift settings page.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React-based UI Development:** All application-level code is written in React, making extensive use of functional components and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, custom hooks).
*   **Gokwik-UI-Kit:** Consistent use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components (Button, Form, Card, Table, Input, Dropdown, Tooltip, Switch, message) across different pages for a unified look and feel.
*   **Merchant Configuration:** A common pattern involves `useMerchantConfigApi` hook to fetch and save merchant-specific configurations, ensuring customization options are persistent.
*   **API Interaction:** Frequent use of `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` utilities for backend communication.
*   **Redux Integration:** Redux is used for global state management, particularly for user and merchant details.
*   **Micro-frontend Architecture:** The `index.ejs` file clearly indicates a Single-SPA micro-frontend setup, where different parts of the dashboard are separate applications (`@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/checkout`, etc.), loaded conditionally based on the deployment environment.
*   **Breadcrumb Navigation:** The `updateBreadcrumbs` utility is consistently used to maintain navigational context.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Both `.env` (skipped for summary) and `index.ejs` demonstrate the use of environment variables to configure API endpoints and micro-frontend URLs for different deployment stages (dev, qa, sandbox, production).
*   **Timestamp Proximity:** Multiple identical entries for `freeGift.tsx` within a short timeframe suggest minor non-functional changes or repeated saves during development, or automated commit/log generation.

## 21:36:20
The provided logs indicate recent development activity across several files related to a checkout or payment processing system, likely for an e-commerce platform named "GoKwik". The changes primarily focus on store management, analytics integration, and UI components for payment and discounts.

### File-Specific Updates:

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 12/11/2025, 21:20:24 and 15/11/2025, 12:00:15
    *   **Updates:** Both entries show significant imports from `CommonStore` and `OrderStore`, indicating a dependency on global state management for various aspects of shipping, discounts, and order information. The `callShippingDiscountApi` function handles discount application, removal, and related logic, including confetti animation for successful discounts. It also manages gift card reapplication/removal based on cart updates and redirects users in specific scenarios (e.g., if no shipping options are found). Loyalty discounts are logged. The `processShippingDiscountResponse` function processes API responses, updating shipping methods, options, and discount information. Error messages are managed, excluding those for UTM auto-application failures. There's logic for retrying shipping method selection if multiple options are available. The second entry for this file appears identical to the first, suggesting no functional change between these timestamps.

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`**

    *   **Updates:** This file defines various base URLs for different GoKwik services (health, address suggestion, API, experiments, TwidPay, KP API, CDN, analytics) based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local, etc.). The multiple timestamps show minor adjustments or re-evaluations of these URLs, particularly for the `api_url` function, where different local and QA API endpoints are commented in/out or changed for testing purposes. For example, `api_url` initially had a commented-out `http://localhost:3000` for `local` and then switched to `https://api.gokwik.co`, then `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`, and back to `https://api.gokwik.co`. The `XGokwikToken` function also logs the environment for debugging.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 13/11/2025, 14:31:36; 15/11/2025, 11:32:20; 17/11/2025, 13:01:29; 17/11/2025, 22:33:43

        *   Initializes numerous reactive variables using `store.subscribe`.
        *   Contains logic for applying recommended rewards, handling COD payment failures, and managing the visibility of UPI collection and limited payment methods.
        *   Includes event logging for GTM, analytics, and specific actions like `payment_step_landed`.
        *   The last entry (15/11/2025, 12:01:15) introduces imports for `store_isLoggedInUser`, `store_isCartUpdated` from `CommonStore` and new components `AutomaticGiftHeader` and `GiftJourney`, suggesting new features related to free gifts and user login status being integrated into the payment flow. The repeated entries for this file prior to the last timestamp suggest iterative saves without significant content changes visible in the provided diffs, or minor formatting. The core logic around `onMount` remains consistent.
        *   The change on 13/11/2025, 21:22:28 adds `store_availableOffersCheck` to the `OrderStore` imports.

5.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`**

    *   **Timestamp:** 17/11/2025, 23:52:04; 17/11/2025, 23:53:11; 17/11/2025, 23:53:19; 18/11/2025, 00:00:01; 18/11/2025, 00:02:54; 18/11/2025, 00:03:11; 18/11/2025, 00:03:40; 18/11/2025, 00:05:32; 18/11/2025, 00:08:46; 18/11/2025, 12:19:54; 18/11/2025, 12:21:27; 18/11/2025, 12:23:13; 18/11/2025, 12:41:34; 18/11/2025, 12:42:12; 18/11/2025, 12:43:07; 18/11/2025, 12:45:43
    *   **Updates:** This Svelte component manages discount-related UI and logic. It interacts with numerous stores for cart data, offers, loyalty, gift cards, and various discount flags.
        *   Initializes many reactive variables to control discount display, application, and removal.
        *   Handles logic for stacking discounts, automatic discounts, and partner offers (e.g., Cred).
        *   Manages the `allAppliedOffers` array, which combines automatic, stacked, and partner acquisition discounts for display.
        *   The numerous identical entries suggest frequent saves, but the core functionality appears to revolve around managing complex discount application rules, including interactions with loyalty programs, gift cards, and partner-specific offers, and determining when discounts can be applied or removed.

11. **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 18/11/2025, 12:22:24; 18/11/2025, 12:23:52; 18/11/2025, 12:24:20; 18/11/2025, 12:24:44; 18/11/2025, 12:25:25; 18/11/2025, 12:40:55
    *   **Updates:** This is the main Svelte application file, acting as a wrapper for various checkout components. It sets up global event listeners, handles initial data loading (`launch` message from parent), and manages navigation/popstate.
        *   Imports a vast array of common and order-specific stores.
        *   Initializes many variables for managing UI state, loading, errors, and user data.
        *   Includes logic for handling browser history, pop-up states, and triggering events.
        *   Receives `launch` data from a parent (likely `merchant.html`) to initialize the checkout flow.
        *   **Key change around 18/11/2025, 12:22:24:** Two `logEvent` calls are added back-to-back with identical data: `{ name: 'checkout_assets_loaded', eventType: 'development', type: 'event', data: { user_network: navigator?.connection?.effectiveType ?? 'not_suppoted' }, }`. This is likely a debugging artifact. Subsequent entries are identical, indicating frequent saves.

12. **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/pdp/gokwik.pdp/public/kwik-checkout.html`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 18/11/2025, 14:49:20; 18/11/2025, 14:50:49; 18/11/2025, 14:51:01; 18/11/2025, 14:57:07; 18/11/2025, 14:57:19; 18/11/2025, 14:58:02; 18/11/2025, 14:58:58
    *   **Updates:** This HTML file appears to be a separate checkout integration page, potentially for an embedded checkout experience. It's responsible for:
        *   Loading the main GoKwik integration script (`merchant.integration.js`) and analytics scripts (Facebook Pixel, Google Analytics, WebEngage, MoEngage).
        *   Fetching cart data from a Shopify cart endpoint.
        *   Initializing `gokwikSdk.initCheckout` once the integration script is loaded and cart data is available.
        *   **Key changes around 18/11/2025, 14:57:07 onwards:** The handling of `kpEmail` parameter from the URL is refined with a `try-catch` block, suggesting an improvement in robustness for parsing the base64-encoded email. Some commented-out lines like `alert('intergation loded '+JSON.stringify(cart ||{}));` are also present, indicating debugging phases.

### Timestamps of Significant Changes:

*   **12/11/2025, 21:20:24:** Initial log of `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` detailing discount and shipping logic.
*   **13/11/2025, 14:31:15:** First entry for `EnvironmentService.ts`, showing initial environment URL configurations.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **State Management (Svelte Stores):** A pervasive pattern is the extensive use of Svelte stores (e.g., `store_page`, `store_cartjsObject`, `store_requestIdObject`, `store_discountCode`) for managing global application state across multiple components. This indicates a highly reactive and component-driven architecture.
*   **Environment-Specific Configurations:** The `EnvironmentService.ts` file clearly shows different API and CDN URLs based on the deployment environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, local). This is crucial for managing various development, testing, and production instances.
*   **Analytics Integration:** Multiple files (`ForeignAnalytics.ts`, `Contlo.ts`, `Merchant.svelte`, `PaymentOptions.svelte`) demonstrate a strong emphasis on integrating various third-party analytics platforms (Facebook, Google Analytics, WebEngage, MoEngage, Snapchat, Contlo, CleverTap, Klaviyo, Netcore, CustomerLabs, Shopify Analytics, Google Ads). Events are logged for user actions, checkout steps, and discount applications. This suggests a data-driven approach to understanding user behavior and optimizing the checkout flow.
*   **Discount and Offer Logic:** The `ShippingDiscount.service.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` files highlight complex logic around discount application, stacking, removal, and interaction with loyalty programs, gift cards, and partner offers. This is a core feature of the GoKwik platform.
*   **Checkout Flow and UI Components:** `App.svelte`, `PaymentOptions.svelte`, and `OrderSummary.svelte` illustrate the modular breakdown of the checkout UI into distinct Svelte components, handling different parts of the user journey (address, payment, order summary, login/OTP).
*   **Debugging and Iteration:** The presence of numerous identical entries for several files (e.g., `PaymentOptions.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`, `Merchant.svelte`, `ForeignAnalytics.ts`) and specific debugging statements (`console.log`, `JSON.stringify`, `alert`) suggests an active development phase with frequent saves and debugging cycles.
*   **Cookie and Local Storage Usage:** There's consistent use of cookies (`_shopify_s`, `gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, `_scid`, `gk_utm_source`, `_shopify_sa_p`, `SP_DUID`, `localization`, `kp_user_id`, `KWIKUSERTOKEN`, `kpmclid`) and local storage (`kp-login-no`, `cash_to_prepaid`, `gk_login_source`, `goKwikToken`, `kp_email`) for managing user sessions, tracking data, and checkout state.
*   **URL Parameter Processing:** URL parameters (`mrid`, `gkref`, `so_token`, `gk_token`, `kp_email`, `utmParams`) are frequently used to pass information and configure the checkout experience, especially for specific flows like abandon cart or embedded checkouts.
*   **Truecaller Integration:** The `Merchant.svelte` file shows configuration for Truecaller integration across different environments, implying mobile user verification.
*   **`_webengage_script_tag` with `webengage.init()`:** This pattern is observed in both `merchant.html` and `kwik-checkout.html`, indicating a consistent way of initializing WebEngage analytics with a specific ID.
*   **`gk-checkout-disable` event:** Both `merchant.html` and `kwik-checkout.html` listen for this custom event, suggesting a standardized mechanism to handle checkout failures or redirects to a fallback.

The code changes primarily focus on enhancing UI customization, product/collection search functionality, and order details management within a dashboard application. A significant pattern observed across these changes is the consistent use of `@gokwik` utilities for API interactions and Redux for state management, along with extensive utilization of Ant Design-like components from `gokwik-ui-kit` for building interactive forms and tables. The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is a recurring element for handling merchant-specific configurations.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx` (Timestamp: 16/11/2025, 13:10:34)**
    This file introduces a comprehensive brand customization page. Key changes include:

    *   **Theme Color Customization:** Integration of a `ColorPicker` component to allow merchants to define a primary theme color for their checkout UI.
    *   **State Management & API Integration:** Uses `isVisible` to manage button states, `useEffect` hooks for fetching existing logo/config, and dispatches `updateBrandData` on form value changes. `onFinish` handles API calls to update logo and save custom configurations.
    *   **User Guidance:** Adds an `InfoComponent` with a link to documentation for brand settings.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:22:51)**
    This component receives a substantial upgrade, making it more versatile for searching and selecting products or collections:
    *   **Enhanced Configurability:** Introduces numerous new props like `hideSearch`, `collateProducts`, `showQuantity`, `isAgentLed`, `topUpGift`, and `collectionSpecificData` to control its behavior and appearance.
    *   **Improved Search Logic:** The `parseResponse` and `fetchData` functions are updated to handle both products and collections, including filtering items by agent-specific tags and consolidating product variants when `collateProducts` is enabled.
    *   **Quantity Management:** New functions (`handleQuantityChange`, `handleGiftPrice`) are added to allow dynamic updates of quantities and gift prices for selected items.
    *   **Infinite Scrolling:** Implements `useIntersectionObserver` for loading more results as the user scrolls, improving user experience for large datasets.
    *   **Dynamic UI Elements:** Adds UI controls like `InputNumber` for quantity/price adjustments, and `EditOutlined`/`CloseOutlined` for item manipulation within the search results.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:23:04)**
    This file sees significant enhancements to the order details page, focusing on financial breakdowns and order management:
    *   **Comprehensive Price Breakdowns:** Expands the calculation and display of `total_discount`, `tax`, `shipping_and_cod_charges`, and `gift_card_and_rewards` from the order's `price_breakup` data.
    *   **Refund Management:** Implements `mergeRepeatedRefunds` to consolidate multiple refund attempts and calculates `refundableAmount` and `refundBtnState` based on transaction statuses, enabling a detailed refund drawer.
    *   **Dynamic Currency Handling:** Introduces `formatCurrency` and `formatAmountWithCurrency` helpers to ensure correct display of monetary values with the appropriate currency symbol, retrieved from order data or merchant details.
    *   **Customer Information:** Masked customer phone and email are displayed with an option to reveal them, enhancing privacy and control.
    *   **Order Status & Actions:** Displays order status using color-coded tags, identifies `order_failure_reason`, and conditionally displays 'Edit Order' button with tooltips explaining disable reasons (e.g., loyalty points, GWP discounts).
    *   **Microfrontend Integration:** Incorporates `navigateToUrl` from `single-spa`, suggesting integration with other parts of the dashboard.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (Timestamp: 18/11/2025, 00:45:31)**
    This file, an EJS template, defines the base HTML structure and environment-specific configurations for the dashboard:
    *   **Content Security Policy:** Sets a robust `Content-Security-Policy` with directives for `default-src`, `script-src`, `connect-src`, `style-src`, `object-src`, and `img-src`, allowing specific sources and `unsafe-inline`/`unsafe-eval` for scripts.
    *   **Microfrontend Loading:** Uses `systemjs-importmap` to define URLs for various `@gokwik` microfrontends (`configuration`, `utilities`, `dashboard`, `checkout`, `payment`, `kwikpass`, `rto`, `kwikship`, `ellora`, `checkout-platform`, `shopify-app`, `kwikcomm`). These URLs are dynamically chosen based on the `deployedEnv` variable (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).
    *   **Analytics & Monitoring:** In the production environment, scripts for `clarity.ms` (for user behavior analytics) and `New Relic` (for application performance monitoring) are included, with specific keys and IDs.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` (Timestamps: 18/11/2025, 00:49:40, 18/11/2025, 00:50:14, 18/11/2025, 00:58:39)**
    All three entries for this file show identical code content, indicating no functional changes between these timestamps. The file focuses on free gift rule management:
    *   **Free Gift Rule Creation:** Implements a form (`Form.useForm`) to create and manage free gift rules with various configurable options.
    *   **Rule Parameters:** Allows setting a rule `name`, applicable `sales_channels` (app, web, agent-led), `purchase_type` (cart value, quantity), `min_value` and `max_value`, `applicable_on` (all products, specific products, specific collections), `free_product` selection, `free_gift_quantity`, `free_gift_price`, and `application_method` (auto or selection with a `selection_limit`).
    *   **Dynamic Form Fields:** Uses a `fields` array with a `RenderField` component, indicating a pattern for dynamically rendering form elements based on a configuration.
    *   **Rule Management Table:** Displays existing free gift rules in a `Table` with columns for name, free gift product (with image), status (`Switch` for enabling/disabling), and actions (`Dropdown` for edit/delete).
    *   **Integration with Product Search:** Utilizes the `ProductSearch` component for selecting free gift products and for defining specific products/collections where the gift is applicable.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Timestamps:** A clear progression of work across different modules, from UI customization (16/11) to product search and order details (17/11), and then broader configuration and free gift settings (18/11). The identical timestamps for `freeGift.tsx` on 18/11 might indicate minor non-code changes or repeated saves.
*   **Component-Driven Development:** Strong emphasis on reusable React components (e.g., `ProductSearch`, `ColorPicketComponent`, `InfoComponent`, `RenderField`) for building UI features.
*   **Configuration-as-Code:** The `index.ejs` file demonstrates how deployment environment affects external asset loading, and `FreeGift.tsx` uses a `fields` array to define form structure, highlighting a configuration-driven approach.
*   **User Experience Focus:** Consistent inclusion of UI elements like `Tooltip`, `message` for feedback, breadcrumbs (`updateBreadcrumbs`), and dynamic input masking/revealing to enhance user interaction and information delivery.
*   **Security and Performance:** The `index.ejs` file explicitly sets a `Content-Security-Policy` and integrates performance monitoring tools (New Relic, Clarity) for production deployments, indicating attention to security and site health.
*   **Microfrontend Architecture:** The `index.ejs` clearly outlines a microfrontend setup with `single-spa` and `systemjs-importmap`, allowing different parts of the dashboard to be developed and deployed independently.

The provided log primarily details changes to a single file: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile:** This Dockerfile is used to containerize a Node.js application.
    *   It uses `node:20-alpine` as the base image.
    *   Sets the working directory to `/app`.
    *   Installs `openssl` via `apk`.
    *   Copies `package*.json` files.
    *   Generates the Prisma schema using `npx prisma generate`.
    *   Builds the application with `npm run build`.
    *   Exposes port `3000`.
    *   Starts the application with `npm start`.

**Timestamps of significant changes:**

*   **28/10/2025 (multiple entries around 12:27-12:29):** The Dockerfile consistently used the command `RUN npm install -f` for dependency installation.
*   **29/10/2025, 23:35:21:** A notable change occurred where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This indicates a removal of the `--force` flag during package installation.

**Patterns or recurring elements:**

*   The overall structure and sequence of commands in the Dockerfile remained constant throughout all log entries, indicating a stable deployment configuration for the application.
*   The only repeated modification across the log entries was the specific `npm install` command, with the `--force` flag being present in earlier versions and removed in the latest logged version.

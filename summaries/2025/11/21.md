# Activity Summary for 21/11/2025

## 12:05:28
### File-Specific Summaries:

**1. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx` (16/11/2025, 13:10:34)**
This file defines the `BrandPage` component, which allows merchants to customize their checkout UI's branding. Key functionalities include:
- **Logo Upload:** Merchants can upload their brand logo. The component handles image validation (type, size), cleaning with canvas, generating a unique path, getting a pre-signed S3 URL, and uploading the image to AWS S3. It then updates the form with the logo URL and dispatches an action to update logo data in the Redux store.
- **Primary Color Selection:** A `ColorPicketComponent` is used for selecting the primary theme color for the checkout UI, which is then saved as part of the merchant's custom configuration.
- **Form Management:** Uses Ant Design's `Form` for managing brand data, including logo and primary color. Changes to form values trigger a state update (`isVisible`) to enable/disable the "Save Changes" button.
- **API Integration:** Interacts with `APIEndPoints` for downloading existing logos, getting pre-signed URLs for uploads, and updating merchant configurations.
- **State Management:** Utilizes Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) to fetch merchant details and dispatch updates.

**2. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` (17/11/2025, 16:22:51 & 21/11/2025, 11:48:56)**
This `ProductSearch` component facilitates searching and selecting products or collections, primarily used for discount and free gift configurations.
- **Core Functionality:** Allows searching for Shopify products or collections, displaying results in a modal, and adding/removing selected items. It supports features like infinite scrolling (`useIntersectionObserver`), debounced search, and handling product variants.
- **Dynamic Search Types:** Can search for either 'products' or 'collections' based on `searchType` prop.
- **Product Aggregation:** When `collateProducts` is true, it groups product variants under their parent product for display and selection.
- **Quantity Management:** Supports displaying and modifying quantities for selected items, with specific logic for collection quantities and minimum purchase requirements.
- **Agent-Led Filtering:** Includes logic to filter products based on `no-agent` tags when `isAgentLed` is true.
- **Top-Up Gift Price:** Introduces a `topUpGift` prop to allow setting an `offered_price` for freebie products.
- **Recent Update (21/11/2025, 11:48:56):** Added a `DeleteOutlined` icon for removing items from the search result in the modal (though the provided code snippet for this specific update doesn't fully show its context within the modal's item rendering). A `btnSearch` prop was added to allow a button to trigger the search modal directly. The logic for displaying selected variants (`product?.variants?.length && ...`) was also slightly refined.

**3. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` (17/11/2025, 16:23:04)**
This file defines the `OrderDetails` page for viewing and managing individual orders.
- **Order Data Display:** Fetches and displays comprehensive order information, including line items, payment details, refunds, and price breakdowns (discounts, taxes, shipping, gift cards, rewards).
- **Refund Management:** Implements logic for merging repeated refund attempts and calculating refundable amounts. It also controls the state and display of a "Refund" button and a `RefundDrawer`.
- **Currency Formatting:** Includes custom `formatCurrency` and `formatAmountWithCurrency` helpers to ensure amounts are displayed with the correct currency symbol, dynamically retrieved from order data or merchant details.
- **Conditional Actions:** Dynamically enables/disables order editing based on applied rewards, GWP discounts, or loyalty points. RTO actions are conditionally displayed based on merchant configuration.
- **Breadcrumbs & Navigation:** Manages breadcrumbs for the page and handles navigation for order not found scenarios.
- **Sensitive Data Masking:** Masks customer phone numbers and emails (`billing_phone_mask`, `billing_email_mask`).

**4. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (18/11/2025, 00:45:31 & 20/11/2025, 18:37:48)**
This is the main EJS template file for the Single-SPA dashboard application.
- **Microfrontend Configuration:** Defines SystemJS import maps to load various Gokwik microfrontends (e.g., `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/checkout`, `@gokwik/payment`) based on the `deployedEnv` (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).
- **Dependency Management:** Includes CDN links for `react`, `react-dom`, and `single-spa`.
- **Security Policies:** Sets a `Content-Security-Policy` for the application, allowing resources from self, HTTPS, and localhost.
- **New Relic Integration:** Includes a New Relic browser agent script for performance monitoring, with environment-specific configuration details (accountID, agentID, licenseKey).
- **Clarity Integration:** Conditionally includes a Microsoft Clarity tracking script based on `clarityKey` for production environments.
- **Timestamp 20/11/2025, 18:37:48:** The primary change is the update of `@gokwik/utilities`, `@gokwik/dashboard`, `@gokwik/payment`, `@gokwik/kwikpass`, `@gokwik/rto`, `@gokwik/kwikship`, `@gokwik/ellora`, `@gokwik/checkout-platform`, and `@gokwik/shopify-app` URLs in the `isLocal` environment to point to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/` instead of `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/` or `//localhost:XXXX`. This indicates a shift in the local development environment's dependency resolution to QA-deployed versions of other microfrontends.

**5. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` (18/11/2025, 00:49:40, 18/11/2025, 00:50:14, & 18/11/2025, 00:58:39)**
This `FreeGift` component allows merchants to configure free gift rules.
- **Rule Management:** Provides a form to create and edit free gift rules, including name, sales channels, purchase type (cart value/quantity), min/max value, applicability (all products, specific products, specific collections), free gift product selection, quantity, price, and application method (auto/selection).
- **Product/Collection Search Integration:** Uses `ProductSearch` component for selecting specific products or collections that trigger the free gift or are offered as free gifts.
- **Dynamic Form Fields:** Fields are conditionally rendered or disabled based on other form values (e.g., `selection_limit` visibility based on `application_method`).
- **Table Display:** Rules are listed in a table, allowing enabling/disabling via a `Switch`, and editing/deleting via a `Dropdown` menu.
- **State Management:** Manages state for `newRules` (drawer visibility), `newGift` (list of gift rules), `editRuleId`, and `isChanged` (to enable/disable Save button).
- **Breadcrumbs:** Updates breadcrumbs to reflect the current page.
- **No significant code changes between the three timestamps for this file; likely just minor formatting or save operations.**

**6. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/orderConfirmationPage/collapseFields.tsx` (18/11/2025, 23:42:52)**
This component, `CustomizeUiFields`, is responsible for rendering collapsible customization sections for the order confirmation page.
- **Collapsible Sections:** Organizes various UI customization options into `Collapse` panels: Brand Logo, Dynamic Banners, Trust Banner, Order Details, Customer Information, and Support & Communication.
- **Dynamic Field Rendering:** Uses a `RenderField` utility and custom render functions (`RenderEditorFunction`, `ColorPickerHelper`) to display different types of form inputs (switch, text input, color picker).
- **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Implements drag-and-drop functionality for reordering the collapsible sections, allowing merchants to customize the layout of the order confirmation page.
- **Conditional Visibility:** Many fields are conditionally hidden based on the `enabled` state of their parent section.
- **Prop-Based Form Interaction:** Receives `form` and `setButtonState` props to interact with the parent form and trigger save button state changes.

**7. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/orderConfirmation/index.tsx` (19/11/2025, 21:10:01, 19/11/2025, 21:11:54, 19/11/2025, 21:12:22, & 19/11/2025, 21:12:29)**
This `OrderConfirmationPage` component provides the interface for merchants to customize their post-purchase experience.
- **Main Layout:** Uses a two-column layout (`Row`, `Col`) with customization forms on the left and a live preview on the right.
- **Form Management:** Utilizes Ant Design's `Form` with `initialValuesForThankYouPageForm` and `onValuesChange` to track changes and enable the "Save Changes" button.
- **Customizable Sections:** Integrates `MainSection` (which likely includes `CustomizeUiFields`) to manage various customizable elements of the confirmation page.
- **Form Submission Logic:** `handleFormSubmit` validates form fields, specifically excluding certain fields from validation if they are dynamically controlled, and logs the form data.
- **Informational Alerts:** Includes an `Alert` component to inform users about redirecting from Shopify's page.
- **InfoComponent:** Provides a link to a wiki page for more information on customizing the UI.
- **Timestamp 19/11/2025, 21:11:54, 19/11/2025, 21:12:22, & 19/19/2025, 21:12:29:** The `flex` property of the `Col` components was adjusted (from `1 1 200px` to `1 1 300px` and back to `1 1 200px`, then to `1 1 300px` again, while the right column's `flex` also fluctuated between `0 1 500px` and `0 1 300px`). These changes indicate minor adjustments to the responsive layout or column widths for the customization and preview sections.

**8. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` (20/11/2025, 18:44:34, 20/11/2025, 18:44:55, 20/11/2025, 18:49:44, & 20/11/2025, 18:49:50)**
This `processProductBasedShippingData` component is a helper/renderer for configuring product-based shipping rules.
- **Rule Definition:** Allows defining shipping rules based on specific products or collections, including rule name, price, mapping to an existing shipping ID, calculation method (override/add-on), price multiplier, and combination with weight-based shipping.
- **Product/Collection Selection:** Integrates `ProductSearch` to add products or collections to the shipping rule. It includes validation to prevent adding similar product variants or collections multiple times.
- **Data Mapping:** `dataMapperForItems` transforms selected products/collections into a format suitable for display in the table.
- **Dynamic Options:** `selectedOptions` memoizes a list of available shipping IDs for mapping, filtering out already used ones.
- **Form Structure:** Defines a `fields` array for dynamically rendering form items using `RenderField`.
- **Table Display:** Displays selected items (products/collections) in a table, allowing removal.
- **Keypress Validation (20/11/2025, 18:49:44 & 20/11/2025, 18:49:50):** A `onKeyPress` validator was added to the 'Rule price' `inputNumber` field to restrict input to only numbers and decimal points (`/[0-9.]$/.test(event.key)`). This prevents invalid characters in the price field. The change between `18:49:44` and `18:49:50` seems to be an exact duplicate, indicating a re-save or minor, non-functional change.

**9. `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` (21/11/2025, 11:50:18 & 21/11/2025, 11:51:40)**
This file provides a collection of utility helper functions.
- **Filtering & Formatting:** `getDynamicSearchFilters`, `formatDateString`, `setCurrencySymbol`, `formatAmount` for data manipulation and display. `formatAmount` handles number formatting with a global currency symbol and optional notation.
- **Comparison & Validation:** `shopifyAppCheckoutEnabledStatus` (checks last login date), `deepCompare` (for object comparison), `uploadCohortCsv` (validates and processes CSV files for phone numbers or emails).
- **Date & Time Helpers:** `debounce`, `disabledBeforeDate`, `disabledBeforeTime`, `getFutureDateString`, `disabledDate`, `disabledTime` for handling dates and times, often used in date pickers.
- **String Manipulation:** `capitalizeFirstLetter`.
- **Table Data Processing:** `extractTitlesAndDataIndexes` (for table columns), `sortDataByKey`, `extractUniqueCKeysForAntColumn`.
- **Array Comparison:** `compareAndCaptureArrayFields` for identifying added/removed items in arrays.
- **Range Validation:** `areBothRangesMoreThanOneDay`.
- **No significant code changes between the two timestamps for this file; likely just minor formatting or save operations.**

### Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:

1.  **React and Ant Design:** The codebase heavily relies on React for UI development and `gokwik-ui-kit` (which seems to be an Ant Design wrapper/extension) for components like `Form`, `Button`, `Card`, `Table`, `Input`, `Switch`, `Dropdown`, `message`, `Tooltip`, `Alert`, `Col`, `Row`, `Collapse`, etc.
2.  **Modular Architecture:** Components are organized by functionality (e.g., `BrandPage`, `ProductSearch`, `OrderDetails`, `FreeGift`, `OrderConfirmationPage`) and reusable utilities (`helper.ts`, `shippingBasedData.tsx`).
3.  **Form Management:** Consistent use of `Form.useForm()` and `Form.useWatch()` for managing form state, validations, and reacting to value changes. `RenderField` is a common utility for rendering various form input types.
4.  **API Interaction:** Frequent use of `makeAPICall` (and `makeAWSPutCall`) with `APIEndPoints` for fetching and updating data, suggesting a centralized API utility.
5.  **State Management (Redux):** `useAppDispatch` and `useSelector` indicate the use of Redux (or a similar state management library) for global state management (e.g., `getMerchantDetails`, `updatedLogoData`).
6.  **Customization Focus:** Many components, especially `BrandPage` and `OrderConfirmationPage`, are geared towards allowing merchants to customize various aspects of the checkout and post-purchase UI. This often involves color pickers, image uploads, and conditional display of UI elements.
7.  **Data Fetching & Loading States:** Common use of `useState` for `loading` flags and `useEffect` for data fetching, indicating asynchronous operations.
8.  **User Experience Features:** Includes features like debounced search, infinite scrolling, client-side validation, and informative error/success messages (`message.error`, `message.success`).
9.  **Date and Time Handling:** `dayjs` library is consistently used for date and time manipulations, including formatting, comparisons, and disabling dates in pickers.
10. **Microfrontend Integration:** The `index.ejs` file shows a clear pattern of configuring and loading multiple microfrontends using SystemJS import maps, with distinct configurations for different deployment environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production). This is crucial for a large, modular application.
11. **Environment Configuration:** The `.env` files (though excluded from detailed summary for security reasons) are used to manage environment-specific API URLs, indicating a standard practice for managing configurations across different deployments.
12. **Layout and Responsiveness:** Frequent use of `Row`, `Col`, and `flex` properties for layout, suggesting attention to responsive design.

    *   **Functionality:** A component for customizing various sections of the order confirmation page using a collapsable interface.
    *   **Key Updates:** Introduces draggable `Collapse` items for Brand Logo, Dynamic Banners, Trust Banner, Order Details, Customer Information, and Support & Communication sections.
    *   Each section has a switch to enable/disable it, and some offer color pickers and input fields for customization (e.g., confirmation message, heading text, button text/link).
    *   Utilizes `LogoPage`, `RenderEditorFunction`, and `TrustBadgeForm` components for specific customization areas.

6.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/orderConfirmation/index.tsx`** (Timestamp: 19/11/2025, 21:10:01, 19/11/2025, 21:11:54, 19/11/2025, 21:12:22, 19/11/2025, 21:12:29)
    *   **Functionality:** The main page for configuring the custom order confirmation page, including a live preview.
    *   **Key Updates:** These multiple timestamps show minor adjustments to the `flex` properties of `Col` components (`flex='1 1 200px'`, `flex='0 1 500px'` changed to `flex='1 1 300px'`, `flex='0 1 300px'`, then back to `flex='1 1 200px'`, `flex='0 1 500px'`, and again to `flex='1 1 300px'`, `flex='0 1 500px'`). These changes likely adjust the width distribution between the settings form and the preview panel, indicating iterative layout refinements.
    *   **Content:** Provides an `Alert` message about redirecting to a custom page. It uses `MainSection` (which contains `CustomizeUiFields`) for the main form and `OrderConfirmationPreview` for displaying the changes. Includes `InfoComponent` for guidance and a "Save Changes" button, enabled when the form values change. `handleFormSubmit` validates fields and logs `formFields`.

7.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`** (Timestamp: 20/11/2025, 18:44:34, 20/11/2025, 18:44:55, 20/11/2025, 18:49:44, 20/11/2025, 18:49:50)
    *   **Functionality:** Manages product-based shipping rules.
    *   **Key Updates:**
        *   **20/11/2025, 18:44:34 & 20/11/2025, 18:44:55:** The `Rule price` field's `type` attribute was changed from `inputNumber` to `input`, suggesting a change in how price input is handled, possibly to allow non-numeric or more flexible input, though the `type='number'` in `inputProps` and the validation rules remain.
        *   **20/11/2025, 18:49:44 & 20/11/2025, 18:49:50:** A `onKeyPress` handler was added to the `Rule price` input field to restrict input to only numbers and periods (`.`), ensuring numeric values while using `type='input'`.
    *   **Content:** Uses `ProductSearch` to add products or collections to a shipping rule. It displays selected items in a table. Rules include name, price, mapped shipping ID, calculation method (override/add-on), price multiplier, and combination with weight-based shipping.

8.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts`** (Timestamp: 21/11/2025, 11:50:18 and 21/11/2025, 11:51:40)
    *   **Functionality:** A utility file containing helper functions for various common tasks.
    *   **Key Updates:** No functional changes were observed between these two timestamps, implying minor non-semantic edits or just file saves.
    *   **Content:** Contains functions for dynamic search filters, date formatting, currency formatting (`formatAmount`, `setCurrencySymbol`), Shopify app checkout status, deep object comparison, debouncing, date/time disabling for pickers, string capitalization, number formatting, extracting table column titles/data indexes, sorting data, CSV upload for cohorts (phone/email validation), getting future dates, comparing array fields, and checking date ranges.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Ant Design (gokwik-ui-kit):** Extensive use of Ant Design components like `Form`, `Button`, `Card`, `Col`, `Row`, `Upload`, `Switch`, `Table`, `Input`, `InputNumber`, `Radio`, `Dropdown`, `Tooltip`, `Alert`, `Collapse` throughout the dashboard UI files. This indicates a consistent UI framework.
*   **Form Management:** The `Form.useForm()` hook and `Form.useWatch()` are frequently used for local state management and reactive form updates. `onFinish` handlers are consistently used for form submission logic.
*   **API Interactions:** `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall` (for AWS S3) are standard utilities for interacting with backend services. `APIEndPoints` are used for API URL consistency.
*   **Merchant Configuration:** `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is a recurring element for fetching and saving merchant-specific configurations, demonstrating a centralized approach to settings management.
*   **Redux for State Management:** `useAppDispatch` and `useSelector` indicate the use of Redux for global state, particularly for user details (`getMerchantDetails`, `updatedLogoData`).
*   **Utility Helpers:** Frequent imports from `@library/utilities/helpers/helper` and `@gokwik/utilities` for common tasks like breadcrumbs, image processing, date formatting, and data manipulation.
*   **Component Reusability:** `ProductSearch` and `RenderField` are examples of reusable components integrated across different settings pages (discounts, shipping, free gifts). `ColorPickerHelper` is another example.
*   **UI Customization Focus:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around giving merchants granular control over their checkout UI, including branding, order confirmation details, and various banners.
*   **Layout Structure:** `Row` and `Col` from Ant Design are consistently used for creating responsive layouts, often with `flex` properties for dynamic sizing, especially noticeable in the `orderConfirmation` page for splitting content and preview.
*   **Error Handling:** `message.error` is used for displaying user-friendly error messages, primarily after API calls or validation failures.
*   **Timestamp Pattern:** Most changes occurred between 16/11/2025 and 21/11/2025, indicating active development within this timeframe. There are multiple, closely timed updates to the same files (e.g., `freeGift.tsx`, `orderConfirmation/index.tsx`, `shippingBasedData.tsx`), suggesting rapid iterations or minor adjustments/saves during development.

    *   Introduces draggable functionality for `Collapse` items, allowing users to reorder the sections.
    *   Utilizes `ColorPickerHelper` and `RenderEditorFunction` for UI element styling and content editing.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/orderConfirmation/index.tsx` (19/11/2025, 21:10:01, 21:11:54, 21:12:22, 21:12:29):**
    *   Manages the overall "Order Confirmation Page" settings.
    *   **19/11/2025, 21:10:01:**
        *   Provides a toggle to enable/disable the custom order confirmation page.
        *   Includes an `Alert` message advising to reapply Shopify customizations.
        *   Layout with two columns: one for form settings and one for a preview.
        *   `handleFormSubmit` includes logic to validate fields, excluding specific `trust_banner_data` fields.
        *   Uses `MainSection` component for the primary form content.
        *   Initial flex value for the form column is `1 1 200px` and for the preview column is `0 1 500px`.
    *   **19/11/2025, 21:11:54:**
        *   Adjusted the flex values for the two columns: form column changed to `1 1 300px` and preview column to `0 1 300px`. This makes the form section slightly wider and the preview section narrower.
    *   **19/11/2025, 21:12:22:**
        *   Reverted flex values back to `1 1 200px` for the form column and `0 1 500px` for the preview column, matching the 21:10:01 version.
    *   **19/11/2025, 21:12:29:**
        *   Re-adjusted flex values: form column to `1 1 300px` and preview column to `0 1 500px`. This keeps the form section wider than the initial state, but gives more space to the preview compared to 21:11:54.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` (20/11/2025, 18:44:34, 18:44:55, 18:49:44, 18:49:50):**

        *   Implements a `processProductBasedShippingData` function to manage shipping rules.
        *   Allows mapping rules to existing shipping IDs.
        *   Configures calculation methods (override/add onto base shipping), price multiplier, and combination with weight-based shipping.
        *   Uses `ProductSearch` to add specific products/collections to rules, with checks to prevent adding similar items.
        *   Displays added items in a table with delete functionality.
        *   **A specific change in 18:44:55** is that the `price` field type changed from `inputNumber` to `input`.
    *   **20/11/2025, 18:49:44 & 18:49:50:**
        *   The `price` input field now includes an `onKeyPress` event handler to ensure only numbers and dots (`.`) are entered, reinforcing numeric input validation despite being type `input`.
        *   Again, these two timestamps contain identical code, suggesting minor, non-functional saves.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` (21/11/2025, 11:50:18 & 11:51:40):**
    *   A utility file containing various helper functions.
    *   The content is identical across both timestamps, indicating no functional changes.
    *   Functions include:
        *   `getDynamicSearchFilters`: Creates dynamic filter options.
        *   `formatDateString`: Formats date strings.
        *   `setCurrencySymbol` and `formatAmount`: Manages global currency symbol and formats amounts (replacing 'T' with 'K' in numbers for 'compact' notation, though the comment suggests it works for any symbol).

        *   `disabledDate`, `disabledTime`: General date/time disabling logic.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Gokwik UI Kit & Utilities:** Almost all `.tsx` files heavily rely on `gokwik-ui-kit` components for consistent UI and `@gokwik/utilities` for common helper functions (e.g., `makeAPICall`, `updateBreadcrumbs`).
2.  **Merchant Configuration:** The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is frequently used (`BrandPage.tsx`, `FreeGift.tsx`) to manage and save merchant-specific configurations, indicating a centralized system for customizing merchant experiences.
3.  **Form Management:** Ant Design's `Form` component and `Form.useForm()` hook are consistently used for managing form states, validation, and field values. `Form.useWatch` is common for reacting to form value changes.
4.  **Product/Collection Search:** The `ProductSearch` component is a recurring element (`FreeGift.tsx`, `shippingBasedData.tsx`), highlighting the need to select specific products or collections for various settings (discounts, shipping rules). It supports filtering, pagination, and various display options.
5.  **UI Customization:** There's a strong focus on allowing merchants to customize their UI, including branding (logo, colors), order confirmation pages (layout, content, colors), and discount/shipping rule presentation. Color pickers and toggle switches for enabling/disabling features are common.
6.  **Environment Configuration (`.env` & `index.ejs`):** The `.env` files (timestamps 18/11, 20/11, 21/11) show changes in which environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `prod`) is active for API endpoints, by commenting/uncommenting lines. The `index.ejs` file (timestamps 18/11, 20/11, 21/11) repeatedly defines SystemJS import maps, dynamically loading different `@gokwik` micro-frontend applications based on the `deployedEnv` variable (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production). This indicates a micro-frontend architecture for the dashboard.
7.  **New Relic Integration:** The `index.ejs` files include substantial New Relic Browser Agent configuration, indicating a focus on performance monitoring and error tracking across different deployment environments.
8.  **Consistent Timestamp Patterns:** The timestamps for `/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`, `/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/orderConfirmation/index.tsx`, and `/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx` show multiple changes within a very short timeframe (seconds to minutes), suggesting active development, minor adjustments, or repeated saves. The `.env` and `index.ejs` changes also occur close together, typically when switching environments.

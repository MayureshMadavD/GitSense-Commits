For `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx` (Timestamp: 16/11/2025, 13:10:34):
This file introduces a `BrandPage` component for customizing a brand's UI. Key features include logo upload functionality with validation (file type, size), interaction with AWS S3 via pre-signed URLs (`presingedLogoUrl`, `makeAWSPutCall`), and a color picker for selecting the primary theme color. It fetches existing merchant logo and custom CSS configurations on component mount and provides a "Save Changes" button to persist updates through API calls.

For `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:22:51):
An enhanced `ProductSearch` component was implemented, designed for searching and selecting products or collections in contexts like discount or free gift configurations. It features infinite scrolling, debounced search input, a modal for item selection, and robust logic for handling product variants, quantities, and filtering (e.g., `isAgentLed` to exclude 'no-agent' tagged items). It also includes specific handling for "top-up gifts" and quantity validation for collections.

For `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/order-details/index.tsx` (Timestamp: 17/11/2025, 16:23:04):
The order details page received significant updates. Changes include a custom currency formatter (`formatAmountWithCurrency`), improved handling of refund data with a `mergeRepeatedRefunds` function to consolidate multiple attempts, and dynamic calculation of refundable amounts to control the refund button's state. Logic was added to set an "Edit Order" title with conditional messages based on applied rewards or discount types (e.g., Twid rewards, GWP discounts). Price breakup calculations for various discounts, taxes, shipping, and gift cards were also refined.

For `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` (Timestamp: 18/11/2025, 00:45:31):
This `index.ejs` template, acting as the micro-frontend shell for the dashboard, was configured to load various `@gokwik` micro-frontends (e.g., `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/checkout`, `@gokwik/payment`) using `systemjs-importmap`. These import maps are dynamically set based on the `deployedEnv` (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production). It also sets up a Content Security Policy (CSP) and integrates external monitoring tools like Clarity and New Relic for the production environment.

For `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` (Timestamps: 18/11/2025, 00:49:40, 18/11/2025, 00:50:14, 18/11/2025, 00:58:39):
This component manages free gift rules. It provides a form for defining rule details such as name, applicable sales channels, purchase requirements (cart value/quantity), and what the gift applies to (all products, specific products, specific collections). It integrates the `ProductSearch` component for selecting free gift items and applicable products/collections. Rules can be enabled/disabled, edited, or deleted via a table interface. The multiple timestamps for this file with identical content suggest non-functional saves or formatting changes.

For `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/orderConfirmationPage/collapseFields.tsx` (Timestamp: 18/11/2025, 23:42:52):
A new `CustomizeUiFields` component was introduced to enable granular customization of the order confirmation page. It organizes various UI elements (Brand Logo, Dynamic Banners, Trust Banner, Order Details, Customer Information, Support & Communication) into collapsible sections. Each section includes fields for content, color customization via `ColorPickerHelper`, and an enable/disable switch. A significant addition is the drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to reorder these sections on the confirmation page.

For `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/orderConfirmation/index.tsx` (Timestamps: 19/11/2025, 21:10:01, 19/11/2025, 21:11:54, 19/11/2025, 21:12:22, 19/11/2025, 21:12:29):
This file marks the introduction of the main "Order Confirmation Page" settings. It acts as a container for configuring the post-purchase experience, including an overall switch to enable/disable the custom confirmation page and an alert message. It integrates `MainSection` (which likely uses components like `CustomizeUiFields`) for detailed customization and displays an `OrderConfirmationPreview` in a side panel. The `handleFormSubmit` function handles form validation, with specific fields excluded. Minor layout adjustments to the column widths for the form and preview sections were observed across the subsequent timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **UI Customization Focus:** A consistent pattern across multiple files is the extensive focus on customizing the user interface (checkout, brand page, order confirmation page) using `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Form`, `Card`, `Switch`, `ColorPicker`, and dynamic field rendering (`RenderField`).
*   **Merchant Configuration Management:** The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is frequently used for fetching and saving merchant-specific configurations, indicating a centralized approach to managing settings across different dashboard features.
*   **Micro-frontend Architecture:** The dashboard utilizes a `single-spa` micro-frontend architecture, as evidenced by `index.ejs` dynamically loading various `@gokwik` micro-frontends via `systemjs-importmap` based on the deployment environment.
*   **Form-driven UI:** Most configuration pages are built around `gokwik-ui-kit`'s `Form` component, leveraging `Form.useForm()`, `Form.useWatch()`, and validation rules for robust data input and management.
*   **Breadcrumb Navigation:** The `updateBreadcrumbs` utility is consistently used to manage and update navigation paths across different pages.
*   **Component Reusability:** Components like `ProductSearch` and `RenderField` are designed to be generic and reusable across various settings pages.
*   **API Interactions:** `makeAPICall` is the standard utility for backend communication, ensuring consistent data fetching and updates.

# Activity Summary for 06/11/2025

## 09:49:17
The `Dockerfile` located at `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` underwent a series of updates. The file consistently outlines the steps for building a Node.js 20 Alpine-based application, including setting the working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json`, installing dependencies, copying source code, generating the Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting the application. A key change occurred on **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**, where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. Earlier timestamps on **28/10/2025** (12:27:10, 12:27:41, 12:29:42) showed identical content, primarily refining or re-committing the initial Dockerfile setup.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` shows significant development focused on email reporting functionality.
*   On **03/11/2025, 17:38:44**, the initial version shown set up a `POST` endpoint to save daily/weekly report image data to a database using `pngReportData`, and defined asynchronous functions `sendDailyReport`, `sendWeeklyReport`, and `sendEmailForReport` for fetching, formatting, and dispatching reports via `nodemailer`. It also included commented-out `node-cron` schedules for daily and weekly reports.
*   A minute later, on **03/11/2025, 17:39:41**, a minor but specific change was made: the `from` email address in the `mailOptions` for `sendEmailForReport` was updated from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
*   Later on the same day, at **03/11/2025, 18:12:32**, a `console.log(res)` statement was added after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` within the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely to log the email sending response for debugging or verification purposes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The project, identified as "mint-dashboard," is built with Node.js and uses Next.js (indicated by `NextRequest`, `NextResponse`, `next/server`).
*   Database interaction is handled via Prisma, as evidenced by `npx prisma generate` in the `Dockerfile`.
*   There's a strong focus on automated reporting, specifically generating and emailing daily and weekly reports with embedded PNG images. This system relies on `nodemailer` for email sending, `date-fns` for date formatting, and `node-cron` for scheduling (though the cron schedules are commented out in the provided `route.ts` logs, implying they might be managed externally or are pending activation).
*   The `/api/sendemail/route.ts` file imports backend queries (`pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, `deletepngReportData`) and backend services (`getCurrentDate`, `getPreviousDate`), suggesting a structured backend architecture.
*   Significant development activity for the email sending logic occurred on **03/11/2025**, indicating a concentrated effort on this feature around that time.

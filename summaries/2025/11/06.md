# Activity Summary for 06/11/2025

## 09:49:17
The `Dockerfile` located at `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` underwent a series of updates. The file consistently outlines the steps for building a Node.js 20 Alpine-based application, including setting the working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json`, installing dependencies, copying source code, generating the Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting the application. A key change occurred on **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**, where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. Earlier timestamps on **28/10/2025** (12:27:10, 12:27:41, 12:29:42) showed identical content, primarily refining or re-committing the initial Dockerfile setup.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` shows significant development focused on email reporting functionality.
*   On **03/11/2025, 17:38:44**, the initial version shown set up a `POST` endpoint to save daily/weekly report image data to a database using `pngReportData`, and defined asynchronous functions `sendDailyReport`, `sendWeeklyReport`, and `sendEmailForReport` for fetching, formatting, and dispatching reports via `nodemailer`. It also included commented-out `node-cron` schedules for daily and weekly reports.
*   A minute later, on **03/11/2025, 17:39:41**, a minor but specific change was made: the `from` email address in the `mailOptions` for `sendEmailForReport` was updated from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
*   Later on the same day, at **03/11/2025, 18:12:32**, a `console.log(res)` statement was added after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` within the `sendEmailForReport` function, likely to log the email sending response for debugging or verification purposes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The project, identified as "mint-dashboard," is built with Node.js and uses Next.js (indicated by `NextRequest`, `NextResponse`, `next/server`).
*   Database interaction is handled via Prisma, as evidenced by `npx prisma generate` in the `Dockerfile`.
*   There's a strong focus on automated reporting, specifically generating and emailing daily and weekly reports with embedded PNG images. This system relies on `nodemailer` for email sending, `date-fns` for date formatting, and `node-cron` for scheduling (though the cron schedules are commented out in the provided `route.ts` logs, implying they might be managed externally or are pending activation).
*   The `/api/sendemail/route.ts` file imports backend queries (`pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, `deletepngReportData`) and backend services (`getCurrentDate`, `getPreviousDate`), suggesting a structured backend architecture.
*   Significant development activity for the email sending logic occurred on **03/11/2025**, indicating a concentrated effort on this feature around that time.

## 10:49:18
The code changes primarily involve two files: a Dockerfile for application containerization and an API route for sending email reports.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**
    *   **Timestamp:** The Dockerfile underwent several minor iterations on **28/10/2025** and a more notable change on **29/10/2025, 23:35:21**.
    *   **Content:** This Dockerfile outlines the build process for a Node.js 20 Alpine-based application. It sets up a working directory, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` for dependency installation, copies the application code, generates a Prisma schema, builds the application, exposes port 3000, and defines the start command.
    *   **Changes:** The initial versions on 28/10/2025 were identical, using `RUN npm install -f`. The significant change occurred on 29/10/2025, where `RUN npm install -f` was updated to `RUN npm install`, removing the "force" flag from the dependency installation command.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** All changes for this file occurred on **03/11/2025**, with updates at **17:38:44, 17:39:41, and 18:12:32**.
    *   **Content:** This server-side Next.js API route (`"use server"`) handles two main functionalities:
        1.  A `POST` endpoint to save image data, header information, and report type (daily/weekly) to a database using `pngReportData`.
        2.  A `GET` endpoint that triggers `sendDailyReport`.
        *   It contains asynchronous functions (`sendDailyReport`, `sendWeeklyReport`, `sendEmailForReport`) that retrieve report data, format dates using `date-fns`, and send email reports using `nodemailer`. Email content includes an embedded PNG image. Database functions `getPngReportByTodayDate` and `deletepngReportData` are used to manage report data.
        *   Cron job scheduling for daily and weekly reports is present but commented out.
    *   **Changes:**
        *   At **17:39:41**, the sender email address in `sendEmailForReport` was updated from `"integration-noreply@gokwik.co"` to `"integration-noreply@gokwik.in"`.
        *   At **18:12:32**, a `console.log(res)` statement was added after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)` within the `sendEmailForReport` function to log the email sending response.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Refinement:** Changes across both files are generally small, focused on refining existing functionality rather than introducing major new features. This suggests an iterative development process.
*   **Timestamp Grouping:** Changes to the Dockerfile are grouped on specific days (28th/29th October), and all observed changes to `sendemail/route.ts` are clustered within a short period on 3rd November, indicating dedicated work sessions on these components.
*   **Environment Variable Reliance:** The `sendemail/route.ts` file heavily relies on environment variables (`process.env.EMAIL_HOST`, `process.env.PORT_NO`, `process.env.SMTP_EMAIL`, `process.env.SMTP_PASS`, `process.env.PARENT_EMAIL`) for configuring email sending, highlighting a standard practice for managing sensitive or configurable settings.
*   **Consistent Application Structure:** Both files belong to a `mint-dashboard` project, suggesting a dashboard application that needs to be deployed (Dockerfile) and sends reports (sendemail API).

## 10:50:46
The log details significant development activity across several UI components and configuration files, primarily focusing on discount management, shipping rules, and upsell features within a `Gokwik Dashboard` application.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/.env`**
    *   **30/10/2025, 16:50:38**: Switched the active environment to `sandbox`, commenting out `dev` and `qa` configurations.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:02:20**: Changed the active environment from `sandbox` to `qa`.
    *   **03/11/2025, 15:54:08**: Reverted the active environment back to `sandbox`.
    *   **06/11/2025, 09:46:12**: No functional change; active environment remains `sandbox`.
    *   **06/11/2025, 09:57:43**: Switched the active environment from `sandbox` back to `qa`.
    *   *Pattern*: Frequent toggling of active development/testing environments (`sandbox` and `qa`).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **30/10/2025, 16:50:46**: Initial appearance or minor update. This HTML template configures `systemjs-importmap` for various environments (`isLocal`, `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`), loading different module URLs for `@gokwik` services. It also includes New Relic and Clarity analytics scripts.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:02:32**: For the `isLocal` environment, the `@gokwik/utilities` module URL was updated from `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` to `qa.gokwik.in`.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:03:18**: The `@gokwik/utilities` module URL for `isLocal` was immediately reverted to `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
    *   **03/11/2025, 15:54:21**: The `@gokwik/utilities` module URL for `isLocal` was again updated, this time to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`, aligning with a switch in the `.env` file.
    *   **06/11/2025, 09:59:44**: The module URLs in the `isLocal` environment remain set to `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` for various `@gokwik` modules, indicating a stable configuration for local development regardless of the global `.env` active target.
    *   *Pattern*: Changes in `index.ejs` often followed `.env` environment switches, particularly for `@gokwik/utilities` in the `isLocal` setup, though not always perfectly synchronized.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **30/10/2025, 17:52:43**: Introduced or significantly updated the bulk discount creation component. Key functionality includes form fields for discount title, expiry, total codes, prefix/suffix, code length, and a choice between random code generation or CSV file upload. The `uploadDiscountCSV` function initially used a commented-out `makeAWSPutCall` and an active `fetch` API for file uploads.
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:19:56**: `uploadDiscountCSV` was modified to uncomment `makeAWSPutCall` (with `includeUserIdHeader: false`) and comment out the `fetch` call, effectively switching the upload mechanism.
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:25:19**: The `uploadDiscountCSV` function's core logic (`makeAWSPutCall` and `fetch`) was commented out, effectively disabling the actual file upload process.
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:25:34**: A `console.log("upload")` was added in `uploadDiscountCSV`, and `callBack()` changed to `return callBack()`, still with the core upload logic commented out, indicating debugging.
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:26:49**: `uploadDiscountCSV` was restored to use the `makeAWSPutCall` (with `includeUserIdHeader: false`), removing the `fetch` call.
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:30:51**: `uploadDiscountCSV` was fine-tuned, changing `includeUserIdHeader` for `makeAWSPutCall` from `false` to `true`.
    *   *Pattern*: This file saw frequent, rapid changes in its `uploadDiscountCSV` function, oscillating between different API call methods (`fetch` vs. `makeAWSPutCall`) and debugging states (commenting out functionality, adding `console.log`). This suggests active development and troubleshooting of the file upload feature.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
    *   **30/10/2025, 18:29:20**: Introduced or expanded discount data mapping functions like `requestMapDiscount`, which handles various discount types (`DiscountCodeBasic`, `DiscountCodeBxgy`, `DiscountCodeFreeShipping`) and complex product/collection data structures (`mapProducts`, `mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:05:43**: Significant update to a component for managing product-based shipping rules. It now includes state for `previousShippingId`, logic for rendering `selectedOptions`, and new form fields and columns for rule name, price, mapped shipping ID, calculation method, price multiplier, weight combination, and dynamic product/collection selection using `ProductSearch`.
    *   **01/11/2025, 12:05:18**, **01/11/2025, 12:10:00**, **01/11/2025, 12:11:59**, **01/11/2025, 12:13:01**, **01/11/2025, 12:13:37**, **01/11/2025, 12:16:10**: Multiple minor, likely incidental saves without notable functional changes in the provided snippets.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:09:53**: Initial implementation of the Product Based Shipping settings page. It integrates `processProductBasedShippingData` and includes a form with save/cancel actions. The `handleFormSubmit` logic for `saveConfig` was initially commented out, and rules for `price_multiplier` and `combine_with_weight_based` were initialized.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:10:24**: Minor correction in `handleFormSubmit` for conditionally deleting `shipping_id`.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:10:36**: No functional change; likely an incidental save.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:19:31**: Added `console.log(shippingPrices)` and explicitly commented out `saveConfig`, further indicating active debugging.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:20:57**: Added a `return` statement after the `console.log` and commented out post-submission UI updates (`setItemsData`, `setModalOpen`, `form.resetFields`), completely blocking submission.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:26:00**: Modified the logic for handling existing shipping rules during editing, changing a deletion attempt into a `console.log`.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:40:49**: Refined the conditional deletion of `product_based_rules`: if only one rule exists, the property is deleted; otherwise, no action is taken. Still blocked from saving.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:42:13**: Minor null-safety improvement in the `deleteProductShipping` logic.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:47:19**: Attempted to implement more specific deletion logic for individual rules within a shipping ID when there are multiple, filtering by rule name (with a potentially flawed `delete deleteMatchingRule.product_based_rules` syntax).
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:47:40**: The `saveConfig` call was uncommented, and the `return` statement and UI update comments were removed, making the feature functional.
    *   **31/10/2025, 23:49:18**: Corrected the deletion logic to `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]`, indicating an intent to remove a specific matched rule.
    *   **01/11/2025, 12:00:33**: No functional change; likely an incidental save.
    *   **01/11/2025, 12:01:32**: Improved rule name comparison for deletion logic by adding `.trim()` for robustness.
    *   **01/11/2025, 12:04:22**: No functional change; likely an incidental save.
    *   *Pattern*: This file shows a clear progression from initial implementation to detailed debugging and refinement of the `handleFormSubmit` logic, specifically around conditional deletion and eventually enabling data persistence.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`**
    *   **03/11/2025, 11:41:24**: Introduced a comprehensive Free Gift settings page. This component allows configuring rules based on sales channels, purchase type, min/max cart values, and applicability (all, specific products, specific collections). It supports selecting a free gift product (with quantity and price), choosing an addition method (auto/selection), and managing these rules through a table with enable/disable switches and edit/delete actions.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/tieredDiscounts.tsx`**
    *   **03/11/2025, 16:16:44**: Introduced or significantly updated the tiered discounts configuration. It manages prepaid discounts with various methods (e.g., CC/DC), lower/upper order limits, discount values, capping amounts, and optional freebies. The component includes functionality for adding, deleting, and inline editing of discount tiers, along with validation.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
    *   **03/11/2025, 16:19:20**: Enhanced validation logic, particularly `validateTieredDiscount`. New checks were added to prevent overlapping tiers and ensure consistency of freebie products within common ranges.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **04/11/2025, 10:41:02**: Introduced or updated a mobile UI preview component. It dynamically renders various checkout stages (brand, login, payments, checkout elements, address, coupons) based on user selections and configuration data, including dynamic display of coupon offers or skeletons.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **04/11/2025, 12:02:47**: Added `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId`, an API utility function to fetch detailed product variant or collection information by their IDs. This function maps and processes the fetched data for use in UI components.
    *   **04/11/2025, 12:02:59**, **04/11/2025, 12:03:31**: No functional change; likely incidental saves.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:29:02**: Removed the `validateGstData` function and introduced `getAndDeleteUpsellData`, a new API utility for fetching upsell configurations.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **04/11/2025, 12:03:46**: Added new API endpoints: `getVariantById`, `getCollectionById` (to support the new API utility), `validateGstData`, and `setGstData`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:28:25**: Removed the `validateGstData` and `setGstData` endpoints. Added a new `upsellCheckout` object with `getandDeleteUpsellData` and `updateUpsellData` endpoints.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **05/11/2025, 20:01:43**: Integrated the `ProductBasedShipping` component as a new tab within the main shipping settings. This change enabled a multi-tab interface for different shipping configuration types (method, product-based, weight-based, discount-based).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:31:23**: Initial implementation of `UpsellFormRenderer`, a component designed to render individual upsell rule forms. It dynamically builds form inputs for rule title, item count, "applicable on" criteria (all products, specific collections, specific products) via `ProductSearch`, "select upsell products" criteria, and discount configuration. It includes a `useEffect` to initialize form fields based on existing data, converting backend data to UI-friendly radio button and checkbox states.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:31:50**: Updated `useEffect` dependency to `[upsellRules]`, ensuring re-evaluation when the parent component's `upsellRules` change.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:42:51**: Refactored logic to use `useCallback` for deriving applicable rule types (`currentApplicableRule`, `currentProductRule`), aiming for consistency.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:43:40**: Reverted the `useCallback` changes.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:46:34**: Refactored to derive `applicableRule` and `applicableRuleOnProducts` from the specific `currentRule` properties (e.g., `_rule_applicable_on`), making radio button state more explicit. Also simplified hidden input fields.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:48:40**: Added null checks in `useEffect` for `applicableRuleOnProducts` and `discountedPrice` to prevent overwriting existing form state unnecessarily.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:49:20**, **05/11/2025, 22:50:11**, **05/11/2025, 22:50:35**: Multiple minor, likely incidental saves.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:55:03**: Added `console.log(upsellRules)` in `useEffect` for debugging.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:59:44**: Reverted the null-check logic in `useEffect`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:00:06**: Changed `useEffect` dependency to `[index]`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:00:14**, **05/11/2025, 23:04:20**: Reverted `useEffect` dependency to `[]` and added `console.log`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:04:46**: Corrected `useEffect` dependency to `[upsellRules]`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:07:44**: Refined `Form.useWatch` and `form.setFieldValue` paths to include `[index]`, making them specific to the current rule.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:09:20**: No functional change; likely an incidental save.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:16:26**: Major refactoring of `useEffect` initialization logic: it now prevents re-runs if already initialized and only calls `setFieldValue` if values actually differ, improving performance.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:17:53**: Reverted the advanced `useEffect` optimization, opting for a simpler one-time initialization with `useRef` to prevent re-runs, and ensured the `title` field is set.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:18:17**: No functional change; likely an incidental save.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:22:34**: Minor adjustment to `title` handling in `useEffect` and `RichTextEditor` prop.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:35:54**: Passed `isUseEffectRequired={true}` prop to `RichTextEditor`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:44:28**, **05/11/2025, 23:45:00**: Minor changes to `RichTextEditor` prop `selectedValue`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:46:41**, **05/11/2025, 23:47:02**, **05/11/2025, 23:47:31**, **05/11/2025, 23:47:43**: Type annotation for `ref` updated to `useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)` and further minor saves.
    *   *Pattern*: `upsellFormRenderer.tsx` underwent extensive iterative development, particularly around its `useEffect` hook, to correctly initialize and manage form state for individual upsell rules. This involved numerous adjustments to dependencies, null checks, and the overall logic for synchronizing internal form state with external `upsellRules` data.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:45:26**: Initial implementation of the main Upsell on Checkout configuration page. This component fetches existing upsell rules, normalizes them (adding `_rule_applicable_on`, `_rule_applicable_on_products`, `discounted_price` for form rendering), and uses `UpsellFormRenderer` within an Ant Design `Collapse` component. It includes functionality to add new rules, delete existing ones, and prepare data for submission (cleaning up temporary fields).
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:57:37**: Refactored to manage `upsellItems` directly in state via `buildUpsellCollapse` and changed `handleAddNewUpsellRule` to add new rules to the *beginning* of the list. Removed `accordion` from Collapse.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:58:37**: Added `console.log(updatedRules)` for debugging new rules.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:58:50**: Removed the debugging `console.log`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 22:59:19**: Re-enabled `accordion` functionality for the Collapse component.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:25:13**: `handleFormSubmit` modified to use `form.getFieldsValue(true)` for a deep fetch of all form values for logging.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:31:43**: Attempted to clean up temporary form fields (`invalidKeys`) in `handleFormSubmit` before logging, but with incorrect implementation for property filtering.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:34:11**: Corrected the cleanup logic in `handleFormSubmit` to accurately filter out unwanted properties from `upsell_rules` using `Object.fromEntries`.
    *   *Pattern*: This file represents the orchestration of the upsell feature. Changes track the integration, display, and submission of the complex upsell rule configurations, including refining data handling and debugging the form submission payload.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:38:04**: Introduced the `RichTextEditor` component. This component provides basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline, links), a character limit (64), and handles content changes and paste events. It includes a `Popover` for link input and a conditional `useEffect` based on `isUseEffectRequired` prop to manage `selectedValue`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:39:25**: Made the character counter display conditional on `!isUseEffectRequired`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:41:38**: Made the initial HTML rendering conditional on `!isUseEffectRequired`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:42:01**: Refined the internal `useEffect` when `isUseEffectRequired` is true, to directly update the `contentEditable` div's `innerHTML` only if it differs from `selectedValue`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:42:24**, **05/11/2025, 23:43:49**, **05/11/2025, 23:43:57**: Minor, likely incidental saves.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:46:41**: Added a type annotation `HTMLDivElement | null` to the `ref`.
    *   **05/11/2025, 23:47:02**, **05/11/2025, 23:47:31**, **05/11/2025, 23:47:43**: Further minor, likely incidental saves.
    *   *Pattern*: The `RichTextEditor` was developed with careful consideration for its interaction with parent components, specifically regarding how initial values are populated and how it manages its internal state based on the `isUseEffectRequired` prop.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **06/11/2025, 10:04:25**: Initial appearance of a detailed component for editing abandoned carts. This component provides extensive agent-led functionality, including fetching and managing customer data (phone, email, addresses), cart line items, applying custom discounts/shipping, processing payments (COD, prepaid options), and GST validation. It utilizes `makeAPICall` for various backend interactions and manages a complex `state` object for UI and data flags.
    *   **06/11/2025, 10:05:23**, **06/11/2025, 10:05:28**, **06/11/2025, 10:06:07**, **06/11/2025, 10:06:34**, **06/11/2025, 10:08:00**, **06/11/2025, 10:08:50**, **06/11/2025, 10:09:59**: Multiple minor, likely incidental saves.
    *   *Pattern*: Represents the introduction of a new, highly functional module for abandoned cart management, involving complex data fetching, manipulation, and state management.

**Overall Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Feature Development:** There's a strong pattern of adding new, complex features: Bulk Discounts, Product-Based Shipping, Free Gift, Tiered Discounts, and Upsell on Checkout, along with an Abandoned Cart editing page.
2.  **Environment Management:** Frequent changes in `.env` and `index.ejs` indicate active switching between `sandbox` and `qa` environments for deployment or testing, highlighting a multi-environment setup.
3.  **Iterative Refinement and Debugging:** Several files, especially `createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, and `upsellCheckout.tsx`, show repeated modifications, including commenting out/uncommenting code blocks, adding `console.log` statements, and refining conditional logic (especially in `useEffect` hooks). This suggests an iterative development process involving significant testing and bug fixing.
4.  **API Integration:** New API endpoints are consistently added in `apiEndpoints.ts` and corresponding utility functions in `api.ts` to support the new UI features (e.g., for product/collection details, upsell configurations, GST data).
5.  **Form Management with Ant Design:** The widespread use of `gokwik-ui-kit` (likely Ant Design based) `Form` component, `Form.useWatch`, and dynamic form field rendering (`RenderField`) indicates a consistent approach to building complex, data-driven forms.
6.  **Data Normalization and Transformation:** Components like `upsellCheckout.tsx` and `upsellFormRenderer.tsx` explicitly handle data normalization (`_rule_applicable_on` fields) to better fit the UI's form structure, indicating a separation between backend data models and frontend representation.
7.  **Component Reusability:** Components like `ProductSearch` are reused across different features (bulk discounts, free gift, upsell, abandoned cart, shipping) for consistent product/collection selection. The `RichTextEditor` is also introduced as a reusable UI element.

The development log primarily details changes across a Dockerfile and an email sending API route, with multiple iterations indicating active development.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**
    *   Across 28/10/2025, multiple entries show a consistent Dockerfile configuration. It's set up to build a Node.js 20 Alpine application, defining the working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package.json` for caching, installing dependencies, copying source code, generating Prisma schema, building the app, exposing port 3000, and starting the application.
    *   A notable change occurred on 29/10/2025, 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`, removing the force flag.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**
    *   This file was introduced and extensively modified on 03/11/2025. It implements a server-side route for handling daily and weekly report emails.
    *   The `POST` endpoint saves base64-encoded image data, header names, and a report ID to a backend database using `pngReportData`, identifying reports as "daily" or "weekly".
    *   Functions `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` are defined to fetch report data, format dates using `date-fns`, and send emails with embedded PNG images via `sendEmailForReport`. `sendDailyReport` also includes a step to delete `pngReportData` after sending.
    *   The `sendEmailForReport` function uses `nodemailer` to send emails, configured with SMTP settings from environment variables.
    *   Cron job schedules (`node-cron`) for daily and weekly reports are present but commented out, suggesting scheduled functionality might be under development, testing, or externally triggered.
    *   A `GET` endpoint exists to trigger `sendDailyReport` manually, likely for testing purposes.
    *   On 03/11/2025, 17:39:41, the `from` email address in `sendEmailForReport` was updated from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
    *   Further, on 03/11/2025, 18:12:32, a `console.log(res)` was added after the `transporter.sendMail` call in `sendEmailForReport`, indicating debugging efforts for email delivery.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **29/10/2025, 23:35:21:** Modification in the Dockerfile, changing `npm install -f` to `npm install`.
*   **03/11/2025, 17:38:44:** Initial robust implementation of the `/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file, setting up the email reporting logic.
*   **03/11/2025, 17:39:41:** A quick follow-up change in `sendemail/route.ts` adjusting the email's "from" address.
*   **03/11/2025, 18:12:32:** Another immediate change in `sendemail/route.ts`, adding a debug `console.log` for email sending.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The `Dockerfile` maintains a consistent structure for a Node.js 20 Alpine application, focusing on caching `package.json` and including Prisma schema generation.
*   The email reporting logic (`sendemail/route.ts`) shows a pattern of saving report data (PNG images) to a database, retrieving it, and then sending it out via email, often with a cleanup step.
*   There's a clear emphasis on automating reports (daily/weekly) using external libraries like `date-fns` for formatting and `node-cron` for scheduling (even if commented out).
*   Frequent, quick iterations on the `sendemail/route.ts` file within a short timeframe on 03/11/2025 suggest active debugging and refinement of the email functionality.

## 11:50:24
The log entries detail changes across several frontend and configuration files for a `dashboard-checkout` project.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
This EJS template configures the Gokwik Dashboard's microfrontend setup, dynamically loading different `@gokwik` services based on `isLocal` or `deployedEnv` variables.
*   **30/10/2025, 16:50:46**: The initial state defines import maps for various `@gokwik` services (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, kwikpass, rto, kwikship, ellora, checkout-platform, shopify-app) for local, dev, QA, sandbox, and production environments. Locally, `@gokwik/utilities` points to `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:02:32**: The URL for `@gokwik/utilities` in the `isLocal` environment block was updated to `https://qa.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js`.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:03:18**: The `@gokwik/utilities` URL for `isLocal` was further modified to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js`.
*   **03/11/2025, 15:54:21**: The `@gokwik/utilities` URL in the `isLocal` environment was reverted to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js`.
*   **06/11/2025, 09:59:44**: The `@gokwik/utilities` URL for `isLocal` was again set to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js`, matching the state from 31/10, 23:03:18.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx`**
This React component manages the creation of bulk discount codes, allowing for random generation or CSV file uploads.
*   **30/10/2025, 17:52:43**: Initial implementation includes form fields for discount details and an `uploadDiscountCSV` function that uses a `fetch` call for uploading.
*   **30/10/2025, 18:19:56**: The `uploadDiscountCSV` function was updated to use `makeAWSPutCall` instead of a direct `fetch` call, setting `includeUserIdHeader` to `false`.
*   **30/10/2025, 18:25:19**: The `makeAWSPutCall` within `uploadDiscountCSV` was commented out, and `callBack()` was called directly after getting the presigned URL, effectively skipping the actual upload logic temporarily.
*   **30/10/2025, 18:25:34**: A `console.log("upload")` was added and `return callBack()` was explicitly stated in `uploadDiscountCSV`.
*   **30/10/2025, 18:30:51**: The `makeAWSPutCall` in `uploadDiscountCSV` was uncommented again, with `includeUserIdHeader` set to `true`, reversing previous changes.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts`**
This file handles API interactions and data transformations for discount configurations.
*   **30/10/2025, 18:29:20**: The file contains functions for mapping collection and product IDs, fetching product details, and transforming discount data structures for various discount types (e.g., `requestMapDiscount`). It includes logic to compare product arrays and generate lists for additions or removals during updates.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/productBasaedShipping.tsx`**
This component handles the configuration of product-based shipping rules.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:09:53**: Initial version of the `ProductBasedShipping` component, displaying existing rules and providing a form for new ones. It leverages `processProductBasedShippingData` for form and table setup.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:10:24**: In `handleFormSubmit`, a conditional check (`if (formValues?.shipping_id && 'shipping_id' in formValues)`) was added before deleting `formValues.shipping_id`.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:10:36**: Minor formatting adjustments.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:19:31** to **31/10/2025, 23:26:00**: During this period, the `saveConfig` call and associated state updates in `handleFormSubmit` were commented out (for debugging), and a `console.log(shippingPrices)` was added. Attempts were made to adjust deletion logic, including commenting out the deletion of `product_based_rules` property.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:40:49**: Logic to handle deletion of `product_based_rules` was refined: if the array has only one rule, the property is deleted; otherwise, no action is taken. `saveConfig` remained commented out.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:42:13**: Small syntax refinement using optional chaining (`?.`) for `deleteProductShipping?.product_based_rules`. `saveConfig` was still commented out.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:47:19**: Introduced an attempt to filter and delete a specific rule from `product_based_rules` if its length is greater than one. This deletion logic (`delete deleteMatchingRule.product_based_rules`) was incorrect. `saveConfig` remained commented out.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:47:40**: The `saveConfig` call and subsequent state resets were uncommented, re-enabling the saving functionality, despite the potentially flawed deletion logic.
*   **31/10/2025, 23:49:18**: The incorrect deletion logic `delete deleteMatchingRule.product_based_rules` was changed to `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]`, which is also problematic as `deleteMatchingRule` is an array.
*   **01/11/2025, 12:00:33**: No significant functional changes.
*   **01/11/2025, 12:01:32**: The comparison for deleting matching rules was updated to use `trim()` on rule names for accuracy.
*   **01/11/2025, 12:04:22**: No significant functional changes.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/shipping/shippingBasedData.tsx`**
This file processes and prepares data structures for product-based shipping rules, including UI aspects like form fields and table columns.
*   **01/11/2025, 12:05:18**: Initial implementation of `processProductBasedShippingData`, including state for `itemsData` and `previousShippingId`, data mappers, memoized select options, and definitions for table columns (`itemColumnData`) and form fields (`fields`). It sets up `ProductSearch` components for adding/removing products/collections.
*   **01/11/2025, 12:10:00** to **01/11/2025, 12:16:10**: Multiple minor changes, likely formatting or small refactorings without altering core functionality.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`**
This component handles the configuration of automatic free gift rules.
*   **03/11/2025, 11:41:24**: Implements form fields for defining free gift rules (name, sales channels, purchase requirements, applicable products/collections, gift quantity/price, application method, selection limit), along with a table to display existing rules with status toggles and edit/delete actions.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/tieredDiscounts.tsx`**
This component configures tiered discounts.
*   **03/11/2025, 16:16:44**: Provides UI and logic for adding, editing, and deleting tiered discount rules. It includes form fields for payment method, discount code, type, order limits, value, freebies, and RTO actions. The component also handles filtering out 'cod' and 'ppcod-upi' payment methods from prepaid discounts.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
This file defines validation logic for various discount types.
*   **03/11/2025, 16:19:20**: Contains functions like `validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, `validateBuyXatYDiscount`, `validateDiscountCapping`, and `validateGWP`. `validateTieredDiscount` checks for unique codes, valid and non-overlapping price/quantity ranges, and ensures consistency for freebie products across tiers.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
This component provides a preview of the mobile checkout UI based on customization settings.
*   **04/11/2025, 10:41:02**: Implements a mobile layout preview, displaying elements like logo, checkout progress, banners (with autoplay), coupon input, available offers (with skeleton loading), and payment options. It reacts to `tabs` props to highlight the active section and fetches `trustBannerData` conditionally.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
This file centralizes API utility functions.
*   **04/11/2025, 12:02:47** to **04/11/2025, 12:03:31**: Provides functions to fetch Shopify collections/products, update merchant data, get variant/collection details by ID, and validate GST data. These changes were minor formatting adjustments.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:29:02**: A new `getAndDeleteUpsellData` async function was added to fetch upsell configuration data from a specific endpoint.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
This file defines a comprehensive list of API endpoints.
*   **04/11/2025, 12:03:46**: Contains a wide range of API endpoints for dashboard functionalities, including analytics, discounts, orders, and Shopify integrations. It had entries for `validateGstData` and `setGstData`.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:28:25**: A new `upsellCheckout` object was added, including `getandDeleteUpsellData` and `updateUpsellData` endpoints, indicating the introduction of upsell configuration features.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
This component acts as a container for various shipping-related configuration tabs.
*   **05/11/2025, 20:01:43**: Organizes different shipping configuration modules (Shipping Method, Product Based Shipping, Weight Based Shipping, Discount Based Shipping) into a tabbed interface. It dynamically renders tabs based on the presence of shipping configuration data.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**
This component renders the form for a single upsell rule within the upsell configuration.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:31:23**: Initial implementation, uses `Form.useWatch` for reactive fields and an `useEffect` to initialize radio buttons and discount settings based on incoming data.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:31:50**: Changed `useEffect` dependency to `[upsellRules]`, causing it to re-run frequently.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:42:51**: Briefly experimented with `useCallback` for rule derivation, then reverted.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:43:40** to **05/11/2025, 23:04:46**: Iterations around the `useEffect` dependencies and internal logic for initializing `rule_applicable_on`, `rule_applicable_on_products`, and `discounted_price` based on `upsellRules` data. This period shows attempts to handle edge cases like `null` values for `Form.useWatch` and to ensure consistent form field updates.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:07:44** to **05/11/2025, 23:09:20**: Crucially, `Form.useWatch` and `form.setFieldValue` calls were updated to correctly reference the specific `index` of the upsell rule in the `upsell_rules` array, making the component properly handle individual rules in a list.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:16:26**: Introduced `useRef(false)` for `hasInitialized` within `useEffect` to prevent re-running initialization logic unnecessarily on subsequent renders, and added logic to only `setFieldValue` if the value actually differs. This is a significant optimization for form performance.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:17:53** to **05/11/2025, 23:22:34**: The `useEffect` initialization logic was further streamlined to directly set form values for `rule_applicable_on`, `rule_applicable_on_products`, `title`, and `discounted_price` based on the fetched rule, relying on `hasInitialized` for single execution.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:35:54**: Added `isUseEffectRequired={true}` prop to the `RichTextEditor` for the rule title, indicating that the RichTextEditor itself needs to react to `selectedValue` changes using its own `useEffect`.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:44:28** to **05/11/2025, 23:47:43**: The RichTextEditor `selectedValue` prop was correctly populated with `upsellRules?.[index]?.title`, ensuring proper display of the initial title in the editor.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**
This component serves as the main interface for managing upsell configurations at checkout.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:45:26**: Initial implementation, fetching upsell data via `getAndDeleteUpsellData`, transforming it with internal fields (`_rule_applicable_on`, `_rule_applicable_on_products`), and displaying rules in a collapsible list using `UpsellFormRenderer`. It includes functions to add/delete rules and a submit handler that attempts to clean up internal fields.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:57:37**: The direct data transformation in `useEffect` was removed and replaced with a `buildUpsellCollapse` helper function to generate collapse items. New rules are now initialized with empty objects/arrays for `applicable_items`, `upsell_items`, `upsell_product_list`.
*   **05/11/2025, 22:58:37** to **05/11/2025, 22:59:19**: Minor adjustments, including the removal of a `console.log` statement and changes to `Collapse` component props (`accordion` and `destroyInactivePanel`).
*   **05/11/2025, 23:25:13**: The `handleFormSubmit` function was updated to use `form.getFieldsValue(true)` to retrieve all form values, including internal ones, before processing.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:31:43**: An attempt was made to filter out "invalid keys" from the upsell rules before submission, but the implementation was flawed, trying to filter an array of objects directly based on keys.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:34:11**: The `handleFormSubmit` logic was correctly refactored to filter out internal form-related keys from each upsell rule object, ensuring only relevant data is prepared for submission.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**
This is a rich text editor component.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:38:04**: Initial implementation for a `RichTextEditor` component, supporting bold, italic, underline, and link formatting. It features a 64-character limit, HTML processing (adding `target="_blank"` to links, specific class to bold text), and a modal for link input.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:39:25** to **05/11/2025, 23:41:38**: Conditional rendering of the character count and initial `span` content was introduced, dependent on the `isUseEffectRequired` prop.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:42:01** to **05/11/2025, 23:47:31**: The `useRef` for the editable div was explicitly typed as `HTMLDivElement | null`. The `useEffect` for `isUseEffectRequired` was refined to directly update `editor.innerHTML` more robustly, and some minor formatting/dependency adjustments occurred.
*   **05/11/2025, 23:47:43**: No significant functional change.

**Summary of Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **Microfrontend Configuration Adjustments:** Frequent changes in `index.ejs` indicate ongoing development and environment-specific configuration management for microfrontends, particularly for the `@gokwik/utilities` service endpoint. This suggests active testing and deployment to different environments (sandbox, QA, production).
2.  **AWS S3 Upload Refinements:** The `createBulkDiscounts.tsx` file shows an iterative process of refining file upload logic, switching between `fetch` and a custom `makeAWSPutCall` utility, and adjusting headers, suggesting active development and debugging of file handling, likely involving AWS S3.
3.  **Complex Form State Management:** `upsellFormRenderer.tsx` and `upsellCheckout.tsx` demonstrate a detailed and evolving approach to managing dynamic and nested form states. This includes:
    *   **Conditional `Form.useWatch`**: Using `useWatch` to react to specific indexed paths for individual form rules.
    *   **Careful `useEffect` Initialization**: Employing `useEffect` with `useRef` (e.g., `hasInitialized`) to ensure form fields are correctly initialized only once from existing data, and then only updated when explicit changes occur, preventing unnecessary re-renders.
    *   **Data Transformation for API**: Stripping internal UI-specific fields (like `_rule_applicable_on`) before submitting data to the API, highlighting the need to separate UI state from backend payload structure.
4.  **Debugging and Code Stability:** Several files (e.g., `productBasaedShipping.tsx`) show commented-out code, `console.log` statements, and `return` statements that temporarily halt execution. This indicates periods of active debugging and incremental development, where features are tested and refined before full integration. This also extends to bug fixes in array manipulation for deletions (e.g., `delete deleteMatchingRule[0]` vs. correct filtering).
5.  **API Endpoint Expansion:** The `apiEndpoints.ts` file reflects the introduction of new features, such as "Upsell On Checkout," by adding new API endpoints.
6.  **Minor Refinements:** Numerous commits across different files involve minor syntax adjustments, whitespace changes, and the addition of helper functions or utility calls, demonstrating continuous code cleanup and optimization efforts.

The codebase is undergoing active development, particularly in areas concerning UI customization, bulk discount management, shipping rule configuration, and a new upsell feature, with developers actively addressing form state complexities and API integration challenges.

## 12:49:15
The `Dockerfile` for the `mint-dashboard` project remained largely consistent across several updates. The primary change occurred on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm ci` to `RUN npm install`. Other timestamps for this file (28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 28/10/2025, 12:27:41; 28/10/2025, 12:29:42) showed no functional changes to the build process, which involves using `node:20-alpine`, setting `/app` as the working directory, installing `openssl`, copying `package.json`, installing dependencies, copying source code, generating Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting the application with `npm start`.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` underwent several focused updates on 03/11/2025.
*   **Initial version (03/11/2025, 17:38:44):** This significant update introduced functionality for saving and sending daily and weekly email reports.
    *   It defines a `POST` endpoint to save image data, header names, and report IDs (daily or weekly) using a `pngReportData` function.
    *   It includes `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` asynchronous functions to retrieve report data, format dates using `date-fns`, filter reports, and invoke `sendEmailForReport`. `sendDailyReport` also calls `deletepngReportData` after sending.
    *   The core email sending logic resides in `sendEmailForReport`, which utilizes `nodemailer` to create a transport using environment variables for SMTP host, port, user, and password. It constructs an HTML email with an embedded base64 PNG image attachment and sends it to `process.env.PARENT_EMAIL` from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co".
    *   A `GET` endpoint is also present, which triggers `sendDailyReport()` and returns a status, implying a mechanism for manual or scheduled trigger verification.
    *   Notably, `node-cron` is imported, and commented-out `cron.schedule` blocks are present for daily and weekly reports, suggesting an intention for automated scheduling in the future.
*   **Subsequent updates:**
    *   On 03/11/2025, 17:39:41, the sender email address in `sendEmailForReport` was changed from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in".
    *   On 03/11/2025, 18:12:32, a `console.log(res)` statement was added after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)` within the `sendEmailForReport` function, indicating a debug or logging addition to monitor the email sending response.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The `Dockerfile` indicates a stable and standardized build process for the application, with only a minor refinement in dependency installation.
*   The `sendemail/route.ts` file shows active development around email reporting functionality, with clear steps for data handling, report generation, and sending via `nodemailer`. The presence of commented-out `node-cron` schedules points to an ongoing effort to implement automated daily and weekly report delivery. The `from` email address change and added logging suggest iterative testing and refinement of the email sending mechanism.

## 12:50:12
The provided log details code changes across several files within a `dashboard_checkout` project, spanning from October 30, 2025, to November 06, 2025. This summary excludes entries related to `.env` files, as per instructions.

This included refining `useEffect` logic for `selectedValue` synchronization, conditional rendering of character count, and specifying the `ref` type to `HTMLDivElement | null`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Iterative Development and Debugging:** A prominent pattern is the rapid, successive changes (often within minutes) in several component files (`createBulkDiscounts.tsx`, `productBasaedShipping.tsx`, `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, `upsellCheckout.tsx`, `richtexteditor.tsx`). This indicates active development cycles, frequent testing, and debugging, often involving temporary `console.log` statements or commenting out `saveConfig` calls.
*   **Ant Design Forms & Hooks:** Extensive use of `Form.useForm()` and `Form.useWatch()` (implied from `gokwik-ui-kit`) is common across many React components for managing complex form states and reactivity.
*   **Microfrontend Architecture:** The `dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file consistently uses `single-spa` and `systemjs-importmap` to load different microfrontends based on the deployment environment, highlighting a modular application structure.
*   **API Integration:** The `@gokwik/utilities` package, specifically `makeAPICall` and `makeAWSPutCall`, is a recurring dependency for interacting with backend services.
*   **Data Transformation:** Several files (`discounts/api.ts`, `api.ts` utilities) are dedicated to mapping and transforming data between UI structures and API payloads, especially for complex entities like discount rules, products, and collections.
*   **Feature Expansion:** The log shows active development around several features: bulk discounts, product-based shipping, free gifts, tiered discounts, and a newly introduced "Upsell On Checkout" feature, which saw the most intense recent development.
*   **Environment-Specific Configuration:** The `index.ejs` file shows a consistent pattern of loading different module URLs (e.g., `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`, `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`) based on the `deployedEnv` variable.

## 13:49:17
The changes log focuses on two main files: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**

*   **Summary of Updates:** This Dockerfile is used to build a Node.js 20 Alpine application. It sets up the working directory, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` for caching, installs dependencies, copies the application code, generates the Prisma schema, builds the application, exposes port 3000, and specifies the start command.
*   **Significant Change (29/10/2025, 23:35:21):** The initial `npm install -f` command for installing dependencies was changed to `npm install`. The previous entries on 28/10/2025 were identical, suggesting the primary Dockerfile structure was established then, with a minor adjustment to the dependency installation command later.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**

*   **Summary of Updates:** This file implements an API route for handling email reports. It uses `nodemailer` to send daily and weekly reports, likely containing images (`imageData`). It integrates with a backend query service (`pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, `deletepngReportData`) and `date-fns` for date formatting. It also includes commented-out `node-cron` schedules for automated daily and weekly report generation, suggesting an intention for scheduled tasks.
*   **Significant Change (03/11/2025, 17:39:41):** The `from` email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function was updated from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in". This is a minor but specific modification to the sender domain.
*   **Significant Change (03/11/2025, 18:12:32):** Logging was added to the `sendEmailForReport` function. Specifically, `console.log(res)` was introduced after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` to log the result of the email sending operation. The remaining code for POST and GET endpoints, and the `sendDailyReport`/`sendWeeklyReport` logic, remained consistent across these timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Dependency on `process.env`:** Both files implicitly rely on environment variables (e.g., `process.env.EMAIL_HOST`, `process.env.PORT_NO`, etc.), indicating configuration is externalized.
*   **Email Reporting Focus:** The `sendemail/route.ts` file shows a strong focus on generating and sending email reports, complete with embedded images and structured subjects.
*   **Development Activity Dates:** The Dockerfile changes occurred on October 28th and 29th, suggesting initial setup or minor refinements to the build process. The `sendemail/route.ts` file saw concentrated activity on November 3rd, indicating active development, debugging, and refinement of the email functionality around that time.
*   **Consistent File Paths:** All changes occur within the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/` directory, suggesting work within a single project.
*   **Node.js Ecosystem:** The project clearly uses Node.js (Node.js 20 Alpine base image, `npm` commands, `nodemailer`, `next/server`, `node-cron`). Prisma is also used for schema generation, indicating a database-driven application.

## 14:49:16
The `Dockerfile` for the `mint-dashboard` project remained largely stable across multiple updates between 28/10/2025 and 29/10/2025.
*   **Dockerfile:** The initial versions (28/10/2025, 12:27:10; 12:27:41; 12:29:42) consistently define a build process using `node:20-alpine` as the base image. It sets the working directory to `/app`, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json`, runs `npm install -f`, copies the application code, generates the Prisma schema (`npx prisma generate`), builds the application (`npm run build`), exposes port 3000, and starts the application with `npm start`. A subtle change occurred on 29/10/2025 at 23:35:21, where the dependency installation command was modified from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`, removing the force flag.

The `app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file saw several updates on 03/11/2025, primarily focusing on email reporting functionality.
*   **`/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`:**
    *   The first logged version on 03/11/2025 at 17:38:44 introduced a robust email sending mechanism. It includes a `POST` endpoint to save image data (daily/weekly reports) into a backend database via `pngReportData`. It defines asynchronous functions `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` which retrieve report data, format dates using `date-fns`, and send emails using `sendEmailForReport`. `sendDailyReport` also calls `deletepngReportData` after successfully sending an email. The `sendEmailForReport` function utilizes `nodemailer` to send emails with embedded PNG images, configuring the transporter with environment variables for host, port, user, and password. Initially, emails were sent from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co". The file also includes a `GET` endpoint that triggers `sendDailyReport` and returns a status. Notably, `node-cron` imports and commented-out `cron.schedule` blocks indicate an intention for scheduled reports, though these schedules are not active in the provided code snippets.
    *   A minor modification on 03/11/2025 at 17:39:41 updated the `from` email address in `sendEmailForReport` from `"integration-noreply@gokwik.co"` to `"integration-noreply@gokwik.in"`.
    *   Further refining the email sending process, on 03/11/2025 at 18:12:32, `console.log(res)` was added after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` in the `sendEmailForReport` function to log the response from the email transporter.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The project consistently uses Node.js 20 Alpine for its Docker environment.
*   `npm install` and `npm run build` are standard steps in the Docker build process.
*   The email sending functionality heavily relies on `nodemailer` and `date-fns`, indicating a requirement for formatted, image-rich email reports.
*   Environment variables (e.g., `EMAIL_HOST`, `PORT_NO`, `SMTP_EMAIL`, `SMTP_PASS`, `PARENT_EMAIL`) are utilized for external service configurations, particularly for email, suggesting a focus on secure and configurable deployments.
*   The use of `cron` (even if commented out) suggests a design for scheduled tasks within the application.
*   There's a clear separation of concerns, with API routes handling incoming requests and dedicated functions for email logic and backend queries.

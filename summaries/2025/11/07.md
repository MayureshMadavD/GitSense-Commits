# Activity Summary for 07/11/2025

## 00:49:16
The changes across these files primarily focus on UI customization, upsell rule management, and abandoned cart editing within a checkout dashboard application.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 05/11/2025, 23:43:57 and 05/11/2025, 23:47:31
        *   Minor changes, possibly formatting or whitespace, between these two timestamps. The actual code appears largely identical.
    *   **Timestamp:** 05/11/2025, 23:46:41 and 05/11/2025, 23:47:02
        *   The `ref` variable's type declaration was updated from `useRef(selectedValue)` to `useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)`. This change provides a more explicit type for the ref and initializes it to `null`, which is a common pattern for DOM element refs. The `textCount` state initialization also changed from `ref?.current || ''` to the same, reflecting this ref type change. This suggests a refinement in how the RichTextEditor interacts with its DOM element.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 05/11/2025, 23:44:28 and 05/11/2025, 23:45:00
        *   The initialization of `selectedValue` for the `RichTextEditor` component was updated. It now explicitly checks if `upsellRules?.[index]?.title` exists, and if not, it defaults to the placeholder text `'Enter Text To Update'`. This improves the user experience by providing a clear prompt when no title is present.
    *   **Timestamp:** 05/11/2025, 23:45:00 and 05/11/2025, 23:47:43
        *   No significant code changes were observed between these two timestamps, suggesting minor edits like whitespace or re-saves.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 09:59:44 and 06/11/2025, 11:22:01
        *   In the `isLocal` environment configuration, the URL for `@gokwik/utilities` was changed from `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js`. This indicates a shift in the local development environment to fetch utilities from the sandbox dashboard instead of QA.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 10:04:25 to 06/11/2025, 16:13:17
        *   Across these multiple timestamps, the only observable change is the addition of two new state properties in the `state` object: `abcUrl: null` and `isCheckoutLink: false`. This suggests the introduction of functionality related to abandoned cart URLs or checkout links, possibly for generating or tracking them. Other timestamps within this range show identical code, implying frequent saving without substantial changes.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 23:24:11 to 06/11/2025, 23:34:43
        *   No significant code changes were observed in this file across these timestamps. This indicates routine saving or minor, unrecorded changes.
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 23:44:38 and 06/11/2025, 23:53:46
        *   A `products` array was introduced, containing sample product data with `id`, `product_id`, `product_name`, `product_thumbnail_url`, `totalVariants`, `variants`, and `minPrice`. This array appears to be for demonstration or testing purposes within the `MobileStepUI` component. The `console.log(customizeUiData?.upsell_data)` was also added.
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 23:53:46 to 07/11/2025, 00:29:43
        *   No significant code changes were observed in this file across these numerous timestamps, suggesting frequent saves or minor, unrecorded edits. The `console.log(customizeUiData?.upsell_data)` line remains.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/upsellCheckout/index.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 23:37:58
        *   This file was introduced or updated, importing `MobileStepUI` and `UpsellForCheckout`. It sets up a layout with two columns, one for `UpsellForCheckout` and the other for `MobileStepUI` with specific `tabs`, `couponsData`, and `checkoutElementData` props (all initialized to `[]` for `MobileStepUI`). This suggests integration of the upsell configuration alongside a mobile UI preview.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 07/11/2025, 00:36:29 and 07/11/2025, 00:40:49
        *   A new property, `is_upsell_enabled: false`, was added to the `upsell_data` object in the initial state. This indicates the introduction of a feature toggle for the upsell functionality.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 07/11/2025, 00:42:32
        *   This file shows significant updates related to upsell rule management.
        *   It now integrates `updateUpsellState` from Redux to dispatch the `is_upsell_enabled` status based on `config?.cart_upsell?.enabled` with a debounce.
        *   The `buildUpsellCollapse` function now displays an "Alert" message for each rule (e.g., "Rule 1"), making it easier to identify rules.
        *   The `handleFormSubmit` function was enhanced to remove specific keys (`discounted_price`, `products`, `rule_applicable_on`, `rule_applicable_on_products`, `upsell_product_list`) before pushing upsell data, implying a cleanup or transformation of data sent to the API. It also includes validation via `validateUpsellRules`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **UI Customization Focus:** Several files (`richtexteditor.tsx`, `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, `mobilePage.tsx`) are consistently updated, indicating an ongoing effort to refine the user interface and customization options within the checkout dashboard.
*   **Upsell Feature Development:** A strong recurring theme is the development and refinement of upsell features, including their UI configuration (`customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`, `upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, `upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`) and underlying state management (`store/customize-ui/index.ts`).
*   **Frontend Technologies:** The use of React, Redux, and Ant Design components (`gokwik-ui-kit` which likely wraps Ant Design) is consistent across the UI-related files.
*   **API Interaction:** The `editAbcCart.tsx` file shows a pattern of interacting with a backend API for fetching and creating customer, address, and abandoned cart data.
*   **Environment Configuration:** The `.env` and `index.ejs` files are periodically updated to reflect changes in API base URLs and import map configurations, typically for switching between `dev`, `qa`, and `sandbox` environments.
*   **Detailed Timestamps:** The timestamps are highly specific, often within seconds or a few minutes of each other, especially for `.tsx` files. This could indicate rapid iterative development, frequent saves, or automated tooling.
*   **Refinement of State Management:** There's a clear pattern of refining state management for UI components, such as making ref types more explicit in `richtexteditor.tsx` or introducing an `is_upsell_enabled` flag in the Redux store for upsell functionality.
*   **Preview Functionality:** The `mobilePage.tsx` component is consistently updated to accurately reflect changes in UI customization, indicating a dedicated preview mode for various checkout steps (brand, login, payments, address, coupons).

The log entries primarily demonstrate active development on frontend features, particularly around UI customization for checkout and upsell flows, with regular updates to API configurations and Redux state structures to support these features.

## 00:49:23
The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` shows consistent configuration for a Node.js 20 Alpine image. It sets the working directory, installs `openssl`, copies `package*.json` for caching, installs dependencies, copies the application code, generates the Prisma schema, builds the application, exposes port 3000, and defines the start command. A significant change occurred on `29/10/2025, 23:35:21`, where the `npm install -f` command was modified to `npm install`, removing the `--force` flag.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file, first appearing on `03/11/2025, 17:38:44`, implements an API route for handling and sending email reports.
*   It features a `POST` endpoint to save daily or weekly report image data, header information, and report dates using backend query functions (`pngReportData`).
*   The file contains `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` functions that fetch reports, format dates using `date-fns`, and use `sendEmailForReport` to send emails. The `sendDailyReport` also triggers a `deletepngReportData` call upon successful email sending.
*   The `sendEmailForReport` function leverages `nodemailer` to send emails with embedded PNG images, configured with SMTP details from environment variables. The email subject line includes "MINT {headerName} {reportType} Report {date}".
*   Initially, the `from` email address was `integration-noreply@gokwik.co`. This was updated on `03/11/2025, 17:39:41` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
*   Cron job schedules for daily and weekly reports using `node-cron` are present but commented out within the file, suggesting that automation might be handled externally or triggered via the `GET` endpoint defined in the same file.
*   A further update on `03/11/2025, 18:12:32` added `console.log(res)` after sending the mail in `sendEmailForReport`, likely for debugging purposes to inspect the response from the email transporter.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   **Application Build Process:** The Dockerfile consistently outlines a standard build process for a Node.js application, including dependency management with npm, Prisma ORM schema generation, and a production build.
*   **Automated Reporting System:** The `sendemail/route.ts` file highlights a core feature of an automated email reporting system, capable of generating daily and weekly reports with embedded images.
*   **External Configuration:** The extensive use of `process.env` in `sendemail/route.ts` for database connections (implied by Prisma generation in Dockerfile), email host, port, and authentication details indicates a design pattern focused on external configuration via environment variables.
*   **Debugging Practices:** The addition of a `console.log` statement in a critical function (`sendEmailForReport`) suggests an iterative development or troubleshooting approach.
*   **Next.js API Routes & Backend Services:** The file path structure (`app/api/.../route.ts`) and imports from `../../../backend/query` and `@/backend/backendservice` indicate the use of Next.js API routes integrated with custom backend services for data interaction.
*   **Date Formatting:** The `date-fns` library is consistently used for formatting dates, ensuring uniform date presentation in reports.

## 11:35:46
The repository features a `Dockerfile` and an API route for sending emails, `/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**
This Dockerfile defines the build process for a Node.js 20 Alpine application.
*   **Initial state (28/10/2025, 12:27:10)**: The Dockerfile was set up to install Node.js dependencies using `npm install -f`, generate a Prisma schema, build the application, and expose port 3000.
*   **Minor adjustment (29/10/2025, 23:35:21)**: The command for installing Node.js dependencies was changed from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. Otherwise, the build steps remained consistent across all logged changes for this file.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**
This file implements a Next.js API route for handling email reports, using `nodemailer`, `date-fns`, and `node-cron`.
*   **Initial version (03/11/2025, 17:38:44)**:
    *   A `POST` endpoint saves image data (`imageData`), header (`headerName`), and `reportId` (1 for daily, 2 for weekly) to a database via `pngReportData`.
    *   A `GET` endpoint triggers the `sendDailyReport()` function.
    *   Functions `sendDailyReport()` and `sendWeeklyReport()` are responsible for fetching relevant report data, formatting dates, and calling `sendEmailForReport()`. `sendDailyReport()` also calls `deletepngReportData()` upon successful email dispatch.
    *   The `sendEmailForReport()` function configures a Nodemailer transporter using environment variables (`EMAIL_HOST`, `PORT_NO`, `SMTP_EMAIL`, `SMTP_PASS`) to send HTML emails with embedded PNG images. The initial sender email was `integration-noreply@gokwik.co`.
    *   Cron job scheduling for daily and weekly reports is present but commented out, suggesting manual triggering or future activation.
*   **Minor sender email update (03/11/2025, 17:39:41)**: The `from` email address in `sendEmailForReport` was updated from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
*   **Logging addition (03/11/2025, 18:12:32)**: A `console.log(res)` statement was added within the `sendEmailForReport` function to log the response from `transporter.sendMail()`, likely for debugging purposes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**
*   The `Dockerfile` consistently uses `node:20-alpine` and follows a standard pattern for Node.js application deployment (install dependencies, generate Prisma schema, build, start).
*   The `sendemail/route.ts` file heavily relies on environment variables for email configuration, indicating sensitive information is managed externally.
*   The email sending logic involves embedding PNG images as report content, distinguishing between daily and weekly reports, and managing report data persistence through backend queries.
*   There's a recurring pattern of commenting out cron job schedules, implying that scheduled email delivery might be a planned feature or is triggered by another mechanism.
*   Timestamp patterns show initial setup/minor fixes for the Dockerfile on **October 28-29, 2025**, followed by more focused development and debugging on email functionality in `sendemail/route.ts` on **November 03, 2025**.

## 11:36:00
The changes log details updates across UI components, state management, and build configurations within a checkout dashboard application, all occurring on June 11th and 12th, 2025 (06/11/2025 and 07/11/2025).

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   Across multiple timestamps from 06/11/2025, 16:20:08 to 16:38:20, the provided content for this file remains identical. It outlines a React component `editAbcCart` responsible for managing abandoned cart details, including fetching and creating customer data and addresses, handling shipping details, and initiating order creation. It uses `useLocation` and `useParams` for routing context, Redux for state (`getMerchantDetails`), and `makeAPICall` for API interactions. State variables manage various aspects like customer details, shipping data, discounts, and modal visibility.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   At 06/11/2025, 23:18:38, the `index.ejs` file (an HTML template) was modified or committed. This file configures the application's runtime environment, including global scripts (`regenerator-runtime`, `single-spa`), Content Security Policy (CSP), and environment-specific import maps for various `@gokwik` microfrontends (e.g., `@gokwik/configuration`, `@gokwik/utilities`, `@gokwik/checkout`). It also includes New Relic and Microsoft Clarity scripts for production monitoring, indicating a robust deployment and observability setup.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   This React component (`MobileStepUI`) for previewing mobile UI customization saw several updates from 06/11/2025, 23:24:11 to 07/11/2025, 01:32:32.
    *   Initially, it set up state for active tabs (brand, login, payments, checkoutElement, address, coupons) and data for trust banners and recommended offers, dynamically displaying content based on `customizeUiData` from Redux.
    *   At 06/11/2025, 23:44:38, a hardcoded `products` array was temporarily introduced within the component, likely for testing or placeholder purposes.
    *   By 07/11/2025, 00:16:38, this hardcoded `products` array was removed, and the component began sourcing product list data (`listOfProducts`) dynamically from `customizeUiData?.upsell_data?.upsell_product_list?.products?.data`, specifically when an `isUpsellCall` prop is true. This change signifies a shift towards integrating actual upsell product data from the Redux store into the UI preview.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/upsellCheckout/index.tsx`**
    *   This component (`UpsellOnCheckout`) was updated between 06/11/2025, 23:37:58 and 07/11/2025, 01:00:05.
    *   At 07/11/2025, 00:53:09, the `MobileStepUI` component rendered here was updated to receive a new prop `isUpsellCall={true}`, enabling the dynamic loading of upsell products in the preview.
    *   At 07/11/2025, 01:00:00, a `useEffect` hook was added to update breadcrumbs upon component mounting, enhancing navigation context for the user.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   At 07/11/2025, 00:40:49, a new property `is_upsell_enabled: false` was added to the `upsell_data` object in the `initialState`. This new boolean flag likely provides a mechanism to globally enable or disable the upsell functionality.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**
    *   This component, responsible for upsell configuration, appears consistent across its entries from 07/11/2025, 00:42:32 to 00:59:48. It fetches and manipulates upsell rules, allowing users to add, edit, delete, and reorder them via a form interface. It integrates with `useMerchantConfigApi` for saving configurations and dispatches `updateUpsellState` to the Redux store, including a debounced update for `is_upsell_enabled`. It features a collapsible UI for individual rules and a deletion confirmation modal.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**
    *   At 07/11/2025, 01:01:10, this component renders the detailed form for configuring individual upsell rules. It uses `Form.useWatch` to react to form changes and dispatches updates to the Redux store. A `useEffect` hook handles the initial loading and setting of form fields by fetching variant and collection details. The form allows customization of the rule's title (using `RichTextEditor`), item count limit, and includes a `ProductSearch` component for defining which products or collections the rule applies to, as well as selecting the actual upsell products. It also provides conditional fields for configuring discounted prices.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Redux for State Management:** The application extensively uses Redux (`@reduxjs/toolkit`, `useSelector`, `useDispatch`) for managing global UI state, particularly evident in the `customize-ui` slice and its interactions with `mobilePage.tsx`, `upsellCheckout.tsx`, and `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`.
*   **`gokwik-ui-kit` Usage:** Ant Design-like components (e.g., `Button`, `Card`, `Col`, `Row`, `Form`, `Input`, `InputNumber`, `Carousel`, `Skeleton`, `Modal`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`) are consistently used across the UI components, indicating a shared component library.
*   **API Interaction:** Components frequently utilize `makeAPICall` and specific API endpoints (`APIEndPoints.getCustomer`, `APIEndPoints.createCustomer`, `APIEndPoints.createAddress`, `getAndDeleteUpsellData`, `pushUpsellData`) for data fetching and persistence.
*   **UI Customization and Preview:** There's a clear emphasis on customizing and previewing checkout UI elements, especially with the introduction of upsell features. The `MobileStepUI` acts as a central preview mechanism.
*   **Component Modularity:** `RenderField` and `ProductSearch` are reusable components that abstract common UI patterns, promoting maintainable code.
*   **Breadcrumb Navigation:** The `updateBreadcrumbs` utility is used to maintain a consistent navigation trail within the application.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** Components frequently adjust their rendering based on state (`activeTab`, `couponScreen`, `discountedPrice`, `isUpsellCall`), allowing for dynamic and flexible UI.
*   **Time-Sensitive Development:** All log entries fall within a narrow window of two days, suggesting focused development on checkout customization and upsell features.

## 12:35:49
The log details changes across two primary files: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**

*   **Initial Configuration (28/10/2025, between 12:27:10 and 12:29:42):** The Dockerfile was consistently configured to build a Node.js application using `node:20-alpine`. Key steps include setting the working directory to `/app`, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json` for dependency installation, copying the entire application, generating the Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and starting the application with `npm start`. The dependency installation initially used `npm install -f`.
*   **Dependency Installation Adjustment (29/10/2025, 23:35:21):** A notable change occurred where the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. This removes the force flag, indicating a shift towards a standard dependency installation process.

**File: `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**

*   **Initial Implementation of Email Reporting (03/11/2025, 17:38:44):** This file was introduced to manage email reporting. It utilizes `nodemailer` for email sending and `date-fns` for date formatting.
    *   A `POST` endpoint handles saving report image data (daily or weekly) along with a header and report ID to a database via `pngReportData`.
    *   It includes `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` asynchronous functions. These functions retrieve report data, format it, and send emails using `sendEmailForReport`. The `sendDailyReport` also calls `deletepngReportData` after sending the email.
    *   `sendEmailForReport` is a core function that sets up a `nodemailer` transporter using SMTP details from environment variables (host, port, user, pass). It creates an HTML email embedding a base64 encoded PNG image. The initial sender email was "integration-noreply@gokwik.co".
    *   Commented-out `node-cron` schedules for daily and weekly reports suggest an intent for automated, time-based report sending, although these are currently inactive.
    *   A `GET` endpoint exists, which directly triggers `sendDailyReport` and returns a status, possibly for testing or manual invocation.
*   **Email Sender Domain Update (03/11/2025, 17:39:41):** The sender email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function was updated from "integration-noreply@gokwik.co" to "integration-noreply@gokwik.in".
*   **Email Sending Response Logging (03/11/2025, 18:12:32):** A `console.log(res)` statement was added after `transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)` within `sendEmailForReport`, likely to log the response from the email server for debugging purposes.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focus on Automated Reporting:** A significant pattern is the development and refinement of an automated system for generating and sending daily and weekly reports, primarily involving image data embedded in emails.
*   **Iterative Development:** Changes are often small and incremental, such as adjusting a command flag, updating an email domain, or adding a logging statement, indicating a continuous and iterative development process.
*   **Use of Environment Variables:** Both `Dockerfile` (implicitly through application runtime) and `sendemail/route.ts` explicitly rely on environment variables for sensitive configurations like database connections and email credentials, which is a standard practice for secure and flexible deployments.
*   **Next.js API Routes:** The structure of `app/api/sendemail/route.ts` indicates the use of Next.js API routes for server-side logic, including `POST` and `GET` methods.

## 12:35:58
The provided log details recent development activity across several files related to a checkout dashboard UI. The primary focus appears to be on customizing the checkout experience and implementing upsell functionalities.

**File-specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`** (06/11/2025, 16:27:23 to 16:38:20): No code changes were observed across these timestamps for this file. It consistently contains a React component (`editAbcCart`) responsible for managing abandoned cart details. This component handles customer information, addresses, line items, and various API calls for customer creation, address management, and order creation. It utilizes a wide array of UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and local utilities.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`** (06/11/2025, 23:18:38 to 07/11/2025, 12:08:15): The import map for the `isLocal` development environment was updated. Specifically, the `@gokwik/utilities` module's source URL changed from `sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` to `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`. Other `@gokwik` modules within the `isLocal` block also consistently point to the `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` domain, suggesting a shift in the local development environment configuration to use QA environment dependencies more broadly.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`** (06/11/2025, 23:24:11 to 07/11/2025, 01:32:32): This React component (`MobileStepUI`) is responsible for rendering a mobile UI preview based on customization settings.
    *   Initially (06/11/2025, 23:24:11), it used a small, hardcoded `products` array for demonstration purposes.
    *   By 06/11/2025, 23:53:46, the hardcoded `products` array was significantly expanded with more detailed Shopify-like product data, and a `listOfProducts` variable was introduced, conditionally populated based on an `isUpsellCall` prop.
    *   A temporary syntax error in a `console.log` statement was introduced around 07/11/2025, 00:11:45 and quickly resolved by 07/11/2025, 00:11:51.
    *   The hardcoded `products` array was removed by 07/11/2025, 00:16:38, making `listOfProducts` solely dependent on `customizeUiData`.
    *   The `isUpsellCall` prop was formally added to the component's interface and used in the `listOfProducts` derivation (07/11/2025, 00:53:40).
    *   A minor logical operator reordering for `listOfProducts` was applied around 07/11/2025, 01:05:50.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/upsellCheckout/index.tsx`** (06/11/2025, 23:37:58 to 07/11/2025, 01:00:05): This page component (`UpsellOnCheckout`) orchestrates the display of upsell configuration and its mobile preview.
    *   The `MobileStepUI` component initially received only basic props.
    *   An `isUpsellCall={true}` prop was added to `MobileStepUI` by 07/11/2025, 00:53:09, signaling its use in an upsell context.
    *   A `useEffect` hook was introduced by 07/11/2025, 01:00:00, to manage breadcrumb navigation, specifically adding "Checkout Settings" and "Upsell On Checkout" entries.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`** (07/11/2025, 00:36:29 to 00:40:49): A new property `is_upsell_enabled: false` was added to the `upsell_data` object within the Redux `initialState`. This addition provides a central flag for enabling/disabling the upsell feature globally in the UI customization settings.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`** (07/11/2025, 00:42:32 to 00:59:48): This component (`UpsellForCheckout`) manages the configuration of upsell rules.
    *   It dispatches `updateUpsellState` to the Redux store, reflecting the `cart_upsell.enabled` status (07/11/2025, 00:42:32).
    *   The `useEffect` hook responsible for `updateBreadcrumbs` was removed (07/11/2025, 00:59:48), indicating a refactoring where breadcrumb management is likely handled at a higher level in the component hierarchy.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`** (07/11/2025, 01:01:10): This new or recently added component (`UpsellFormRendererComponent`) provides dynamic form rendering for individual upsell rules. It uses `Form.useWatch` to react to form changes, `RichTextEditor` for title input, `InputNumber` for item count, and `ProductSearch` for selecting applicable products/collections. It initializes form fields by fetching variant and collection details and sets the `rule_applicable_on` based on selected items.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **React and Ant Design:** The codebase heavily relies on React for UI development and `gokwik-ui-kit` (likely an Ant Design wrapper) for UI components such as `Row`, `Col`, `Button`, `Card`, `Carousel`, `Form`, `Input`, `InputNumber`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Collapse`, `Modal`.
*   **Redux for State Management:** Redux Toolkit is used for managing application-wide state, specifically for UI customization data (`customizeUiData`) and its various sub-sections (brand, login, payment, upsell).
*   **API Interaction:** Multiple components (`editAbcCart`, `upsellCheckout`) make asynchronous API calls using `makeAPICall` to fetch and update data, including customer details, addresses, and upsell configurations.
*   **UI Customization Feature Development:** A prominent theme is the ongoing development of UI customization features, particularly for checkout flow elements and the integration of upsell rules, which include rich text editing and product/collection selection.
*   **Modular Architecture:** The use of separate components for different functionalities (e.g., `MobileStepUI` for preview, `UpsellForCheckout` for overall upsell configuration, `UpsellFormRenderer` for individual rule editing) suggests a modular approach to development.
*   **Navigation Management:** Breadcrumbs are consistently updated across relevant pages, indicating a structured approach to user navigation within the dashboard.

## 13:35:46
The changes primarily affect two files: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`. No summary is generated for `.env` files as per the instructions.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**
    *   **Timestamps:** Updates occurred on 28/10/2025 (12:27:10, 12:27:41, 12:29:42) and 29/10/2025 (23:35:21).
    *   **Updates:** The initial three logs for this file on 28/10/2025 show identical content, indicating minor saves or metadata changes without code alteration. A significant change occurred on 29/10/2025, where the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. The rest of the Dockerfile's structure and commands (Node.js 20 Alpine base, WORKDIR, `apk add openssl`, `COPY package*.json`, `COPY . .`, `npx prisma generate`, `npm run build`, `EXPOSE 3000`, `CMD ["npm", "start"]`) remained consistent across all logged versions.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps:** All changes occurred on 03/11/2025 (17:38:44, 17:39:41, 18:12:32).
    *   **Updates:**
        *   The first logged version (17:38:44) established the core functionality for sending daily and weekly reports, processing image data, and using Nodemailer. The `from` email address in `mailOptions` was initially set to `"integration-noreply@gokwik.co"`.
        *   A minor change at 17:39:41 updated the `from` email address domain from `gokwik.co` to `gokwik.in` (`"integration-noreply@gokwik.in"`).
        *   The final update at 18:12:32 added a `console.log(res)` statement within the `sendEmailForReport` function, specifically after `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)`, to log the result of the email sending operation. This indicates an addition for debugging or monitoring email delivery status.
    *   **Functionality:** The file consistently implements a Next.js API route (`/api/sendemail`) with a POST endpoint to save PNG report data and a GET endpoint to trigger daily reports. It uses `nodemailer` for email, `date-fns` for date formatting, and integrates with backend services for data retrieval and deletion. Commented-out `node-cron` schedules are present for daily and weekly report generation, suggesting future or disabled automation.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Application Structure:** The `Dockerfile` maintains a standard setup for a Node.js application, including dependency installation, Prisma schema generation, and application build/start commands.
*   **Email Reporting Logic:** The `sendemail/route.ts` file consistently handles saving image reports and sending daily/weekly email summaries, formatting dates, and embedding base64 encoded images.
*   **Focus on Email Configuration and Debugging:** The changes in `sendemail/route.ts` indicate an iterative process of refining email sender details and adding logging for reliability.
*   **Rapid Iteration on 03/11/2025:** There was intense development activity on 03/11/2025 related to the email sending functionality, with multiple updates in a short span.
*   **Security Concern Handling:** The explicit instruction to not summarize `.env` files highlights an awareness of sensitive data, which is a good practice in development and operations.

## 13:35:51

The content remains identical, focusing on a React component `editAbcCart` for managing abandoned cart details. It handles customer fetching, creation, address management, and order creation. Key elements include state management (`useState`, `useRef`), API calls using `@gokwik/utilities`, and UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit`.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs**
    *   **Timestamps:** 06/11/2025, 23:18:38 and 07/11/2025, 12:08:15
    *   **Content:**
        *   **06/11/2025, 23:18:38:** This EJS template defines the base HTML structure for the Gokwik Dashboard. It includes meta tags (charset, viewport, CSP), a favicon, a `regenerator-runtime` script, and a `systemjs-importmap` for shared dependencies (React, ReactDOM, single-spa). It also sets `window.fcWidgetMessengerConfig`. Different import maps are conditionally loaded based on `isLocal`, `deployedEnv` (dev, qa, sandbox, production), specifying URLs for various `@gokwik` micro-frontend modules. A New Relic browser monitoring script is present for the 'production' environment.
        *   **07/11/2025, 12:08:15:** The `isLocal` import map configuration for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` was updated to point to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` instead of `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in`. The `deployedEnv==='dev'` block now includes `@gokwik/kwikcomm`. The `deployedEnv==='qa'` block now includes `@gokwik/kwikcomm`. The `deployedEnv==='sandbox'` block has been removed from the provided snippet. The general structure, CSP, and shared dependencies remain the same.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx**
    *   **Timestamps:** A continuous series of updates from 06/11/2025, 23:24:11 to 07/11/2025, 01:32:32, with the earliest and latest logs containing identical content across the whole duration.
    *   **Content (General):** This React component (`MobileStepUI`) is responsible for rendering a mobile preview of UI customizations. It manages active tabs (brand, login, payments, checkoutElement, address, coupons), trust banner data, recommended offers, and coupon displays based on `customizeUiData` from a Redux store. It simulates a checkout flow with different UI states.
    *   **Specific Changes within the timeframe:**
        *   **06/11/2025, 23:44:38:** Introduction of a `products` array as a static mock data for product listings, which was removed by the next relevant timestamp.
        *   **07/11/2025, 00:00:51 - 07/11/2025, 00:29:43:** The `products` array from the previous change was re-introduced and remains present.
        *   **07/11/2025, 00:45:52:** Introduction of a `listOfProducts` variable, conditionally assigned `customizeUiData?.upsell_data?.upsell_product_list?.products?.data` if `isUpsellCall` is true.
        *   **07/11/2025, 00:53:40:** The `MobileStepUI` component now accepts `isUpsellCall` as a prop.
        *   **07/11/2025, 01:05:41:** `listOfProducts` initialization modified to explicitly use `|| []` for default empty array.
        *   **Throughout:** The core logic for `activeTab` management, `useEffect` hooks for data loading, and rendering conditional UI elements based on `customizeUiData` and `activeTab` states remains consistent. The numerous changes with identical content indicate frequent saves or minor, non-semantic changes that were not captured.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/upsellCheckout/index.tsx**
    *   **Timestamps:** 06/11/2025, 23:37:58, 07/11/2025, 00:53:09, 07/11/2025, 01:00:00, and 07/11/2025, 01:00:05.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **06/11/2025, 23:37:58:** The `UpsellOnCheckout` component renders `UpsellForCheckout` and `MobileStepUI`. `MobileStepUI` is passed static props (`tabs={1}`, `couponsData={[]}`, `checkoutElementData={[]}`).
        *   **07/11/2025, 00:53:09:** The `MobileStepUI` component is updated to receive an additional prop `isUpsellCall={true}`.
        *   **07/11/2025, 01:00:00 and 07/11/2025, 01:00:05:** An `useEffect` hook is added to manage breadcrumbs, setting "Checkout Settings" and "Upsell On Checkout" paths. This change is consistent between these two timestamps.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts**
    *   **Timestamps:** 07/11/2025, 00:36:29 and 07/11/2025, 00:40:49
    *   **Content:**
        *   **07/11/2025, 00:36:29:** The Redux slice defines initial state for UI customization (`brand_data`, `login_data`, `address_data`, `payment_data`, `button_toogle`, `upsell_data`) and reducers to update these states. The `upsell_data` object initializes various properties related to upsell rules, product lists, and discounts.
        *   **07/11/2025, 00:40:49:** A new property, `is_upsell_enabled: false,` is added to the `upsell_data` object in the `initialState`.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx**
    *   **Timestamps:** 07/11/2025, 00:42:32 and 07/11/2025, 00:59:48.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **07/11/2025, 00:42:32:** This React component (`UpsellForCheckout`) manages upsell rules for checkout. It fetches and displays existing upsell rules, allowing users to add, edit, delete, and reorder them using a `Collapse` component. It integrates with a `useMerchantConfigApi` hook to save changes and dispatches updates to the Redux store via `updateUpsellState`. An `useEffect` hook handles initial data fetching and setting form values based on `config.cart_upsell`. It includes form fields for "Cart Upsell" enablement and "Cap Quantity for Each Upsell SKU". A `Modal` is used for rule deletion confirmation.
        *   **07/11/2025, 00:59:48:** The `useEffect` hook responsible for updating breadcrumbs (seen in the `UpsellOnCheckout` parent component) was removed from this component. This indicates a refactoring to centralize breadcrumb management at a higher level.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx**
    *   **Timestamp:** 07/11/2025, 01:01:10
    *   **Content:** This component renders individual upsell rule forms. It uses `Form.useWatch` to react to changes in `applicableRule` and `discountedPrice`. It contains `useEffect` hooks to initialize form fields based on existing rule data, fetching product/variant/collection details if applicable, and updating the Redux state. It features a `RichTextEditor` for the rule title, an `InputNumber` for item count limit, and `ProductSearch` components for selecting applicable products/collections and upsell items. It also includes a checkbox for discounted pricing with associated input fields for discount value and capping.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx**
    *   **Timestamp:** 07/11/2025, 12:35:59
    *   **Content:** This React component (`FreeGift`) manages free gift settings. It uses a form (`Form.useForm`) to configure rules for free gifts, including sales channels, purchase type (cart value/quantity), minimum/maximum values, applicability (all products, specific products, collections), free gift product selection, quantity, and price. It features a `Table` to display existing rules, with options to edit and delete. A `Switch` component controls the status (enabled/disabled) of each rule. It interacts with `useMerchantConfigApi` for configuration management and dispatches updates to the Redux store.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

1.  **React Functional Components and Hooks:** All `.tsx` files are React functional components heavily utilizing hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, `useLocation`, `useParams`, `useSelector`, and `useDispatch`. This indicates a modern React development approach.
2.  **`gokwik-ui-kit`:** A custom UI library (`gokwik-ui-kit`) is consistently used for components like `Button`, `Card`, `Col`, `Row`, `Form`, `Input`, `InputNumber`, `Modal`, `Carousel`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Switch`, `Table`, `Divider`, `Alert`, and icons (`EditOutlined`, `DeleteOutlined`, `HolderOutlined`). This suggests a standardized design system.
3.  **Redux Integration:** Redux (`react-redux`, `@reduxjs/toolkit`) is used for state management, particularly visible in `customize-ui/index.ts` defining slices and selectors, and components like `mobilePage.tsx` and `upsellCheckout.tsx` interacting with the store (`useSelector`, `useDispatch`).
4.  **API Interaction:** `makeAPICall` (from `@gokwik/utilities`) and `APIEndPoints` (from `@library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints`) are used for network requests, indicating communication with backend services for data persistence (customer, address, order, upsell rules).
5.  **Environment Variables:** Reliance on `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` is consistent across API calls, signifying environment-specific configurations managed via `.env` files.
6.  **UI Customization and Configuration:** A significant portion of the changes revolves around UI customization (`mobilePage.tsx`) and configuration for features like abandoned carts, upsells, and free gifts. This often involves dynamic rendering based on configuration data.
7.  **Breadcrumb Management:** The `updateBreadcrumbs` utility from `@gokwik/utilities` is frequently used to manage navigation paths within the application.
8.  **Product/Collection Search:** `ProductSearch` components are used in multiple settings-related files (`editAbcCart.tsx`, `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, `freeGift.tsx`) suggesting a common mechanism for selecting products or collections.
9.  **Date Formatting and Image Placeholders:** `@library/utilities/helpers/helper` (e.g., `formatAmount`) and `@library/utilities/constants/constants` (e.g., `ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage`, `defaultTrustBannerList`) are used for common utilities and constants.
10. **Consistent Timestamp Formatting:** All timestamps adhere to the format `MM/DD/YYYY, HH:MM:SS`.

## 14:35:44
The provided log details changes across two distinct code files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard` project, primarily focusing on Docker configuration and an email sending API route. It's noteworthy that all timestamps are set in late 2025, suggesting this log might be from a future-dated project or test environment.

Here's a breakdown of the key information:

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**
    *   **Timestamp of significant change:** 29/10/2025, 23:35:21.
    *   **Updates:** The Dockerfile remained largely consistent across multiple entries on 28/10/2025. The only functional change occurred on 29/10/2025 when the dependency installation command was updated from `RUN npm install -f` to `RUN npm install`. The Dockerfile configures a Node.js 20 Alpine image, sets the working directory, installs essential build tools (openssl), copies `package*.json` for caching, installs dependencies, copies the source code, generates the Prisma schema, builds the application, exposes port 3000, and starts the application.
*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**
    *   **Timestamps of significant changes:** 03/11/2025, 17:39:41 and 03/11/2025, 18:12:32.
    *   **Updates:**
        *   Initial version on 03/11/2025, 17:38:44 used `"integration-noreply@gokwik.co"` as the sender email.
        *   A quick update on 03/11/2025, 17:39:41 changed the sender email domain from `.co` to `.in`, specifically `from: "integration-noreply@gokwik.in"`.
        *   Another modification on 03/11/2025, 18:12:32, introduced a `console.log(res)` to output the response from `transporter.sendMail(mailOptions)` within the `sendEmailForReport` function, indicating added debugging or logging.
    *   **Functionality:** This file implements an API route for handling email reports. It supports saving PNG report data via a POST request and sending daily/weekly reports via a GET request (which triggers a daily report sending function). It uses `nodemailer` for email transmission, `date-fns` for date formatting, and `node-cron` for scheduling (though cron schedules are commented out in the provided logs, indicating potential future activation or testing). The email includes an embedded PNG image.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Focused Development Bursts:** Changes appear to be grouped by file and date. Dockerfile changes occurred on October 28th and 29th, while all observed `sendemail/route.ts` changes happened on November 3rd, suggesting dedicated work on different parts of the application at different times.
*   **Email Service Refinements:** The repeated modifications to `sendemail/route.ts` (sender domain change, added logging) indicate active development and debugging of the email reporting functionality.
*   **Consistent Core Logic:** Despite minor tweaks, the core logic within the Dockerfile and the `sendemail/route.ts` remains consistent across its respective entries, focusing on standard application build/run processes and report generation/emailing.

## 14:36:09
The log details ongoing development and refinement across several frontend components and API integrations, primarily centered around new checkout customization features, particularly an "Upsell On Checkout" functionality.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx**
    *   This component, `MobileStepUI`, is a preview interface for different checkout UI states (brand, login, payments, address, coupons).
    *   **06/11/2025, 23:29:37 - 06/11/2025, 23:34:43:** Initial states involve setting active tabs, managing coupon data visibility, and rendering placeholders for various checkout elements.
    *   **06/11/2025, 23:44:38:** Introduces a `products` array with sample data for demonstration, showing product name, image, old/new price, and discount.
    *   **06/11/2025, 23:53:46 - 07/11/2025, 00:03:32:** The sample `products` array is expanded significantly with more realistic product data including Shopify product IDs, variant IDs, thumbnail URLs, and `minPrice`. This suggests a move towards integrating actual product data for previews.
    *   **07/11/2025, 00:53:40 - 07/11/2025, 01:32:32:** A new prop, `isUpsellCall`, is added to `MobileStepUI`. The `listOfProducts` displayed in the preview is now conditionally populated from `customizeUiData?.upsell_data?.upsell_product_list?.products?.data` only when `isUpsellCall` is true. This indicates the component is being adapted to visualize upsell products. The core coupon and tab switching logic remains consistent throughout these changes.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/upsellCheckout/index.tsx**
    *   **06/11/2025, 23:37:58:** Introduces the `UpsellOnCheckout` page, integrating `UpsellForCheckout` (for managing upsell rules) and `MobileStepUI` (for preview).
    *   **07/11/2025, 00:53:09:** The `MobileStepUI` component in the preview section is explicitly passed `isUpsellCall={true}`, signaling its role in showcasing upsell functionality.
    *   **07/11/2025, 01:00:00:** An `useEffect` hook is added to manage breadcrumbs for navigation, standardizing the user's path within the dashboard.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts**
    *   **07/11/2025, 00:36:29:** The Redux store's `initialState` for UI customization is extended to include an `upsell_data` object, containing properties like `item_count_limit`, `rule_applicable_on`, `upsell_product_list`, `discount` configurations, and `applicable_items`. A `updateUpsellState` reducer is added to manage this new data.
    *   **07/11/2025, 00:40:49:** A boolean flag `is_upsell_enabled` is added to the `upsell_data` for toggling the upsell feature.
    *   **07/11/2025, 14:22:25:** A new `is_consent_auto_select: true` property is added to `login_data`.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx**
    *   **07/11/2025, 00:42:32:** This new component, `UpsellForCheckout`, is introduced. It provides the UI for creating, editing, deleting, and reordering upsell rules using a form and `Collapse` elements. It fetches and persists upsell data via API calls and dispatches updates to the Redux store. Drag-and-drop functionality is implemented for reordering rules.
    *   **07/11/2025, 00:59:48:** The breadcrumbs `useEffect` is removed, suggesting its responsibility was moved to a parent component (`UpsellOnCheckout`).

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx**
    *   **07/11/2025, 01:01:10:** This is a newly added component, `UpsellFormRenderer`, designed to render the detailed form for a single upsell rule. It includes a rich text editor for the rule title, input for item count limits, and utilizes `ProductSearch` for selecting specific products or collections to which the rule applies, as well as for selecting the upsell products themselves. It also includes fields for configuring discount values and capping, dynamically appearing based on a `discounted_price` checkbox.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs**
    *   **07/11/2025, 12:08:15:** The `Content-Security-Policy` is updated to include `wss://*.gokwik.io` in `connect-src`. New microfrontend `@gokwik/kwikcomm` is added to the import maps for `dev` and `qa` environments. New Relic browser monitoring scripts are present in the `production` block.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx**
    *   **07/11/2025, 12:35:59:** The `FreeGift` component is responsible for managing free gift rules, including fields for name, sales channels, purchase requirements, applicable products/collections, and free gift product selection.

    *   **07/11/2025, 14:14:44:** This reusable component facilitates searching and selecting products or collections with features like pagination, filtering, and quantity management for specific collections.
    *   **07/11/2025, 14:21:45:** The mechanism for rendering the main action button ("Select products/collections") is refactored. The `buttonText` and `buttonInputProps` are removed, and a new `btnSearch` prop now directly controls the rendering of this button.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts**
    *   **07/11/2025, 14:16:19:** Improves API call reliability and type safety.
        *   `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`: Adds `type FetchParams` for better typing, filters products by 'active' status, and refines data mapping for variants.
        *   `getAndDeleteUpsellData` and `pushUpsellData`: Enhanced with `try-catch` blocks for robust error handling.
        *   `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId`: Updates data mapping for variants, collections, and products to include more comprehensive details.

*   **/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts**
    *   **07/11/2025, 14:16:30:** New endpoints are added under `upsellCheckout`: `getandDeleteUpsellData` and `updateUpsellData`, supporting the new upsell feature.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Upsell Feature Development:** A significant focus is on implementing an "Upsell On Checkout" feature, involving new components (`UpsellForCheckout`, `UpsellFormRenderer`), Redux store updates (`customize-ui/index.ts`), API endpoints (`apiEndpoints.ts`), and integration into the UI preview (`mobilePage.tsx`).
*   **UI Customization and Preview:** The `mobilePage.tsx` acts as a central preview panel, continuously updated to reflect new UI elements and functionalities, such as dynamic product lists for upsells.
*   **Reusable Components:** `ProductSearch.tsx` is a frequently used utility for selecting products or collections across different settings pages (discounts, free gifts, upsell rules), indicating a modular component design.
*   **Redux State Management:** The `customize-ui` Redux slice is actively expanded to accommodate configurations for new features (e.g., `upsell_data`).
*   **API Integration and Data Handling:** There's a consistent pattern of creating specific API endpoints (`apiEndpoints.ts`) and corresponding `makeAPICall` functions (`api.ts`) for new features. Emphasis on better error handling and robust data transformation from API responses is also evident.
*   **User Experience Enhancements:** Minor updates like adding tooltips to form fields (`freeGift.tsx`) demonstrate attention to improving user guidance within the dashboard.
*   **Infrastructure and Deployment:** Updates to `index.ejs` indicate ongoing management of client-side application configuration, microfrontend integration, and external monitoring tools.

## 15:35:42
The provided log details changes across two primary files: `Dockerfile` and `app/api/sendemail/route.ts`. No summary will be generated for `.env` files.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile`**:
    *   Between 28/10/2025 and 29/10/2025, the Dockerfile content remained largely stable, using `FROM node:20-alpine`, setting the working directory to `/app`, installing `openssl`, copying `package*.json`, running `npm install -f`, copying the source, generating Prisma schema, building, exposing port 3000, and starting the application with `npm start`.
    *   A significant change occurred on **29/10/2025 at 23:35:21**: The command `RUN npm install -f` was modified to `RUN npm install`. This indicates a shift from a forced installation of dependencies to a standard installation.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/api/sendemail/route.ts`**:
    *   On **03/11/2025 at 17:38:44**, the initial version of the email sending route was captured. It uses `nodemailer` to send daily and weekly reports as PNG images. The `from` email address was set to `"integration-noreply@gokwik.co"`. Cron job scheduling logic is present but commented out for both daily and weekly reports.
    *   A minor update occurred shortly after on **03/11/2025 at 17:39:41**: The `from` email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function was changed from `"integration-noreply@gokwik.co"` to `"integration-noreply@gokwik.in"`.
    *   Later on **03/11/2025 at 18:12:32**, a debugging or logging improvement was introduced. After the `await transporter.sendMail(mailOptions);` call in the `sendEmailForReport` function, a new line `console.log(res)` was added to log the response from the email transporter.

**Patterns and recurring elements:**

*   **Dockerfile Stability:** The Dockerfile content was highly consistent across multiple commits, with only one functional change observed. This suggests a stable build process configuration.
*   **Email Sending Logic:** The `app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file consistently implements a server-side email sending mechanism using Nodemailer, handling both daily and weekly reports, fetching image data, and using Prisma for backend queries (implicitly via `pngReportData`, `getPngReportByTodayDate`, `deletepngReportData`). The use of `date-fns` for date formatting and `node-cron` for scheduling (though commented out) are also recurring.
*   **Minor Iterative Changes:** Changes in `route.ts` demonstrate iterative refinements, such as adjusting an email domain and adding logging for debugging purposes.
*   **Future Date Timestamps:** All timestamps are set in October and November 2025, indicating that this log might represent planned or simulated changes, or the system clock is set to a future date.

## 15:36:09
The development log primarily details work on the `checkout-dashboard-ui` application, focusing on `customizeUI` pages, `upsellCheckout` functionality, and minor refinements in `free-gift` and `abandoned-cart` sections.

**File-specific updates:**

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**:
    *   **Between 06/11/2025, 23:29:37 and 06/11/2025, 23:34:43**: The component remained stable, providing a preview UI for various checkout stages (brand, login, payments, checkout elements, address, coupons) using `gokwik-ui-kit` components like `Layout`, `Row`, `Col`, `Input`, `Carousel`, and `Skeleton` placeholders.
    *   **At 06/11/2025, 23:59:36**: The `Card` component was newly imported, indicating an intention to incorporate card-based UI elements.
    *   **Between 07/11/2025, 00:10:01 and 07/11/2025, 00:11:51**: A local `products` array with mock data for various items (watches, headphones, apparel, rings) was temporarily added to the component.
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 00:16:38**: The hardcoded `products` array was replaced with dynamic fetching of `listOfProducts` from the Redux store's `customizeUiData?.upsell_data?.upsell_product_list?.products?.data`. This signifies a shift from static mock data to integrated upsell product data.
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 00:53:40**: The `MobileStepUI` component was updated to accept a new `isUpsellCall` prop, and the `listOfProducts` array now conditionally populates itself only when `isUpsellCall` is true. This indicates its adaptation to be reused for upsell previews.
    *   **Minor modifications were made to the component's structure and prop handling repeatedly across various timestamps in the early hours of 07/11/2025**, but the core logic for tabs and data fetching from `customizeUiData` remained consistent.
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 14:23:31**: No significant functional change was noted from the previous entry, suggesting minor formatting or whitespace adjustments.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/upsellCheckout/index.tsx`**:
    *   **At 06/11/2025, 23:37:58**: This new component `UpsellOnCheckout` was introduced, combining `UpsellForCheckout` and `MobileStepUI` for a two-column layout. The `MobileStepUI` was initially passed static `tabs` and empty data arrays.
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 00:53:09**: The `MobileStepUI` component call was updated to pass `isUpsellCall={true}`, explicitly enabling its upsell display functionality.
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 01:00:00**: A `useEffect` hook was added to manage breadcrumbs for the "Upsell On Checkout" page, importing `updateBreadcrumbs` from `@gokwik/utilities`. This breadcrumb management was previously within `UpsellForCheckout.tsx`.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**:
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 00:40:49**: The Redux `upsell_data` state was augmented with a new boolean property, `is_upsell_enabled: false`, providing a global toggle for the upsell feature.
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 14:22:25**: The `login_data` state was updated to include `is_consent_auto_select: true`, adding a configuration for automatic selection of consent on the login page.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**:
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 00:59:48**: The `useEffect` hook that was responsible for updating breadcrumbs was removed from this component, indicating its relocation to a parent component (`UpsellOnCheckout`).

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**:
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 01:01:10**: This component, responsible for rendering individual upsell rule forms, initializes form fields based on existing `upsell_rules` and dispatches updates to the Redux store. It uses `ProductSearch` for item selection and `RichTextEditor` for title editing. No further changes observed in the provided log for this file.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`**:
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 13:37:42**: A `Tooltip` was added to the "Free Gift Quantity" label, providing a descriptive message: 'Quantity of each free product'.
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 13:41:02**: Minor styling was applied to the `Tooltip` in the "Free Gift Quantity" label by adding `className='ml-1'`, and the label itself was wrapped in a `span` with flex properties for better alignment.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**:
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 13:25:53 and 07/11/2025, 13:26:41**: No substantial code changes were observed across these timestamps, suggesting minor edits like whitespace or formatting.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**:
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 14:16:19**: This file defines API functions, including those for fetching product/collection data, updating merchant configurations, and managing upsell data. It was stable through this log.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**:
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 14:16:30**: This file lists various API endpoints used throughout the application, categorized by feature. It remained unchanged in the provided log.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**:
    *   **At 07/11/2025, 14:21:45**: The `hideButton` prop and its associated button rendering logic were removed, simplifying the component's usage.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Upsell Feature Integration**: A significant recurring theme is the development and integration of an upsell feature, affecting multiple components (`mobilePage.tsx`, `upsellCheckout/index.tsx`, `customize-ui/index.ts`, `upsellCheckout.tsx`, `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`). This involves Redux state updates, API calls, and conditional rendering based on upsell-related props.
*   **UI Customization and Preview**: Components like `mobilePage.tsx` are designed to offer a visual preview of UI customizations, adapting dynamically based on selected tabs and data from the Redux store.
*   **Redux State Management**: The `customize-ui` Redux slice is consistently used to manage UI-related configurations, with new properties being added to support evolving features (e.g., `is_upsell_enabled`, `is_consent_auto_select`).
*   **Breadcrumb Consistency**: There's an effort to centralize and manage breadcrumb navigation, exemplified by moving the `updateBreadcrumbs` logic to a higher-level component.
*   **Ant Design (gokwik-ui-kit) Usage**: The widespread use of `gokwik-ui-kit` components (which are likely wrappers around Ant Design components) like `Row`, `Col`, `Button`, `Form`, `Card`, `InputNumber`, `Switch`, `Tooltip`, `Dropdown`, `Radio`, `Checkbox`, `Carousel`, `Skeleton`, `Modal`, etc., is a dominant pattern, indicating a consistent UI library across the dashboard.
*   **Image Imports**: Various SVG images (e.g., `footerImg`, `backQuoteIcon`, `discountSvg`, `noImage`, `discountIcon`, `threeDotsIcon`, `BookDownload`, `Map`, `BreifCase`) are frequently imported, suggesting a rich graphical interface.
*   **API Interactions**: Components frequently interact with a `makeAPICall` utility, using predefined `APIEndPoints` for fetching and updating data.
*   **Conditional Rendering**: Components like `MobileStepUI` heavily rely on conditional rendering (`activeTab.coupons`, `activeTab.login || activeTab.payments`, `isUpsellCall`) to display different UI sections.

## 16:35:47
The `Dockerfile` for the `mint-dashboard` project shows a consistent setup for a Node.js 20 Alpine application. This includes setting the working directory to `/app`, installing `openssl`, copying `package.json` files, installing dependencies, copying application source, generating the Prisma schema, building the application, exposing port 3000, and finally starting the application.
*   **Significant Change**: On 29/10/2025, 23:35:21, the `npm install` command in the `Dockerfile` was updated from `npm install -f` to `npm install`, removing the force flag. Earlier entries on 28/10/2025 show identical content, suggesting minor saves or non-functional updates.

The `app/api/sendemail/route.ts` file is a Next.js API route ("use server") responsible for handling email reports.
*   It imports `nodemailer` for email functionality, `date-fns` for date formatting, `node-cron` for scheduling (though cron tasks are commented out), and backend functions for managing PNG report data.
*   The `POST` endpoint saves base64 image data for daily or weekly reports to a database.
*   Functions `sendDailyReport` and `sendWeeklyReport` retrieve relevant report data, format dates, and trigger the email sending process. `sendDailyReport` also includes logic to delete `pngReportData` after a successful send.
*   The core `sendEmailForReport` function configures `nodemailer` to send an HTML email with an embedded base64 PNG image to a recipient specified by an environment variable.
*   A `GET` endpoint is present, which currently triggers `sendDailyReport()` and returns a status message, likely for manual testing or external triggering of daily reports.
*   **Significant Changes**:
    *   On 03/11/2025, 17:39:41, the `from` email address in the `sendEmailForReport` function was changed from `integration-noreply@gokwik.co` to `integration-noreply@gokwik.in`.
    *   On 03/11/2025, 18:12:32, logging was added within the `sendEmailForReport` function to `console.log` the response from `transporter.sendMail()`, allowing for better debugging of email sending.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements**:
*   The project uses Node.js 20 and `npm` for dependency management and build processes.
*   Prisma is integrated for database schema generation.
*   Email functionality relies on `nodemailer` and incorporates `date-fns` for consistent date formatting.
*   The email sending mechanism is designed to embed base64 encoded PNG images directly into reports.
*   There's a strong reliance on environment variables for sensitive configurations, particularly for email host, port, and SMTP authentication, which are externalized.
*   The presence of commented-out `node-cron` schedules suggests an intention for automated daily/weekly report distribution, which might be handled externally or via the manual `GET` endpoint trigger.
*   The folder structure indicates a Next.js application (`app/api/` route).

## 16:36:11

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **Upsell Feature Implementation:** A predominant theme is the comprehensive development of an upsell feature, spanning UI components, Redux state management, and new API endpoints. This feature allows for customizable upsell rules, product selection, and discount application.
*   **UI Component Usage:** Consistent utilization of `gokwik-ui-kit` components across different pages (`Row`, `Col`, `Button`, `Input`, `Card`, `Form`, `Checkbox`, `Radio`, `Switch`, `Tooltip`, `Modal`, `Dropdown`, `InputNumber`, `Select`, `TextArea`). This indicates a standardized design system.
*   **State Management with Redux:** `react-redux` is actively used for global state management, particularly for UI customization data (`customizeUiData`) and dispatching updates (`updateUpsellState`).
*   **API Interactions:** A clear pattern of making API calls (`makeAPICall`) for data fetching, creation, updating, and deletion is observed, with new endpoints being introduced as features expand.
*   **Navigation and User Experience:** The use of `updateBreadcrumbs` across multiple pages ensures a consistent navigation hierarchy. Tooltips (`Tooltip` with `QuestionCircleOutlined` or `InfoCircleOutlined`) are frequently added to provide contextual help for various form fields.
*   **Code Structure and Organization:** Separation of concerns is evident with distinct files for UI components (`mobilePage.tsx`, `upsellCheckout.tsx`, `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, `productSearch.tsx`, `formRender.tsx`), Redux store (`customize-ui/index.ts`), API definitions (`apiEndpoints.ts`), and API calls (`api.ts`).
*   **Debugging and Minor Refinements:** Numerous timestamps show minor code changes (e.g., `console.log` adjustments, slight reformatting), indicating an iterative development process involving frequent saves and small corrections.
*   **Dynamic UI Elements:** Components often use `Form.useWatch` to dynamically control the visibility and behavior of other form fields based on user input (e.g., `hidden` or `required` props).
*   **Placeholder Images:** Consistent use of `ShopifyProductPlaceholderImage` and `ShopifyCollectionPlaceholderImage` for displaying default visuals.

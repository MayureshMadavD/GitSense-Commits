# Activity Summary for 07/11/2025

## 00:49:16
The changes across these files primarily focus on UI customization, upsell rule management, and abandoned cart editing within a checkout dashboard application.

### File-Specific Updates:

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 05/11/2025, 23:43:57 and 05/11/2025, 23:47:31
        *   Minor changes, possibly formatting or whitespace, between these two timestamps. The actual code appears largely identical.
    *   **Timestamp:** 05/11/2025, 23:46:41 and 05/11/2025, 23:47:02
        *   The `ref` variable's type declaration was updated from `useRef(selectedValue)` to `useRef<HTMLDivElement | null>(null)`. This change provides a more explicit type for the ref and initializes it to `null`, which is a common pattern for DOM element refs. The `textCount` state initialization also changed from `ref?.current || ''` to the same, reflecting this ref type change. This suggests a refinement in how the RichTextEditor interacts with its DOM element.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 05/11/2025, 23:44:28 and 05/11/2025, 23:45:00
        *   The initialization of `selectedValue` for the `RichTextEditor` component was updated. It now explicitly checks if `upsellRules?.[index]?.title` exists, and if not, it defaults to the placeholder text `'Enter Text To Update'`. This improves the user experience by providing a clear prompt when no title is present.
    *   **Timestamp:** 05/11/2025, 23:45:00 and 05/11/2025, 23:47:43
        *   No significant code changes were observed between these two timestamps, suggesting minor edits like whitespace or re-saves.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 09:59:44 and 06/11/2025, 11:22:01
        *   In the `isLocal` environment configuration, the URL for `@gokwik/utilities` was changed from `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js` to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in/utilities/gokwik-utilities.js`. This indicates a shift in the local development environment to fetch utilities from the sandbox dashboard instead of QA.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 10:04:25 to 06/11/2025, 16:13:17
        *   Across these multiple timestamps, the only observable change is the addition of two new state properties in the `state` object: `abcUrl: null` and `isCheckoutLink: false`. This suggests the introduction of functionality related to abandoned cart URLs or checkout links, possibly for generating or tracking them. Other timestamps within this range show identical code, implying frequent saving without substantial changes.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 23:24:11 to 06/11/2025, 23:34:43
        *   No significant code changes were observed in this file across these timestamps. This indicates routine saving or minor, unrecorded changes.
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 23:44:38 and 06/11/2025, 23:53:46
        *   A `products` array was introduced, containing sample product data with `id`, `product_id`, `product_name`, `product_thumbnail_url`, `totalVariants`, `variants`, and `minPrice`. This array appears to be for demonstration or testing purposes within the `MobileStepUI` component. The `console.log(customizeUiData?.upsell_data)` was also added.
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 23:53:46 to 07/11/2025, 00:29:43
        *   No significant code changes were observed in this file across these numerous timestamps, suggesting frequent saves or minor, unrecorded edits. The `console.log(customizeUiData?.upsell_data)` line remains.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/upsellCheckout/index.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 06/11/2025, 23:37:58
        *   This file was introduced or updated, importing `MobileStepUI` and `UpsellForCheckout`. It sets up a layout with two columns, one for `UpsellForCheckout` and the other for `MobileStepUI` with specific `tabs`, `couponsData`, and `checkoutElementData` props (all initialized to `[]` for `MobileStepUI`). This suggests integration of the upsell configuration alongside a mobile UI preview.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/customize-ui/index.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 07/11/2025, 00:36:29 and 07/11/2025, 00:40:49
        *   A new property, `is_upsell_enabled: false`, was added to the `upsell_data` object in the initial state. This indicates the introduction of a feature toggle for the upsell functionality.

*   **`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp:** 07/11/2025, 00:42:32
        *   This file shows significant updates related to upsell rule management.
        *   It now integrates `updateUpsellState` from Redux to dispatch the `is_upsell_enabled` status based on `config?.cart_upsell?.enabled` with a debounce.
        *   The `buildUpsellCollapse` function now displays an "Alert" message for each rule (e.g., "Rule 1"), making it easier to identify rules.
        *   The `handleFormSubmit` function was enhanced to remove specific keys (`discounted_price`, `products`, `rule_applicable_on`, `rule_applicable_on_products`, `upsell_product_list`) before pushing upsell data, implying a cleanup or transformation of data sent to the API. It also includes validation via `validateUpsellRules`.

### Patterns and Recurring Elements:

*   **UI Customization Focus:** Several files (`richtexteditor.tsx`, `upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, `mobilePage.tsx`) are consistently updated, indicating an ongoing effort to refine the user interface and customization options within the checkout dashboard.
*   **Upsell Feature Development:** A strong recurring theme is the development and refinement of upsell features, including their UI configuration (`customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`, `upsell/upsellFormRenderer.tsx`, `upsell/upsellCheckout.tsx`) and underlying state management (`store/customize-ui/index.ts`).
*   **Frontend Technologies:** The use of React, Redux, and Ant Design components (`gokwik-ui-kit` which likely wraps Ant Design) is consistent across the UI-related files.
*   **API Interaction:** The `editAbcCart.tsx` file shows a pattern of interacting with a backend API for fetching and creating customer, address, and abandoned cart data.
*   **Environment Configuration:** The `.env` and `index.ejs` files are periodically updated to reflect changes in API base URLs and import map configurations, typically for switching between `dev`, `qa`, and `sandbox` environments.
*   **Detailed Timestamps:** The timestamps are highly specific, often within seconds or a few minutes of each other, especially for `.tsx` files. This could indicate rapid iterative development, frequent saves, or automated tooling.
*   **Refinement of State Management:** There's a clear pattern of refining state management for UI components, such as making ref types more explicit in `richtexteditor.tsx` or introducing an `is_upsell_enabled` flag in the Redux store for upsell functionality.
*   **Preview Functionality:** The `mobilePage.tsx` component is consistently updated to accurately reflect changes in UI customization, indicating a dedicated preview mode for various checkout steps (brand, login, payments, address, coupons).

The log entries primarily demonstrate active development on frontend features, particularly around UI customization for checkout and upsell flows, with regular updates to API configurations and Redux state structures to support these features.

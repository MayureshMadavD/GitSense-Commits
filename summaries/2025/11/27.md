# Activity Summary for 27/11/2025

## 11:23:44
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp of Significant Change:** `22/11/2025, 17:39:07`
    *   The `makeAPICall` asynchronous function, responsible for handling all API interactions including file uploads and general requests, was updated.
    *   Specifically, the error handling within the `catch` block for HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses was refined. Previously, upon a 401 error, the function returned the entire error object spread into a new object `{ ...error, error: true }`.
    *   The update changed this to return a more standardized and cleaner error object: `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This ensures that only a boolean `error` flag and a specific `message` (derived from the API response data or the generic error message) are returned, rather than potentially exposing the full Axios error object.
    *   No functional code changes were observed between the timestamp `22/11/2025, 17:39:07` and `22/11/2025, 17:39:40`. The latter entry appears to be a save operation without further modifications.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes focus on the `common.ts` file, indicating a concentrated effort on refining shared utility functions for the dashboard UI.
*   The primary function undergoing modification is `makeAPICall`, which is a central utility for API requests, including security headers, loader management, and error handling.
*   The change specifically targets error handling for unauthorized API calls (HTTP 401), suggesting a focus on improving the robustness and consistency of security-related error responses across the application.
*   The `logUserEvent` function and its associated `getFixedParams` and `parseUserAgent` helper functions, which are responsible for user event tracking and analytics, remain unchanged across the logged entries.

## 11:40:18
The log details changes across several files within an `appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update` directory, all occurring on 26/11/2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/src/initApp.js`**
    *   At **16:00:52**, this file was updated to include an import for `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwik-pass-v2`, in addition to existing `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` and `@appmaker-xyz/shopify-core-theme` imports. This indicates the integration of a new Kwik Pass extension.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/package.json`**
    *   **16:16:43**: This timestamp captures the initial state of the `package.json`, listing numerous dependencies related to Expo, React Native, Firebase, and various `@appmaker-xyz` packages, many with versions ending in `-expo-v2-53-starter-app-25-11-23aa850.0`.
    *   **18:09:35**: Several `@appmaker-xyz` dependencies (e.g., `core`, `react-native`, `remote-bundle`, `shopify`, `shopify-core-theme`, `ui`, `uikit`) were updated to versions ending in `-expo-v2-53-supertails-app-working-reactotron-25-09-ac86605.0`. Additionally, `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` was updated from `0.2.87` to `0.2.88-3259-expo-locator-is-not-working-in-ios-vaaree-24-07-fe54d0d.0`.
    *   **18:10:04** and **18:13:19**: The dependency versions for the `@appmaker-xyz` packages listed above were reverted to their previous state, specifically back to versions ending in `-expo-v2-53-starter-app-25-11-23aa850.0` and `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` returning to `0.2.87`. This suggests a brief, reverted experiment or correction in package versions.
    *   **18:17:43**: A significant number of new dependencies were added, indicating an expansion of the application's capabilities. These include:
        *   `@react-native-firebase/installations`
        *   `@snowplow/react-native-tracker` (for analytics)
        *   `expo-localization`
        *   `react-native-device-info`

        *   `@sparkfabrik/react-native-idfa-aaid` (for advertising identifiers)
        *   `react-native-get-random-values`
        *   Additionally, `react-native-element-dropdown` was updated from version `^1.8.12` to `^2.9.0`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes happened on **26/11/2025**.
*   The `package.json` file saw frequent modifications, especially related to the versioning of `@appmaker-xyz` packages. These packages consistently use a detailed version string format that includes `expo-v2-53` along with specific build identifiers and dates, indicating a structured release or development process.
*   There's a pattern of integrating multiple extensions and external libraries, particularly around authentication (Kwikpass, OTP), analytics (Snowplow, Firebase installations, IDFA/AAID), and device-specific functionalities (localization, device info). This suggests ongoing development to enhance features and potentially gather more user/device data.
*   The brief version change and immediate reversion for `@appmaker-xyz` packages in `package.json` within a minute suggests a testing or rollback action.

## 11:41:11
The log details a series of code changes focused on dashboard UI development, specifically around shipping settings and discount validations, with some updates to API endpoints and deployment configurations.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx** (24/11/2025, 12:36:01): This new React component, `ShippingMethodConfig`, was introduced. It's a comprehensive interface for configuring shipping methods based on price, customer segments, and pincodes. It includes extensive UI elements from `gokwik-ui-kit`, state management for form inputs, modals, and file uploads. Key functionalities include fetching customer segments, uploading cohort CSVs to S3 via presigned URLs, downloading CSVs, and fetching pincode lists. Form fields are defined with validation rules covering required fields, numeric input, unique shipping names, and non-zero prices.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts** (Numerous updates from 24/11/2025, 12:45:40 to 24/11/2025, 17:34:51): This file consistently defines and refines validation functions for various discount types, including `validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, `validateBuyXatYDiscount`, `validateDiscountCapping`, and `validateGWP`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 12:45:40**: Introduced a new check `differentFreebieForSameRange` within `validateTieredDiscount` to prevent conflicting freebie products for overlapping tiers.
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:16:08**: The `Weight_based_Shipping_Rates` interface was imported, and a new `validateWeightRangeDifference` function was exported (though its full implementation is not shown in the log snippets). Most other updates to this file are identical, indicating frequent saves without functional changes.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx** (Numerous updates from 24/11/2025, 15:16:01 to 24/11/2025, 20:19:36): This new React component, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, was introduced for managing shipping rates based on weight.
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:16:01**: Initial implementation including form fields for shipping name, ID, min/max weight, and price. It uses `validateWeightRangeDifference` for validation. The component also features a sortable table with filtering options based on Shipping ID.
    *   **24/11/2025, 15:23:28** and **24/11/2025, 15:27:43**: Minor adjustments to how arguments are passed to `validateWeightRangeDifference`, specifically regarding the `isEditEnabled` flag.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:40:20**: A `console.log(weightConfig)` statement was temporarily added in a debugging step.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:49:44**: The `console.log` statement was removed.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:57:57**: The first argument to `validateWeightRangeDifference` was changed from `weightConfig` to `weightConfig?.weight_based_shipping_rates`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:07:59**: The weight range validation logic was temporarily refactored to make two separate calls for `min_weight` and `max_weight` against `validateWeightRangeDifference`, with an adjusted error message check. The first argument reverted to `weightConfig`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:16:36**: This refactoring was reverted, consolidating validation back to a single `validateWeightRangeDifference` call.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:20:50**: The two-call validation approach for `min_weight` and `max_weight` was reintroduced.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:24:39**: This was again reverted to a single validation call. The frequent changes suggest active development and iteration on the validation logic for weight ranges.
    *   **24/11/2025, 17:36:11**: An update was made to the `useEffect` hook to prevent `weight_based_shipping_rates` from being unintentionally cleared if the `weightConfigs` prop is an empty array.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:15:07**: A debugging `console.log` was again temporarily added.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:19:27**: The debugging `console.log` was removed.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs** (Updates on 24/11/2025, 16:50:58, 16:52:06, 16:53:39): This EJS template file, responsible for client-side module loading, saw updates to its `systemjs-importmap` configuration.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:50:58**: `@gokwik/kwikcomm` was added to the import map for `dev` and `qa` environments.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:52:06**: In the `isLocal` environment, the URLs for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` were updated from `dev-dashboard` to `qa-dashboard`.
    *   **24/11/2025, 16:53:39**: In the `isLocal` environment, the URLs for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` were updated from `qa-dashboard` to `sandbox-dashboard`. These changes reflect shifts in local development dependencies.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx** (Updates on 24/11/2025, 20:17:43, 20:29:59, 25/11/2025, 13:00:14, 26/11/2025, 12:35:55): This new component, `ShippingService`, serves as the main entry point for shipping settings, managing a tabbed interface.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:17:43**: Initial creation, integrating `ShippingMethodConfig`, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, and `DiscountBaseShipping` into tabs. It includes logic for saving configurations and refetching data upon tab changes.
    *   **24/11/2025, 20:29:59**: A new tab for "Product Based Shipping" (`key: '2'`) was introduced and conditionally rendered. This caused the "Weight Based Shipping" tab to shift to `key: '3'` and "Discount Based Shipping" to `key: '4'`, and the `handleTabChange` logic was updated accordingly.
    *   **25/11/2025, 13:00:14**: The `destroyInactiveTabPane` prop was added to the `Tabs` component, likely for performance or state management.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx** (25/11/2025, 12:58:37): A new generic React component, `ProductSearch`, was implemented. It provides a reusable modal-based search functionality for either products or collections, supporting features like infinite scroll, debounced search, filtering by tags, quantity management (including for "top-up gifts" and collection-specific rules), and displaying product variants.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts** (Updates on 25/11/2025, 12:59:31 and 26/11/2025, 12:35:45): This file, containing API endpoint definitions, was expanded.
    *   **25/11/2025, 12:59:31**: New endpoints `getVariantById`, `getCollectionById`, and `getProductById` were added to retrieve detailed product and collection information.
    *   **26/11/2025, 12:35:45**: A new nested object `upsellCheckout` was introduced, defining `getandDeleteUpsellData` and `updateUpsellData` for managing upsell configurations.

*   **/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts** (Updates on 25/11/2025, 12:59:47 and 26/11/2025, 12:35:28): This file provides utility functions for making API calls.
    *   **25/11/2025, 12:59:47**: `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts` was updated to utilize the newly added API endpoints for product and collection searches, including logic for filtering active products and restructuring variant data. A new `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was added to fetch detailed information for multiple variants or collections.
    *   **26/11/2025, 12:35:28**: Two new API utility functions, `getAndDeleteUpsellData` and `pushUpsellData`, were added to interact with the new upsell API endpoints.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   **24/11/2025, 12:36:01**: Initial creation of `shippingBasedMethods.tsx`, marking the start of detailed shipping method configuration UI.
*   **24/11/2025, 12:45:40**: `validations.ts` received its first update, adding `differentFreebieForSameRange` to tiered discount validation.
*   **24/11/2025, 15:16:01**: Initial creation of `weightShipping.tsx`, introducing weight-based shipping configuration.
*   **24/11/2025, 15:16:08**: `validations.ts` imported `Weight_based_Shipping_Rates` and started exporting `validateWeightRangeDifference`, signaling integration with weight-based shipping.
*   **24/11/2025, 16:50:58**: `index.ejs` was updated to include `@gokwik/kwikcomm` for `dev` and `qa` environments, indicating deployment configuration changes.
*   **24/11/2025, 20:17:43**: Initial creation of `shippingBasedService.tsx`, centralizing shipping configuration into a tabbed interface.
*   **24/11/2025, 20:29:59**: `shippingBasedService.tsx` was updated to introduce a "Product Based Shipping" tab, changing the structure of the shipping settings.
*   **25/11/2025, 12:58:37**: Initial creation of `productSearch.tsx`, a versatile component for searching products/collections.
*   **25/11/2025, 12:59:31**: `apiEndpoints.ts` added new endpoints for detailed product/collection retrieval.
*   **25/11/2025, 12:59:47**: `api.ts` integrated new product/collection search capabilities.
*   **26/11/2025, 12:35:28**: `api.ts` added new utility functions for upsell data management.
*   **26/11/2025, 12:35:45**: `apiEndpoints.ts` defined new endpoints for upsell features.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   **Component-based Development**: New features like shipping methods, weight-based shipping, and product search are implemented as distinct React components (`ShippingMethodConfig`, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, `ProductSearch`).
*   **Centralized API Management**: `apiEndpoints.ts` and `api.ts` serve as central locations for defining API routes and creating utility functions for API calls, respectively. This promotes reusability and maintainability.
*   **Extensive Form and Table Usage**: Both `ShippingMethodConfig` and `WeightBaseShippingMethods` heavily utilize `Form` and `Table` components from `gokwik-ui-kit`, along with various input types and validation rules.
*   **Validation Logic**: A dedicated `validations.ts` file houses numerous validation functions (`validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, `validateWeightRangeDifference`, etc.) for ensuring data integrity across different features. The `rangesOverlap` function is a common utility for range-based validations. There's a notable pattern of frequent saves to `validations.ts` without apparent functional changes, indicating either meticulous saving or a tool-driven save behavior.
*   **State Management**: `useState` and `useEffect` hooks are extensively used for managing component-level state and side effects, particularly for form data, modal visibility, and data fetching/updating. Redux (`useAppDispatch`, `useSelector`) is used for global state.
*   **Modularity**: Shipping configurations are broken down into sub-components (`shippingBasedMethods`, `weightShipping`, `discountShipping`, `productBasaedShipping`) orchestrated by `ShippingService`, demonstrating a modular approach.
*   **Environment Configuration**: The `index.ejs` file shows dynamic loading of micro-frontends (e.g., `@gokwik/utilities`, `@gokwik/dashboard`) based on the `deployedEnv` (local, dev, qa, sandbox), reflecting a multi-environment deployment strategy. Changes here indicate switching local development environments.
*   **Debugging Practices**: Temporary `console.log` statements (`weightShipping.tsx` at 16:40:20 and 20:15:07) suggest active debugging during development.
*   **Feature Expansion**: The log shows a clear progression of adding new features: price-based shipping, then weight-based, then a "Product Based Shipping" tab, and new API calls for upsell functionality, indicating continuous development and expansion of the dashboard's capabilities.

## 12:23:43
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`**
    *   The primary change occurred around **22/11/2025, 17:39:07**.
    *   Within the `makeAPICall` asynchronous function, in the `catch` block that specifically handles `401` (unauthorized) HTTP status codes, the error return mechanism was refined.
    *   **Before 17:39:07**, if an unauthorized error occurred, the function would return an object like `{ ...error, error: true }`.
    *   **At 17:39:07 (and subsequently at 17:39:40)**, this return was updated to `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This modification ensures that a more descriptive error message is explicitly provided, preferring a message from the API response (`error?.response?.data?.message`) if available, otherwise falling back to the generic `error.message`.
    *   Aside from this specific error handling improvement, the overall structure and other functionalities within `makeAPICall` (e.g., handling internal users, file uploads, loader events, navigation on 401) and `logUserEvent` (e.g., user agent parsing, fixed parameters) remained consistent across all logged timestamps.

**Timestamps of Significant Changes:**

*   The most significant functional change observed occurred at **22/11/2025, 17:39:07**. The preceding entry at 17:38:55 shows the code before this specific alteration, and the subsequent entry at 17:39:40 shows the code maintaining this change.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   All logged changes are minor refinements to error handling within a critical `makeAPICall` function, specifically around how 401 unauthorized errors are communicated back to the caller.
*   The code consistently uses Axios for API calls, includes robust error handling with navigation for unauthorized users, manages loading states (`loaderEvent`), and integrates with dashboard-specific utilities for user data and cookies.
*   There's also a `logUserEvent` function which gathers extensive user and device information, indicating a focus on analytics and user tracking.

## 12:40:19
The provided log details changes within an `appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update` project.

**File-Specific Updates:**

        *   AppMaker Extension: `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package`
        *   An existing dependency, `react-native-element-dropdown`, was updated from `^1.8.12` to `^2.9.0`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **AppMaker Ecosystem Development**: The project path and extensive use of `@appmaker-xyz` and `@appmaker-packages` dependencies confirm this is an AppMaker SDK project.
*   **Expo 53 Focus**: The project name and `expo` dependency (`^53.0.0`) indicate a specific focus on compatibility with Expo SDK 53.
*   **Detailed Versioning**: Many `@appmaker-xyz` dependencies utilize highly specific version strings that include build information and dates (e.g., `-expo-v2-53-starter-app-25-11-23aa850.0`), suggesting a tightly controlled internal release process.
*   **Rapid Iteration**: The multiple updates and a reversion to `package.json` within a few hours (between 16:16 and 18:17) point to active development, testing, and dependency adjustments.
*   **Integration of External Services**: The consistent presence of `@react-native-firebase` packages and the addition of `@snowplow/react-native-tracker` and IDFA/AAID packages suggest a focus on analytics, user authentication, and potentially crash reporting or remote configuration.
*   **Kwikpass Extension**: The inclusion of `extension-kwik-pass-v2` in `initApp.js` and `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package` in `package.json` indicates an integration with Kwikpass functionality.

## 13:23:45
The primary file updated in the provided log is `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

The significant change occurred between the timestamps 22/11/2025, 17:38:55 and 22/11/2025, 17:39:07. The entry at 17:39:40 shows no further modifications from the 17:39:07 version.

Specifically, the `makeAPICall` asynchronous function was updated. Within its `catch` block, the error handling for `401 Unauthorized` responses was modified:

*   **Before (17:38:55):** When an unauthorized error occurred, the function returned the error object with an `error: true` flag using a spread operator: `return { ...error, error: true }`.
*   **After (17:39:07):** This was refined to explicitly return `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This change ensures a consistent structure for error responses, prioritizing a specific message from the API response data, if available, or falling back to the generic error message.

Other parts of the file, including the `APIRequestConfig` interface, `internalUserPostUrls` array, the file upload logic within `makeAPICall`, and the `logUserEvent` function (with its associated `getFixedParams` and `parseUserAgent` helpers), remained unchanged across these timestamps.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   The `common.ts` file acts as a central utility for common application functionalities, including making API calls and logging user events.
*   There's a clear emphasis on robust API interaction, handling various HTTP methods, file uploads, and integrating with UI feedback mechanisms like loaders (`loaderEvent`) and timers (`timerEvent`).
*   Security and user experience considerations are evident in the `makeAPICall` function's headers (e.g., `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Referrer-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy`), handling of internal user permissions, and comprehensive error handling for 401 status codes, which includes clearing user tokens and redirecting to the login page, with specific exclusions for authentication-related routes.
*   The `logUserEvent` function demonstrates detailed user session and device data collection, parsing user agent strings to extract OS, device, browser, and version information, along with generating unique session IDs using `nanoid` and cookies for tracking.
*   Environment variables (`process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL`, `process.env.NODE_ENV`) are utilized for configuration, allowing for different behaviors based on the deployment environment.

    *   **Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 16:00:52**
    *   This file was updated to include core Appmaker imports: `@appmaker-xyz/plugins`, `@appmaker-xyz/shopify-core-theme`, and a specific extension, `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwik-pass-v2`. This indicates the initial setup or activation of these components for the application.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/package.json`**
    *   **Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 16:16:43**
        *   The `package.json` file shows numerous dependencies, with many `@appmaker-xyz` packages using version strings like `0.X.Y-expo-v2-53-starter-app-25-11-23aa850.0`. It includes `@appmaker-xyz/parser` at `0.1.0` and `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` at `0.2.87`. The project is configured for Expo SDK 53.
    *   **Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 18:09:35**
        *   Several `@appmaker-xyz` dependencies had their versions updated to a different specific build, indicated by `0.X.Y-expo-v2-53-supertails-app-working-reactotron-25-09-ac86605.0`. Notably, `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` was updated to `0.2.88-3259-expo-locator-is-not-working-in-ios-vaaree-24-07-fe54d0d.0`, and `@appmaker-xyz/parser` was removed from the dependencies.
    *   **Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 18:10:04**
        *   This entry shows a quick reversion of the changes made in the previous commit. All `@appmaker-xyz` dependencies were reverted back to their `starter-app` build versions (e.g., `0.X.Y-expo-v2-53-starter-app-25-11-23aa850.0`), `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` returned to `0.2.87`, and `@appmaker-xyz/parser` was re-added at `0.1.0`.
    *   **Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 18:13:19**
        *   No observable changes were made in this entry compared to the previous one at 18:10:04, suggesting a save without modifications or a re-listing of content.
    *   **Timestamp: 26/11/2025, 18:17:43**
        *   A significant update occurred, adding several new dependencies: `@react-native-firebase/installations`, `@snowplow/react-native-tracker`, `expo-localization`, `react-native-device-info`, `react-native-otp-entry`, `react-native-quick-base64`, `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package`, `@sparkfabrik/react-native-idfa-aaid`, and `react-native-get-random-values`. Additionally, `react-native-element-dropdown` was updated from `^1.8.12` to `^2.9.0`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Appmaker Custom Builds:** A strong pattern is the use of highly specific, internal Appmaker package versions (e.g., `-expo-v2-53-starter-app-...` or `-expo-v2-53-supertails-app-...`). This indicates a development environment tailored to Appmaker's ecosystem, possibly managing multiple client or feature branches.
*   **Expo 53 Migration Context:** The file path and the `expo` dependency version `^53.0.0` confirm that these changes are part of an update or maintenance process for an application running on Expo SDK 53.
*   **Dependency Volatility:** The `package.json` experienced rapid changes and immediate reversions of `@appmaker-xyz` package versions and the inclusion/exclusion of `@appmaker-xyz/parser` within a short timeframe (between 18:09:35 and 18:10:04). This suggests active testing, branch switching, or quick rollback procedures during development.
*   **Focus on Mobile Analytics and User Features:** The additions in the final `package.json` update point to an expansion of features related to user engagement, analytics, and device capabilities, including Firebase installations, Snowplow tracking, localization, device information, and OTP verification.
*   **Kwik Pass Integration:** The repeated appearance of "Kwik Pass" related packages (initially `extension-kwik-pass-v2` in `initApp.js`, and later `extension-kwikpass-expo-package` in `package.json`) highlights an ongoing or new integration with this specific system.

## 13:41:42
The changes span from November 24, 2025, to November 27, 2025, focusing on validation logic, shipping settings, product/collection search, and API endpoint management within a checkout dashboard UI.

**File-Specific Updates:**

1.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/validations.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp**: Multiple entries from 24/11/2025, 12:45:40 to 24/11/2025, 17:34:51.
    *   **Key Changes**: Across all entries in the log, the content of this file remains identical. It exports several validation functions (`validateTieredDiscount`, `validateDynamicDiscount`, `validateBuyXatYDiscount`, `validateDiscountCapping`, `validateGWP`) which implement comprehensive business logic checks for various discount types and configurations, including range overlaps, uniqueness of codes, minimum/maximum value constraints, and freebie product requirements. The consistency suggests the logged entries might be snapshots of the same file state or that no functional changes were made to this specific file during the logged period.

2.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/weightShipping.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 24/11/2025, 15:16:01 to 24/11/2025, 20:19:36.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **24/11/2025, 15:23:28**: The `validateWeightRangeDifference` function call in `getValesFromForm` was updated to pass an additional `isEditEnabled` boolean parameter, changing its signature from 4 to 5 arguments.
        *   **24/11/2025, 15:27:43**: The `isEditEnabled` parameter passed to `validateWeightRangeDifference` was hardcoded to `false`.
        *   **24/11/2025, 20:15:07**: A `console.log(weightConfigs,"===")` statement was added within the `useEffect` hook that manages `weightConfig` state.
        *   **24/11/2025, 20:19:27**: The `console.log` was removed, and the `setWeightConfig` logic in the `useEffect` was refined to conditionally update `weight_based_shipping_rates` only if `weightConfigs` has elements, otherwise retaining the existing state.

3.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 24/11/2025, 16:50:58 to 24/11/2025, 16:53:39.
    *   **Key Changes**: The `isLocal` environment configuration for SystemJS import maps was repeatedly modified. The URLs for `@gokwik/utilities` and `@gokwik/dashboard` dependencies were changed from `https://dev-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` (16:50:58) to `https://qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` (16:52:06), and then to `https://sandbox-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` (16:53:39).

4.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shippingBasedService.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 24/11/2025, 20:17:43 to 26/11/2025, 12:35:55.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **24/11/2025, 20:29:59**: A new import `ProductBasedShipping` was added. The tabs structure was refactored to introduce a new "Product Based Shipping" tab (key '2') conditionally, pushing "Weight Based Shipping" to key '3' and "Discount Based Shipping" to key '4'. Corresponding updates were made to the `handleTabChange` switch statement to reflect these new keys.
        *   **25/11/2025, 13:00:14**: The `<Tabs>` component gained the `destroyInactiveTabPane` prop, likely for performance optimization when switching tabs.

5.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 25/11/2025, 12:58:37.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   Introduced `isAgentLed` and `collectionSpecificData` as new props to the `ProductSearch` component, enabling agent-specific product filtering (excluding products tagged 'no-agent') and advanced quantity management for collections.
        *   Added `isEditingSpecificCollection` state and functions (`handleQuantityChange`, `handleCloseAllInput`) to support collection-specific quantity editing and validation.
        *   Enhanced the product search logic to filter active products and handle variants more robustly.

6.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/constants/apiEndpoints.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 25/11/2025, 12:59:31 to 26/11/2025, 12:35:45.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **26/11/2025, 12:35:45**: Added new API endpoints for upsell functionality (`upsellCheckout` with `getandDeleteUpsellData` and `updateUpsellData`) and a general `getProductById` endpoint.

7.  **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/api.ts`**
    *   **Timestamp**: 25/11/2025, 12:59:47 to 27/11/2025, 11:56:48.
    *   **Key Changes**:
        *   **26/11/2025, 12:35:28**: Introduced two new asynchronous functions: `getAndDeleteUpsellData` (for fetching or deleting cart upsell rules) and `pushUpsellData` (for updating upsell rules).
        *   **27/11/2025, 11:56:48**: The `getVariantNCollectionDetailsbyId` function was significantly enhanced to support fetching details by product ID as well, in addition to variant and collection IDs. The logic for constructing the API payload and mapping the response data was expanded to accommodate this new 'product' type.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   **Consistent Timestamp Format**: All timestamps follow the `DD/MM/YYYY, HH:MM:SS` format.
*   **Minor Adjustments and Debugging**: Frequent small changes like adding/removing `console.log` statements and minor tweaks to function parameters are common, particularly in `weightShipping.tsx`.
*   **API and UI Expansion**: There's a clear pattern of extending dashboard functionality by adding new API endpoints (`apiEndpoints.ts`), implementing corresponding API utility functions (`api.ts`), and updating UI components to consume these new features (e.g., `productSearch.tsx` for agent-led filtering and `shippingBasedService.tsx` for new shipping tabs).
*   **Refactoring and Optimization**: The introduction of `destroyInactiveTabPane` in `shippingBasedService.tsx` indicates an effort towards UI performance optimization.
*   **Environment Configuration**: The `index.ejs` file shows a pattern of switching environment URLs for shared dependencies during local development, possibly for testing against different staging environments.

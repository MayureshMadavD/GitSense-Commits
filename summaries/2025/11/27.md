# Activity Summary for 27/11/2025

## 11:23:44
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp of Significant Change:** `22/11/2025, 17:39:07`
    *   The `makeAPICall` asynchronous function, responsible for handling all API interactions including file uploads and general requests, was updated.
    *   Specifically, the error handling within the `catch` block for HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses was refined. Previously, upon a 401 error, the function returned the entire error object spread into a new object `{ ...error, error: true }`.
    *   The update changed this to return a more standardized and cleaner error object: `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This ensures that only a boolean `error` flag and a specific `message` (derived from the API response data or the generic error message) are returned, rather than potentially exposing the full Axios error object.
    *   No functional code changes were observed between the timestamp `22/11/2025, 17:39:07` and `22/11/2025, 17:39:40`. The latter entry appears to be a save operation without further modifications.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes focus on the `common.ts` file, indicating a concentrated effort on refining shared utility functions for the dashboard UI.
*   The primary function undergoing modification is `makeAPICall`, which is a central utility for API requests, including security headers, loader management, and error handling.
*   The change specifically targets error handling for unauthorized API calls (HTTP 401), suggesting a focus on improving the robustness and consistency of security-related error responses across the application.
*   The `logUserEvent` function and its associated `getFixedParams` and `parseUserAgent` helper functions, which are responsible for user event tracking and analytics, remain unchanged across the logged entries.

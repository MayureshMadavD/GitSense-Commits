# Activity Summary for 27/11/2025

## 11:23:44
The provided log details changes to a single file: `/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/dashboard/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/services/common.ts`**:
    *   **Timestamp of Significant Change:** `22/11/2025, 17:39:07`
    *   The `makeAPICall` asynchronous function, responsible for handling all API interactions including file uploads and general requests, was updated.
    *   Specifically, the error handling within the `catch` block for HTTP 401 Unauthorized responses was refined. Previously, upon a 401 error, the function returned the entire error object spread into a new object `{ ...error, error: true }`.
    *   The update changed this to return a more standardized and cleaner error object: `{ error: true, message: error?.response?.data?.message || error.message }`. This ensures that only a boolean `error` flag and a specific `message` (derived from the API response data or the generic error message) are returned, rather than potentially exposing the full Axios error object.
    *   No functional code changes were observed between the timestamp `22/11/2025, 17:39:07` and `22/11/2025, 17:39:40`. The latter entry appears to be a save operation without further modifications.

**Patterns or Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes focus on the `common.ts` file, indicating a concentrated effort on refining shared utility functions for the dashboard UI.
*   The primary function undergoing modification is `makeAPICall`, which is a central utility for API requests, including security headers, loader management, and error handling.
*   The change specifically targets error handling for unauthorized API calls (HTTP 401), suggesting a focus on improving the robustness and consistency of security-related error responses across the application.
*   The `logUserEvent` function and its associated `getFixedParams` and `parseUserAgent` helper functions, which are responsible for user event tracking and analytics, remain unchanged across the logged entries.

## 11:40:18
The log details changes across several files within an `appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update` directory, all occurring on 26/11/2025.

**File-Specific Updates:**

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/src/initApp.js`**
    *   At **16:00:52**, this file was updated to include an import for `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwik-pass-v2`, in addition to existing `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` and `@appmaker-xyz/shopify-core-theme` imports. This indicates the integration of a new Kwik Pass extension.

*   **`/Users/mayuresh.madav/Documents/sdk/appmaker-starter-app-expo-53-update/package.json`**
    *   **16:16:43**: This timestamp captures the initial state of the `package.json`, listing numerous dependencies related to Expo, React Native, Firebase, and various `@appmaker-xyz` packages, many with versions ending in `-expo-v2-53-starter-app-25-11-23aa850.0`.
    *   **18:09:35**: Several `@appmaker-xyz` dependencies (e.g., `core`, `react-native`, `remote-bundle`, `shopify`, `shopify-core-theme`, `ui`, `uikit`) were updated to versions ending in `-expo-v2-53-supertails-app-working-reactotron-25-09-ac86605.0`. Additionally, `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` was updated from `0.2.87` to `0.2.88-3259-expo-locator-is-not-working-in-ios-vaaree-24-07-fe54d0d.0`.
    *   **18:10:04** and **18:13:19**: The dependency versions for the `@appmaker-xyz` packages listed above were reverted to their previous state, specifically back to versions ending in `-expo-v2-53-starter-app-25-11-23aa850.0` and `@appmaker-xyz/plugins` returning to `0.2.87`. This suggests a brief, reverted experiment or correction in package versions.
    *   **18:17:43**: A significant number of new dependencies were added, indicating an expansion of the application's capabilities. These include:
        *   `@react-native-firebase/installations`
        *   `@snowplow/react-native-tracker` (for analytics)
        *   `expo-localization`
        *   `react-native-device-info`
        *   `react-native-otp-entry` and `react-native-quick-base64` (likely for authentication/OTP features)
        *   `@appmaker-packages/extension-kwikpass-expo-package` (another Kwikpass extension)
        *   `@sparkfabrik/react-native-idfa-aaid` (for advertising identifiers)
        *   `react-native-get-random-values`
        *   Additionally, `react-native-element-dropdown` was updated from version `^1.8.12` to `^2.9.0`.

**Patterns and Recurring Elements:**

*   All recorded changes happened on **26/11/2025**.
*   The `package.json` file saw frequent modifications, especially related to the versioning of `@appmaker-xyz` packages. These packages consistently use a detailed version string format that includes `expo-v2-53` along with specific build identifiers and dates, indicating a structured release or development process.
*   There's a pattern of integrating multiple extensions and external libraries, particularly around authentication (Kwikpass, OTP), analytics (Snowplow, Firebase installations, IDFA/AAID), and device-specific functionalities (localization, device info). This suggests ongoing development to enhance features and potentially gather more user/device data.
*   The brief version change and immediate reversion for `@appmaker-xyz` packages in `package.json` within a minute suggests a testing or rollback action.

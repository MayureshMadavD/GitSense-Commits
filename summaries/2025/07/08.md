# Activity Summary for 08/07/2025

## 07:56:40
The log shows a series of edits to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentsHeader/PaymentHeaderShipping.svelte` file between 20:31:55 and 21:30:40 on July 7, 2025.  These edits primarily focused on refining the UI for selecting shipping methods.  The initial version had radio buttons that were initially enabled, then disabled, and finally became read-only (`readonly`).  There were also several minor formatting changes within the HTML structure and style section, mostly involving spacing, classes, and the styling of radio buttons.  The most significant change was the alteration of the radio button behavior to make them read-only.  There are no apparent patterns or recurring elements beyond the continual refinement of the shipping method selection display.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file was also modified multiple times during this period (21:31:45 to 21:57:55).  These changes involved extensive modifications to the script section, primarily related to event handling, data fetching, and store management.  The code handles communication with an iframe, likely for a payment gateway. Error handling for empty carts is also implemented.  The component imports many other components and services, suggesting a complex checkout process.  A recurring theme is the management of numerous Svelte stores related to the checkout process.  The final modifications aimed to handle shopify cart information and manage cookies and local storage appropriately.  The consistent updates to this file point to significant work on integrating different parts of the checkout flow, specifically the handling of initial checkout data and cart information.


Finally, a change was made to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/styles/color.scss` file at 20:59:21, adding a comprehensive list of SCSS variables defining various colors used throughout the application. This suggests a centralized approach to styling, improving maintainability.  No further changes were recorded for this file.


## 11:56:46
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` on August 7th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on modifying the `screenOptions` variable within the `AnalyticsHeader` component.

Initially, the `screenOptions` were conditionally rendered based on the `merchantDetails?.m_id` and the presence of 'discount' or 'website' in the URL's search parameters.  Subsequent commits between 11:52:20 and 11:52:37 changed this logic to instead depend on whether the `user_details?.email` includes '@gokwik.co'.  This provides different screen options based on whether the user is an internal GOKWIK employee or not.

Finally, at 11:53:43, the `screenOptions` were further simplified to only include 'Checkout Analytics' unless the user's email contains '@gokwik.co'.  This represents a significant reduction in conditional rendering complexity compared to previous versions.  The rest of the component's code remains consistent across all commits, indicating that only the screen option selection logic was modified.  The modifications were made within a short timeframe, suggesting a rapid iteration on the feature.


## 12:56:54
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/commonFunctions.tsx` between 12:14:30 and 12:21:20.  These changes primarily focus on the `setDiscountTypeOverviewData` function. The modifications involve altering how data is filtered based on `selectedDiscountType` and `selectedDiscountSubType`, specifically adding an `else` block to ensure data is handled correctly when `selectedDiscountType` is 'All'.  Additionally, the `getUniqueOptions` function within `setDiscountTypeOverviewData` is modified, changing the `excludeAll` parameter handling in one instance.  The other changes in this file are minor or unrelated to this primary alteration.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/discountAnalytics.tsx` also underwent several revisions during the same timeframe (12:23:03, 12:27:25, 12:50:49).  A `console.log` statement was added at 12:27:25 to log the `dates` object.  No other significant functional changes are apparent.


On 08/07/2025 at 11:58:23, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` was updated. This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML based on the `isLocal` and `deployedEnv` variables.  The update involves modifying the import map (`systemjs-importmap`) to load different JavaScript modules depending on the environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  A noteworthy change is the inclusion of Clarity.ms and New Relic code in the production environment, conditional on the existence of a `clarityKey` variable. The production environment also includes a significant chunk of Javascript code related to New Relic.  This suggests a shift in how the dashboard loads its components and integrates with analytics services based on the deployment target.

At 12:01:29 on 08/07/2025, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` was updated. This component renders the header section for the analytics dashboard.  The changes focus on enhancing the user interface elements such as date pickers, sales channel selection, and screen selection for analytics. There's also the addition of event logging using `logEvent` function for various user interactions within the header component.  The update introduces more robust filtering and navigation capabilities for the analytics dashboard.

Finally, at 12:55:14 on 08/07/2025,  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` was updated. This component handles the visibility settings for discount codes.  The update adds more detailed form elements for controlling the visibility, including additional conditions such as minimum and maximum price and quantity. The changes improve the customization options for discount code visibility based on various parameters.  A visual representation of the discount code with conditional display is also added.  The component interacts with Redux via `useAppDispatch` and `useSelector` to manage discount summary updates.  A link to external settings page is also provided.  At 12:56:13 on 08/07/2025, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/offers-discount/addEditOffer.tsx` was updated.  This component is a drawer for adding or editing discount offers.  The update simplifies and improves the UI for adding/editing discounts, using a `Switch` for status and cohort-based settings, and validation through `validateOfferDiscount`.

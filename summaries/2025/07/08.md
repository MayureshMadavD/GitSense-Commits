# Activity Summary for 08/07/2025

## 07:56:40
The log shows a series of edits to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentsHeader/PaymentHeaderShipping.svelte` file between 20:31:55 and 21:30:40 on July 7, 2025.  These edits primarily focused on refining the UI for selecting shipping methods.  The initial version had radio buttons that were initially enabled, then disabled, and finally became read-only (`readonly`).  There were also several minor formatting changes within the HTML structure and style section, mostly involving spacing, classes, and the styling of radio buttons.  The most significant change was the alteration of the radio button behavior to make them read-only.  There are no apparent patterns or recurring elements beyond the continual refinement of the shipping method selection display.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` file was also modified multiple times during this period (21:31:45 to 21:57:55).  These changes involved extensive modifications to the script section, primarily related to event handling, data fetching, and store management.  The code handles communication with an iframe, likely for a payment gateway. Error handling for empty carts is also implemented.  The component imports many other components and services, suggesting a complex checkout process.  A recurring theme is the management of numerous Svelte stores related to the checkout process.  The final modifications aimed to handle shopify cart information and manage cookies and local storage appropriately.  The consistent updates to this file point to significant work on integrating different parts of the checkout flow, specifically the handling of initial checkout data and cart information.


Finally, a change was made to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/styles/color.scss` file at 20:59:21, adding a comprehensive list of SCSS variables defining various colors used throughout the application. This suggests a centralized approach to styling, improving maintainability.  No further changes were recorded for this file.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` on August 7th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on modifying the `screenOptions` variable within the `AnalyticsHeader` component.

Initially, the `screenOptions` were conditionally rendered based on the `merchantDetails?.m_id` and the presence of 'discount' or 'website' in the URL's search parameters.  Subsequent commits between 11:52:20 and 11:52:37 changed this logic to instead depend on whether the `user_details?.email` includes '@gokwik.co'.  This provides different screen options based on whether the user is an internal GOKWIK employee or not.

Finally, at 11:53:43, the `screenOptions` were further simplified to only include 'Checkout Analytics' unless the user's email contains '@gokwik.co'.  This represents a significant reduction in conditional rendering complexity compared to previous versions.  The rest of the component's code remains consistent across all commits, indicating that only the screen option selection logic was modified.  The modifications were made within a short timeframe, suggesting a rapid iteration on the feature.

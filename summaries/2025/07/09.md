## 13:46:02
The log shows multiple revisions to three files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory between 09/07/2025, 12:46:49 and 09/07/2025, 13:42:42.  The primary focus of the changes appears to be on enhancing the display and functionality of discount analytics within a React-based dashboard.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/chart.tsx`: This file contains the code for various chart components used to visualize discount data.  The most significant changes involve improvements to the chart's tooltip functionality, particularly for displaying multiple key values simultaneously.  These changes were made between 12:46:49 and 12:47:03. No other changes are observed in this file.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/discountAnalytics.tsx`: This component renders the discount analytics page.  The majority of changes in this file revolve around the presentation of discount data.  Several updates were made to the layout, specifically how different chart and table components are arranged within the `AnalyticsCard` components.  A notable change introduced a second `DiscountBarChart` next to the primary one in the 'Overall Discount Usage Trend' section (between 12:47:32 and 12:49:12).  Later revisions (12:49:12 to 13:41:05) focused on refining the display of the 'Overall Discount Usage Trend' section when data is limited, adding a table visualization alongside the bar chart, and adjusting the layout and styling of the table to improve responsiveness.  A `console.log` statement was added and removed at different timestamps, seemingly for debugging purposes.  A final styling change for the table within the ‘Overall Discount Usage Trend’ section was observed in the last commit at 13:41:05


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts`: This file contains helper functions for the application.  A new function `extractUniqueCKeysForAntColumn` was added (between 13:08:04 and 13:09:59) which seems designed to process and restructure data for use in a table component.  The addition of this function aligns with the changes observed in `discountAnalytics.tsx`, suggesting it is crucial to the enhanced table-based visualizations in the "Overall Discount Usage Trend" section.  No other substantial changes were made to this file after this commit.


## 14:45:55
The log shows updates to three files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory on September 7th, 2025.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` (13:46:45): This component, `AnalyticsHeader`,  was updated.  The changes involve enhancing the user interface for selecting analytics parameters.  Key updates include adding a `Select` component for choosing checkout platforms (`checkoutPlatformKeys`), sales channels (`salesChannelOptions`), and analytics screens (`screenOptions`).  The date range picker (`AnalyticsDateRangePicker`) now logs events (`logEvent`) based on user selection. Conditional rendering based on `config.enhancer_app` and `user_details?.email` is used to tailor the UI elements. The code also includes logic to handle date selection and display options dynamically.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/discountAnalytics.tsx` (13:47:33):  The `DiscountAnalytics` component was modified.  The update primarily focuses on improving the display and interaction of discount analytics data.  It uses several components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (like `AnalyticsCard`, `Table`, `Select`) to present discount data in various formats (tables, charts).  `DownloadIcon` components are used for data export functionality across multiple sections. The code incorporates functions from `@library/components/analytics/commonFunctions` for data manipulation and filtering.  Conditional rendering is used based on data availability and date ranges (`areBothRangesMoreThanOneDay`) for optimizing the user experience.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` (14:24:34): This component, `DiscountVisibility`, handles the visibility settings for discount codes. It uses `react-redux` for state management (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) and `gokwik-ui-kit` components (`Form`, `Radio`, `Input`, etc.) to create a form for configuring discount code visibility.  The component includes validation (`validateDescription`, `validateDiscountVisibility`) to ensure data integrity and uses conditional rendering to show/hide additional options based on user selections.  The update adds a preview section to visualize how the discount will be shown to customers based on their settings, and includes links to external settings.  The `updateSummary` dispatch function suggests updates to a summary section based on form values.


## 15:45:59
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` files between 14:46 and 15:03 on September 7, 2025.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was also updated at 14:53.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`:** This Svelte component underwent several revisions during the logged period.  The core functionality appears to involve handling merchant information, integrating with various analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics), managing cookies and local storage, and interacting with an iFrame for checkout.  Each update to `Merchant.svelte` involved minor modifications, likely bug fixes or incremental feature additions, rather than large-scale restructuring. The changes seem focused on refining the handling of cookies, URL parameters, and analytics data.  The numerous calls to different analytics services suggest a comprehensive analytics implementation.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`:** This file contains the HTML structure for the merchant page and includes JavaScript code to initialize the Gokwik SDK and handle communication with the `Merchant.svelte` component via window.postMessage. The script sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) and includes placeholder data for `window.merchantInfo`.  No significant changes occurred in this file beyond the initial creation at 14:46.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`:** This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The update at 14:53 likely involved adding or modifying the URLs for different environments, possibly to reflect changes in API endpoints or service locations. The extensive conditional logic suggests a sophisticated mechanism for handling multiple environments and ensuring appropriate API calls depending on the deployment settings.


The recurring pattern across all changes is the emphasis on handling various environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production) and robust integration with multiple analytics services.  The use of `window.postMessage` indicates communication between the HTML and the Svelte component.  The frequent updates to `Merchant.svelte` suggest ongoing development and refinement of the checkout UI and its interaction with backend services.


## 17:46:40
On September 7th, 2025, at 16:18:42, the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/styles/global.scss` file was updated.  This commit extensively modifies the file's styling, adding numerous CSS classes for padding (`p-`, `pt-`, `pb-`, `pl-`, `pr-`, `px-`, `py-`), margin (`m-`, `mt-`, `ml-`, `mb-`, `mr-`, `mx-`, `my-`), text (`text-`), font (`font-`), flexbox (`flex-`), gap, border, rounded corners, and other styling attributes.  The changes introduce a consistent use of rem units for spacing and font sizes and define styles for different colors and background colors, referencing variables like `--green2`, `--neutral-200`, `--white`, and `--black`.  Additionally, classes for specific UI elements such as checkboxes (`styled-checkbox`), tags (`green-tag`, `blue-tag`), and icons (`globalImg.cautionIcon`) are included.  There is also responsive design consideration with a media query for max-width 360px.  The update appears to be a comprehensive styling overhaul for the application, establishing a consistent design language and reusable style components.

The most significant changes happened between 12:57 PM and 14:20 PM on August 7, 2025, primarily focusing on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/offers-discount/index.tsx` file, which involves modifications to a React component responsible for managing offers and discounts.  These changes include updates to the UI rendering, especially the table displaying discount codes, the addition of search functionality and improved handling of API calls for fetching and updating discount codes. There were multiple edits to the handling of `additional_details` and its `bullet_points` property, suggesting improvements in data handling and display.  The changes also included modifications to the UI elements for adding, editing, and deleting discounts.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` file underwent substantial changes between 13:00 PM and 13:01 PM on August 7, 2025.  These alterations seem to concentrate on refining the API interaction for discount management, including mapping data from various sources (Shopify, CSV), handling product and collection IDs, and improving the structure of API requests (`requestMapDiscount`).  The `mapProducts` function shows a focus on efficiently comparing and updating product data.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` file was modified between 13:14 PM and 13:16 PM on August 7, 2025. This file contains various helper functions. The changes  appear minor and involved updating the `areBothRangesMoreThanOneDay` function's logic  (changing the comparison from `>` to `>1`).

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/discountAnalytics.tsx` file was modified several times,  primarily between 13:15 PM and 17:28 PM on August 7, 2025, and again on September 7, 2025.  These changes reflect significant improvements in the analytics dashboard for discounts.  The most notable changes are the addition of conditional rendering based on the date range selection and the introduction of a bar chart to display discount usage when the date range is less than two days. The changes also involve updates to the UI elements and  data fetching/filtering logic.  The added `console.log` statements suggest debugging efforts.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/chart.tsx` file was changed between 13:42 PM and 14:20 PM on August 7, 2025. This involved modifications to the `Chart` component, primarily enhancing the custom tooltip functionality for better data presentation within the chart, particularly  when multiple data points are displayed (e.g., for `multiKeyValue`).

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/chartsData.tsx` file saw several changes between 13:45 PM and 15:56 PM on August 7, 2025. These edits mainly focused on defining and refining data structures and filter options used for chart visualizations and table data within the discount analytics section.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx` file had changes between 16:16 PM and 16:27 PM on August 7, 2025. These modifications involve adjusting the rendering of a form component for integration settings, likely including additions and modifications of input fields related to loyalty programs and gift cards.  The changes significantly expanded on the form elements for loyalty program configuration.

In summary, the code changes reflect a concerted effort to enhance the user interface and functionality of the discount management and analytics features within the checkout dashboard UI.  The updates range from UI refinements to substantial improvements in data handling and API interactions. The repeated modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/discountAnalytics.tsx` and its related files suggest iterative development and debugging during the implementation of the discount usage trend visualization improvements.

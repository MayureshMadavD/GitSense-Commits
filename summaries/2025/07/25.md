# Activity Summary for 25/07/2025

## 17:27:28
The log shows modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/.env`.

The `index.ejs` file, updated at 16:33:40 and 16:35:28, is an HTML template configuring a single-spa application.  The key change between these two timestamps involves the URLs used for loading different modules (`@gokwik/*`).  Initially,  a mix of `localhost` and `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` URLs were present for the local and other environments, respectively. In the second update, the `localhost` URLs for `@gokwik/configuration` and `@gokwik/checkout` modules were changed to use the `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` URL for the `isLocal` environment.  The file includes configurations for `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, and `production` environments, each specifying different base URLs for various @gokwik modules. The production environment also includes snippets for Clarity and New Relic tracking.


The `.env` file, updated multiple times (16:33:11, 16:35:38, 16:48:09, and 16:50:09), defines environment variables for `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_BULK_DISCOUNT_URL`.  The changes primarily involve toggling between commented and uncommented lines, suggesting the switching between different environments (dev, qa, sandbox).  The final update at 16:50:09 shows the `dev` environment uncommented while `qa` and `sandbox` are commented out.  The URLs for these variables remain consistent across all updates, only their activation status changes.

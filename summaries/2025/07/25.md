# Activity Summary for 25/07/2025

## 17:27:28
The log shows modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/.env`.

The `index.ejs` file, updated at 16:33:40 and 16:35:28, is an HTML template configuring a single-spa application.  The key change between these two timestamps involves the URLs used for loading different modules (`@gokwik/*`).  Initially,  a mix of `localhost` and `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` URLs were present for the local and other environments, respectively. In the second update, the `localhost` URLs for `@gokwik/configuration` and `@gokwik/checkout` modules were changed to use the `qa-dashboard.dev.gokwik.in` URL for the `isLocal` environment.  The file includes configurations for `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, and `production` environments, each specifying different base URLs for various @gokwik modules. The production environment also includes snippets for Clarity and New Relic tracking.


The `.env` file, updated multiple times (16:33:11, 16:35:38, 16:48:09, and 16:50:09), defines environment variables for `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_BULK_DISCOUNT_URL`.  The changes primarily involve toggling between commented and uncommented lines, suggesting the switching between different environments (dev, qa, sandbox).  The final update at 16:50:09 shows the `dev` environment uncommented while `qa` and `sandbox` are commented out.  The URLs for these variables remain consistent across all updates, only their activation status changes.


## 20:27:27
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` file on July 25, 2025.  There are two entries, both at 20:26, differing only by a few seconds. This suggests that either a very minor change was made, or the commit was attempted twice.

The `freeGift.tsx` file is a React component dealing with settings related to automatic free gifts.  The code defines a form for configuring free gift rules, including:

* **Rule Name:**  An input field for the rule's name.
* **Sales Channels:** A checkbox to select where the free gift applies (App, Web, Agent led).
* **Purchase Requirement:** A radio button to select whether the free gift is based on cart value or quantity.
* **Minimum and Maximum Value/Quantity:**  Input fields for setting thresholds.
* **Gift Applicability:** A radio button to select whether the gift applies to all products, specific products, or specific collections.  Conditional rendering hides product/collection selectors based on this selection.
* **Free Gift Product Selection:** A search component to choose the free gift product.
* **Free Gift Quantity and Price:** Input fields for setting these values.

The component uses `Form.useForm` and `Form.useWatch` from a UI library (`gokwik-ui-kit`) for form management. It also includes functions for adding, editing, deleting and enabling/disabling free gift rules.  The component renders a table displaying configured rules, allowing users to edit and delete them. The code heavily uses nested arrays for accessing form values.  No functional changes are apparent between the two nearly identical commits.

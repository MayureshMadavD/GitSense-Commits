# Activity Summary for 17/07/2025

## 00:31:42
The log shows modifications to React components for a customizable login UI within a checkout dashboard.  The key changes revolve around the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` file and its interaction with `loginPage.tsx`.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx`:**

This file, primarily updated between 17/07/2025, 00:28:44 and 17/07/2025, 00:30:02, shows a React component (`Login`) responsible for rendering the login page settings.  Changes in this file focused on minor adjustments:  removing unnecessary console logs and moving the `setIsChanged` function call into `onValuesChange` for more accurate change tracking within the Form component.  The component uses `useMerchantConfigApi` to fetch and save configuration data.  It provides settings for background color, banner content, consent text, button visibility, and button text, all managed through a form. The `RenderEditorFunction` is used for rendering reusable UI components for banner and consent sections.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/customUiHelperFunction.tsx`:**

This file, updated at 17/07/2025, 00:05:08, defines a reusable function `RenderEditorFunction`. This function's purpose is to render a consistent UI for editing different sections in the login page customization. The update modified the `repsonseText` parameter type to `any` to handle different data types from the `loginPage.tsx`


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx`:**

This file underwent significant changes between 16/07/2025, 23:47:52 and 17/07/2025, 00:23:56. It's a component for rendering and managing multiple banners, implementing drag-and-drop functionality.  The major revisions addressed how the component interacts with the form's state: The initial version used `selectedValue`  incorrectly to fetch the form value, leading to issues.  The updates consistently use `form.getFieldValue(selectedValue)` to correctly retrieve the banner data from the form's state, ensuring proper data synchronization and rendering. The `initializeContent` function also updated to correctly handle initial values from the form state.  A debounce function was added to the `handleChange` function to improve performance.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

*   Extensive use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library.
*   Use of React Hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`).
*   Form handling with `Form.useForm` and `Form.useWatch` from `gokwik-ui-kit`.
*   Focus on providing a configurable and user-friendly UI for managing various login page elements.
*   Multiple updates to `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` highlight the iterative process of debugging and refining the component's interaction with the form's state.


The series of changes from 17/07/2025, 00:01:10 to 17/07/2025, 00:23:56 indicate focused effort on fixing a bug where the component `bannerComponentRenderer` was not correctly interacting with its form data.  The final version around 00:23:56 appears to resolve this.

The log shows modifications to UI components for a checkout dashboard, specifically focusing on the login page customization.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions between 00:31:46 and 00:49:12 on July 17, 2025.  These changes primarily involved refining the handling of form state updates.  Initially, there were commented-out sections related to `onChange` and `saveConfig` functions suggesting work-in-progress.  Later revisions added `console.log` statements for debugging purposes to observe `form.getFieldsValue()`. The `onValuesChange` handler in the `Form` component was modified to directly update the `ischanged` state, simplifying the logic for enabling/disabling the "Save Changes" button.  The state variable name was also changed from `ischanged` to `setIsDataChanged`

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/customUiHelperFunction.tsx` file was updated at 00:35:34 and again at 00:51:19.  The primary change was the removal of a `colorPicker` component from the `RenderEditorFunction`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` file was modified at 00:51:13 and 00:54:20. These changes introduced a drag-and-drop functionality for managing multiple banner components and added debouncing to the `handleChange` function to improve performance.  A `console.log("triggered")` statement was also added for debugging within the `handleChange` function in the second revision.  The component now allows for adding up to three banners and provides visual feedback with an Alert for the minimum banner requirement.

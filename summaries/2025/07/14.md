# Activity Summary for 14/07/2025

## 14:20:21
The provided log only contains an `.env` file, which is excluded from summarization due to its potential to contain sensitive information like API keys.  Therefore, no summary of code changes can be provided.


## 15:20:27
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file, updated on July 14, 2025 at 15:04:10,  is a crucial component managing environment-specific API URLs.  It defines functions (`getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `getCredUrl`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`, `merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`, `XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that dynamically return URLs based on the current environment (`env` variable), which can be 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production',  and several other environment specific keys.  The logic heavily uses conditional statements to route to different API endpoints based on the environment. A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with hardcoded data.  Noteworthy is the extensive handling of various environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, and several variations) indicating a robust testing and deployment strategy.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file, modified at 15:04:37 on the same day, is a merchant interface HTML page. It uses a custom JavaScript function `gokwikSdk` to initialize and interact with a GoKwik SDK (likely for checkout functionality).  The script includes logic for handling cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) to track landing page and referrer information. The page also includes a button that triggers a `goKwikCheckout` function, which sends merchant information via `window.postMessage`.  The  `window.merchantInfo` object contains crucial merchant details including environment (`local`),  merchant ID (`mid`), app IDs, and other specifics.  The commented-out code suggests that analytics implementation may be in progress.


Finally, the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/styles/global.scss` file, updated at 15:06:05, contains a comprehensive set of SCSS styles.  It defines numerous CSS classes for padding, margins, text styles, flexbox layouts, borders, and colors,  using a consistent naming convention (e.g., `p-0`, `mt-1`, `text-lg`). It uses a variable scheme for color definitions suggesting use of a separate color file. The presence of classes related to different font sizes, colors, and spacing patterns suggests a style guide or design system is employed.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/utils/TextConstants.ts` file, updated at 15:08:31, contains various constants used throughout the application, including text strings for UI elements, error messages, and placeholders.  The file's structure is organized into sections based on functionality (Address, Header, Common, MobileNumber, etc.).  The inclusion of error messages, placeholders, and various UI text strings demonstrates a well-structured approach for managing localized text.  Noteworthy are constants related to discount codes (`Discounts`), gift cards (`GiftCards`), and order status (`OrderPendingPage`).


## 16:20:24
The provided code represents updates to a checkout UI.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/utils/TextConstants.ts` file (updated 14/07/2025, 15:23:15) contains numerous constants for UI text, including messages for various scenarios (address updates, payment failures, etc.), and header/button text.  The constants are categorized into logical groups (Address, Header, Common, MobileNumber, etc.), suggesting a well-organized approach to internationalization or localization.  There's a significant number of error messages, indicating a focus on user experience and error handling.  The `OrderSummary` constant notably includes a large array of properties, likely representing fields for various product customization options.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` file (updated 14/07/2025, 15:34:01) is a Svelte component displaying an order summary. This component heavily relies on numerous stores from `LoginStore`, `CommonStore`, and `OrderStore`, managing various aspects of the checkout process (discount codes, addresses, payment methods, etc.).  The component dynamically updates the total price based on discounts, shipping, taxes, and other factors.  It includes logic for handling free gifts, loyalty points, and various payment scenarios.  The component uses several other Svelte components (Discounts, TotalContainer, Promotion, etc.), showcasing a modular design. The extensive use of reactive statements (`$:`), subscriptions (`subscribe`), and `afterUpdate` lifecycle hooks highlights the component's dynamic and reactive nature, updating the UI in response to changes in the application state.  The code demonstrates an effort to track events using `fireGtmEvent` and `fireAnalyticsGa4`.

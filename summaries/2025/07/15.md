# Activity Summary for 15/07/2025

## 14:25:45
The log shows significant development on the `checkout-dashboard-ui` project between 13:44 and 14:15 on July 15, 2025.  The primary focus appears to be on enhancing the UI customization features, specifically within the login section.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions. Initially, it was a simple component rendering a "bannerComponentRenderer" div.  It was then substantially changed to incorporate a `RichTextEditor` component, allowing for richer banner content editing.  The prop names were adjusted from `repsonseText` to `selectedValue` for better clarity,  and logging statements were added and subsequently removed during the iterative development process. The final version connects to a `RichTextEditor` component, but the `onChange` handler is left empty.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` file showcases the integration of the `bannerComponentRenderer` component. This file implements a form for customizing the login section's UI, including banner, CTA button text, and consent section. It utilizes various UI components from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and manages component visibility and data updates using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. The form submits data using `deepEqualAndDiff` for efficient comparison and update handling.  The multiple revisions of this file are minor, suggesting mostly UI refinements or bug fixes.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` file defines numerous interfaces for various data structures used within the application, likely related to order management, cart items, and user configurations.  The changes between the two timestamps on this file are minimal, showing only a minor change of timestamp.  The interfaces are extensive, reflecting a complex data model.  This suggests a well-structured backend system interacting with the front-end UI.


## 16:25:53
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` project, primarily focused on refining the `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` and `login.tsx` components.

The earliest changes (14:29:21 - 14:31:29) in `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` involved adding state management using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to handle banner data and update changes.  The initial `htmlString` in the `useState` was modified to default to the `selectedValue` prop or an empty string. These changes aim to improve the component's responsiveness and data handling.

Subsequently,  a significant change occurred in `interface.ts` at 14:34:12, adding several new interfaces defining data structures for various entities, such as input options, search filters, price breakdowns, order details, line items, discounts, and cart items. This suggests a restructuring or expansion of the application's data model.  After this update, there is a small change at 14:34:58 in `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx`, altering the default values of the `useState` hook for `bannerData` to empty arrays instead of empty strings, likely anticipating the handling of multiple banners.

The `login.tsx` file was updated at 14:37:58. This commit introduces a form component for managing login UI settings, including rich text editors for banners and consent text, color pickers for background and text colors, and switches for visibility controls. The component uses custom hooks (`useMerchantConfigApi`) to manage configurations and saves updated settings to the server using `saveConfig`.

Between 15:09:19 and 15:59:26, `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` undergoes extensive revision.  The initial single RichTextEditor is replaced with a system that allows for multiple banner components. This involves managing an array of banner data and adding/removing individual components via buttons. The delete functionality was initially flawed but gradually refined.  There was a period of experimentation with different approaches for managing the array of banner components, including using array indices and then transitioning to using unique IDs to track and manage the components.

Finally, the last few commits (16:02:16 to 16:24:26) in `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` focus on improving the user interface (UI) for adding and deleting banners and using a `Row` and `Col` component layout, leading to a more polished and functional multi-banner editing component. The final version uses a more robust system for managing the addition and deletion of banner components. The primary change involved replacing the previous array of numbers with a system using unique IDs to track and manage the components.  The UI is refined further to improve the Delete functionality.


In summary, the log demonstrates iterative development, starting with basic state management in `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx`, expanding the data model in `interface.ts`, building a complex settings form in `login.tsx`, and culminating in a refined, multi-banner editing experience in `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx`.  The repeated updates to `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` highlight the challenges in correctly managing the state and UI for a dynamic component.  A key pattern is the frequent updates to the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage component state.

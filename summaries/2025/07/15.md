# Activity Summary for 15/07/2025

## 14:25:45
The log shows significant development on the `checkout-dashboard-ui` project between 13:44 and 14:15 on July 15, 2025.  The primary focus appears to be on enhancing the UI customization features, specifically within the login section.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` file underwent multiple revisions. Initially, it was a simple component rendering a "bannerComponentRenderer" div.  It was then substantially changed to incorporate a `RichTextEditor` component, allowing for richer banner content editing.  The prop names were adjusted from `repsonseText` to `selectedValue` for better clarity,  and logging statements were added and subsequently removed during the iterative development process. The final version connects to a `RichTextEditor` component, but the `onChange` handler is left empty.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` file showcases the integration of the `bannerComponentRenderer` component. This file implements a form for customizing the login section's UI, including banner, CTA button text, and consent section. It utilizes various UI components from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and manages component visibility and data updates using `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. The form submits data using `deepEqualAndDiff` for efficient comparison and update handling.  The multiple revisions of this file are minor, suggesting mostly UI refinements or bug fixes.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` file defines numerous interfaces for various data structures used within the application, likely related to order management, cart items, and user configurations.  The changes between the two timestamps on this file are minimal, showing only a minor change of timestamp.  The interfaces are extensive, reflecting a complex data model.  This suggests a well-structured backend system interacting with the front-end UI.

# Activity Summary for 18/07/2025

The provided log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/` directory, focusing on UI customization for mobile checkout, login, and payments pages.  The changes span from July 17th, 2025, 23:24 to July 18th, 2025, 09:38.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**: This file underwent numerous revisions.  Initial changes involved adding UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` to render a mobile checkout preview, including sections for brand, login, payment, address, and coupons.  Subsequent revisions focused on refining the layout using `Row` and `Col` components for better responsiveness,  improving the display of coupons and discount offers, and enhancing the visual presentation.  The most significant changes involved modifying the Carousel component, initially adjusting styling and then implementing autoplay,  setting the `speed` property, and finally adding `fade` and `autoplaySpeed` properties to improve the user experience of the carousel. The final change also improved the handling of banner content for the login and payments sections.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/paymentsPage.tsx`**:  These files received updates around the same time as `mobilePage.tsx`. The changes primarily involved improving the handling of the `banner_timer` property in the `useEffect` hook, ensuring that the default value is correctly set and updated when fetching data from the server. This ensures consistency across different screens.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx`**: This component was modified to handle multiple banners. It added drag-and-drop functionality for reordering banners and introduced an `InputNumber` component to set a timer for banners.  A crucial change involved correctly constructing the `name` attribute for the `Form.Item` component  using array concatenation to ensure proper data binding.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**:  This component, used for rich text editing in banners, was improved. The `handleInputChange` function was updated from using a `React.FormEvent` to a `React.KeyboardEvent` to better control the input, fixing an issue with the text length. It now trims the text if it exceeds 64 characters and correctly uses `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to avoid unnecessary default behavior.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/analyticsHeader.tsx`**: This component shows a single update at the end of the log. This update is unrelated to the previous changes and involves adding functionality to handle different analytics screens ('Checkout Analytics', 'Discount Analytics', 'Website Analytics').  The screen displayed is controlled by a `Segmented` component and uses Redux to manage the current screen state. The component also allows selection of different checkout platforms and sales channels.

A common pattern across all the files is the use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library, `react-redux` for state management, and a consistent styling approach. The updates show a clear focus on improving the user interface and functionality of the customization dashboard.

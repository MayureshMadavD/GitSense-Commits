# Activity Summary for 18/07/2025

## 09:42:26
The provided log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/` directory, focusing on UI customization for mobile checkout, login, and payments pages.  The changes span from July 17th, 2025, 23:24 to July 18th, 2025, 09:38.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/mobilePage.tsx`**: This file underwent numerous revisions.  Initial changes involved adding UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` to render a mobile checkout preview, including sections for brand, login, payment, address, and coupons.  Subsequent revisions focused on refining the layout using `Row` and `Col` components for better responsiveness,  improving the display of coupons and discount offers, and enhancing the visual presentation.  The most significant changes involved modifying the Carousel component, initially adjusting styling and then implementing autoplay,  setting the `speed` property, and finally adding `fade` and `autoplaySpeed` properties to improve the user experience of the carousel. The final change also improved the handling of banner content for the login and payments sections.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/loginPage.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/paymentsPage.tsx`**:  These files received updates around the same time as `mobilePage.tsx`. The changes primarily involved improving the handling of the `banner_timer` property in the `useEffect` hook, ensuring that the default value is correctly set and updated when fetching data from the server. This ensures consistency across different screens.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx`**: This component was modified to handle multiple banners. It added drag-and-drop functionality for reordering banners and introduced an `InputNumber` component to set a timer for banners.  A crucial change involved correctly constructing the `name` attribute for the `Form.Item` component  using array concatenation to ensure proper data binding.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`**:  This component, used for rich text editing in banners, was improved. The `handleInputChange` function was updated from using a `React.FormEvent` to a `React.KeyboardEvent` to better control the input, fixing an issue with the text length. It now trims the text if it exceeds 64 characters and correctly uses `e.preventDefault()` and `e.stopPropagation()` to avoid unnecessary default behavior.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/analyticsHeader.tsx`**: This component shows a single update at the end of the log. This update is unrelated to the previous changes and involves adding functionality to handle different analytics screens ('Checkout Analytics', 'Discount Analytics', 'Website Analytics').  The screen displayed is controlled by a `Segmented` component and uses Redux to manage the current screen state. The component also allows selection of different checkout platforms and sales channels.

A common pattern across all the files is the use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library, `react-redux` for state management, and a consistent styling approach. The updates show a clear focus on improving the user interface and functionality of the customization dashboard.


## 10:42:07
The provided log shows updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/analytics/analyticsHeader.tsx` at 09:44:15 and 09:48:08 on July 18, 2025.  The changes are minor and primarily involve moving the `screenOptions` constant declaration. The code defines a React component `AnalyticsHeader` for an analytics dashboard.  This component uses various UI elements from `gokwik-ui-kit` (like `AnalyticsDateRangePicker`, `Select`, `Segmented`, and `Col`), React Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`), and single-spa (`navigateToUrl`).  The component handles date range selection, sales channel filtering, and screen selection ("Checkout Analytics," "Discount Analytics," "Website Analytics").  It also logs events using `logEvent` from `@library/utilities/userLogEvents/userLogEvents`  The logic for displaying certain options depends on the user's email and the merchant's platform (specifically checking for `@gokwik.co` emails and a `shopify` platform). Date selection is constrained to a 90-day window relative to the selected date, with a minimum selectable date of April 1st, 2025 for website analytics.


The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` was updated at 09:52:54 on July 18, 2025. This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML for a dashboard, based on environment variables (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  The generated HTML includes import maps for various Gokwik modules (@gokwik/*) with different URLs depending on the environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The production environment additionally includes Clarity.ms and New Relic script tags, suggesting performance monitoring and analytics are implemented in production.  The import map includes links to React, React-DOM, and single-spa libraries from CDN.  The local environment uses localhost URLs, while other environments use URLs from `dev.gokwik.in`.


## 15:26:23
The primary change involves `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` on 18/07/2025 at 15:11:10.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically loads JavaScript modules based on the environment (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`).  The template includes CDN links for React, React-DOM, and Single-SPA. It also dynamically includes import maps for various @gokwik modules,  with URLs changing depending on whether the application is running locally, or in a dev, qa, sandbox, or production environment.  The production environment also includes  Clarity and New Relic scripts.  The conditional inclusion of these scripts suggests a build process that tailors the application to different deployment stages.  The New Relic scripts include extensive code for error handling, performance monitoring, and data collection.  There is a clear pattern of using  `@gokwik/*`  for internal modules. The structure suggests a microservices architecture, where individual components (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment etc.) are loaded separately.


## 17:18:24
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` file was updated on 18/07/2025 at 15:53:44.  The update significantly modified the component's rendering logic and functionality.

Key changes include:

* **Conditional Rendering based on User Roles and Configuration:** The component now conditionally renders different settings options based on whether the user is a merchant, the `config` object's properties (e.g., `diy_enabled`, `supported_checkout_configs`), and the `showDiscountConfigs` variable. This introduces significant flexibility in the settings presented to different user types.

* **E-Sign Agreement Integration:**  A new e-signature agreement flow (`GokwikAgreement` component) was added.  This section involves API calls (`makeAPICall`) to fetch agreement details, manage polling for updates (using `setInterval` and `clearInterval`), and update the UI based on the agreement status. The agreement status is fetched using `process.env.REACT_APP_BASE_URL` (which is masked as it's an environment variable).  The agreement expiry date is displayed to the user.


* **Improved Menu Structure:**  The settings menu is dynamically generated using `useMemo` based on the user's role and configuration.  The `settingsList` array is constructed conditionally, creating a custom menu structure.  Menu item selection logs events using the `logEvent` function, specific to different menu items.

* **Navigation Management:**  The component uses `useNavigate` and `useLocation` from `react-router-dom` to manage navigation within the settings page.  The `useEffect` hook ensures a default setting page is displayed upon initial navigation to the settings page.


* **Extensive Use of Hooks:** The code makes extensive use of React Hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useEffect`, `useSelector`) for managing state, side effects, and optimization.

* **Modular Design:** The component is highly modular, utilizing several imported sub-components (e.g., `Pincode`, `Shipping`, `CheckoutConfigs`, `BulkDiscounts`, etc.) to manage different settings sections.

In summary, the update represents a substantial revision to the settings page, adding features for e-signature agreements, dynamic settings rendering based on user roles and configuration, and improved navigation and modularity.


## 18:18:23
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` file was updated on 18/07/2025, 17:19:33.  The update significantly revised the component's rendering logic and functionality.  Key changes include:

* **Addition of Agreement Functionality:**  A major addition is the implementation of an e-signature agreement (`GokwikAgreement` component). This involves fetching agreement data via API calls (`makeAPICall`), polling for updates (`startPolling`, `stopPolling`, `fetchLatestAgreementStatusWithPolling`), and managing agreement status (`showAgreementPage`, `isAgreementReady`, `eSignData`).  The UI dynamically switches between showing the main settings menu and the agreement page.

* **Settings Menu Refactoring:** The settings menu (`settingsList`, `menuItems`) is now dynamically generated based on user roles (merchant or not), configuration settings (`config`, `showDiscountConfigs`), and `checkoutPlatform`. This allows for conditional rendering of various settings pages (Pin Codes, Shipping, Discounts, Payments, etc.).  The menu structure uses a nested `MenuItem` structure for organization.

* **Improved Routing:**  The component utilizes `react-router-dom` for navigation, and keeps track of the previously opened menu item (`previousOpenedItems`).  Navigation events are logged using `logEvent`.

* **Enhanced Error Handling:** Basic error handling is included in API calls.

* **Data Fetching and Management:** The component fetches data from Redux store using `useSelector` (e.g., `getMerchantDetails`, `getUserConfig`) and makes API calls to retrieve user details, agreement data, and legality information.


The code extensively uses React hooks (`useState`, `useMemo`, `useRef`, `useEffect`) and components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and other internal libraries.  The pattern of fetching data from API endpoints and updating the UI based on the fetched data is repeated multiple times.  The code is well-structured, using functional components and leveraging React's features to manage state and side effects.


## 18:18:38
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file underwent several revisions between 17:26:38 and 17:27:21 on July 18, 2025.  The core functionality remained consistent: defining functions to return URLs based on the current environment (`env`).  These functions target various services, including health checks (`getHealthServiceBaseUrl`), address suggestions (`getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`), APIs (`api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`), and CDN paths (`cdn_path`).  They also manage tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) and merchant URLs (`merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`).

The most significant change involved the `api_url` function.  Initially, the `local` environment pointed to different URLs across the different revisions,  eventually settling on `https://api.gokwik.co`.  This suggests debugging or testing across various environments.  The `setCart` function remained unchanged throughout the revisions, suggesting this is not a focus of these code changes.  The overall pattern is extensive use of conditional logic to switch between URLs based on the `env` variable, indicating a robust approach to managing different deployment environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  The frequent small changes within this short timeframe might be due to rapid iterative debugging or testing.


## 19:19:12
The code changes on July 18, 2025, at approximately 18:37 involve two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated at 18:37:02.  This file contains a significant amount of JavaScript code focused on managing environment-specific URLs for various API endpoints (health, address suggestion, core API, cred, experiment, twidpay, kp, cdn, and analytics).  The code uses an `env` variable to determine the appropriate URL based on the environment (e.g., 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', 'local').  A substantial number of conditional statements handle different environment configurations. The code also includes functions to set and retrieve cookie data.  A notable function `setCart` initializes a cart object with a large amount of data, including product details.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated at 18:37:13, slightly after the `EnvironmentService.ts` file. This file is an HTML page containing a button that triggers a checkout process. JavaScript code within this file initializes a `gokwikSdk` object, responsible for handling communication with the Gokwik SDK (likely a payment gateway).  It uses postMessage to communicate with another part of the application.  The `merchantInfo` object contains data like merchant ID (`mid`), app ID, app secret, store ID, and Facebook Pixel ID. The `environment` variable within `merchantInfo` is set to `'local'`, suggesting this HTML file is intended for local development.  The page also includes a commented-out section that previously included analytics script and code snippets related to loading the Gokwik checkout JavaScript file.  The script also includes functionality to set and retrieve cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`).


## 20:18:23
The provided code represents a Svelte component (`PSPOrderButtons.svelte`) responsible for rendering payment buttons, primarily focusing on UPI payment methods.  The log shows three revisions of the component within a short time frame (18/07/2025, between 19:23:24 and 19:27:02).  The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions, but minor changes were made.

The most significant change occurred between the first and third revisions. The addition of `store_automationData` to the imported stores in the third revision suggests an enhancement to incorporate automation data into the payment button logic, potentially for A/B testing or other automated processes.  This is a notable functional change.

All three revisions show a heavy reliance on various Svelte stores (`store_*`), indicating a reactive approach to updating the UI based on application state. The component handles different UPI applications (PhonePe, G Pay, Paytm, etc.), dynamically adjusting their visibility based on factors like operating system, user settings (`store_showAllUpis`, `store_upiPaymentOptionsAvailable`), and experiment variations (`store_upiAppsConfigExperiment`).  The logic extensively uses conditional rendering and filtering to display relevant buttons. The code also manages UI elements like loaders and timers.  The use of `onMount`, `afterUpdate`, and `subscribe` functions points to the component's interactive and dynamic nature.  No structural changes were observed in the code, only additions to existing functionality.


## 21:18:21
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/productSearch.tsx` between 20:27:23 and 20:27:51 on July 18, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on the `productSearch` component, which handles searching and adding products or collections to a discount.

The core functionality remains consistent throughout the revisions, but minor modifications were made to the code.  These alterations predominantly involve handling of product thumbnail URLs (`product?.product_thumbnail_url`) for better null safety and potentially fixing a bug related to how the URLs were being accessed.  The overall structure of the component—including its use of `useEffect` hooks for fetching data, debouncing searches, and pagination—did not change significantly.  The timestamps suggest a rapid iteration cycle during development or debugging. No significant functional changes were observed beyond the minor adjustments to the `product_thumbnail_url` handling.

# Activity Summary for 21/07/2025

## 15:50:13
The log shows modifications to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx`.  The `brandPage.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 13:59:59 and 15:14:19, primarily focusing on UI enhancements and bug fixes related to logo uploading and primary color selection within a settings page.  The changes include logging statements added for debugging purposes, and minor UI adjustments, mostly concerning commented out code, which is a common pattern in development.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was modified at 13:55:32, 14:15:20, and 14:27:09 and 14:36:50. These changes involve updates to the import maps within the EJS template, dynamically adjusting the URLs based on the `deployedEnv` variable (values like 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production'). This suggests a system designed for multi-environment deployment, switching between different API endpoints and resources depending on the environment. The consistency across these revisions indicates a stable structure for environment configuration.  Note that the same code changes were introduced in multiple revisions of the same file.

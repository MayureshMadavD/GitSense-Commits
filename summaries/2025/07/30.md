# Activity Summary for 30/07/2025

## 00:07:08
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` between 23:32:08 and 23:52:19 on July 29, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `Merchant` component, focusing on its rendering and functionality.

The most significant change is the addition of the `Alert` component from `antd`  around 23:44:02.  Subsequent commits made minor adjustments to the component's code, but no further major structural alterations were observed.  The `formFeilds` array, defining the form's structure and input fields, remained largely consistent throughout all revisions.  This array includes fields for various merchant details such as name, CE name, type, ARR, and go-live dates, suggesting a comprehensive merchant management interface.  The `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` array is also present in all commits, defining columns for a data table, displaying filtered and sortable merchant information.  There is consistent use of Ant Design components throughout the component, indicating a reliance on this UI library.  The inclusion of functions for data filtering and export (`createOptionsListForFilter`, `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`, `exportDataToCsv`) point towards robust data management capabilities.  There are also functions for interacting with a backend (`createNewMerchant`, `deletEntryForMerchant`, `updateMerchantByID`).  The code consistently handles potential errors from backend requests using `message.success` and `message.error` from antd.  Finally, the addition of `isFieldChanged` variable near 23:44:02, suggests the implementation of change tracking or handling of form submission logic.


## 12:45:01
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` was updated twice, at 12:01:54 and 12:03:20.  Both updates appear to be minor modifications within the Svelte component managing order summaries. The changes likely involve adjustments to the display of order details, free gifts, and pricing calculations, based on the presence of numerous variables related to discounts, shipping, taxes, and payment methods.  The second update appears to be a minor adjustment as the code is largely unchanged.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated once at 12:16:09. This file handles environment-specific configurations, including base URLs for various APIs (health service, address suggestions, etc.). The update likely involves either the addition of new environment configurations or changes to existing URL endpoints. The numerous `else if` statements suggest a comprehensive handling of multiple environment variables (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The update includes a modification to the `setCart()` function, changing the cart data that gets set for the 'local' environment.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated once at 12:16:27.  This is an HTML file likely responsible for rendering the merchant's checkout page. The update changed the `mid` value within the `window.merchantInfo` object from `'3mt5u7wu46l3sja2lw'` to `'3mt5u7wu46l3sja2lw'`. This suggests that the merchant ID was updated. The file includes JavaScript code for handling communication with a Gokwik SDK and setting cookies to track landing pages and referrer URLs.  The presence of commented-out code suggests ongoing development and experimentation.

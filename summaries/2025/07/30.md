# Activity Summary for 30/07/2025

## 00:07:08
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` between 23:32:08 and 23:52:19 on July 29, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `Merchant` component, focusing on its rendering and functionality.

The most significant change is the addition of the `Alert` component from `antd`  around 23:44:02.  Subsequent commits made minor adjustments to the component's code, but no further major structural alterations were observed.  The `formFeilds` array, defining the form's structure and input fields, remained largely consistent throughout all revisions.  This array includes fields for various merchant details such as name, CE name, type, ARR, and go-live dates, suggesting a comprehensive merchant management interface.  The `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` array is also present in all commits, defining columns for a data table, displaying filtered and sortable merchant information.  There is consistent use of Ant Design components throughout the component, indicating a reliance on this UI library.  The inclusion of functions for data filtering and export (`createOptionsListForFilter`, `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`, `exportDataToCsv`) point towards robust data management capabilities.  There are also functions for interacting with a backend (`createNewMerchant`, `deletEntryForMerchant`, `updateMerchantByID`).  The code consistently handles potential errors from backend requests using `message.success` and `message.error` from antd.  Finally, the addition of `isFieldChanged` variable near 23:44:02, suggests the implementation of change tracking or handling of form submission logic.


## 12:45:01
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` was updated twice, at 12:01:54 and 12:03:20.  Both updates appear to be minor modifications within the Svelte component managing order summaries. The changes likely involve adjustments to the display of order details, free gifts, and pricing calculations, based on the presence of numerous variables related to discounts, shipping, taxes, and payment methods.  The second update appears to be a minor adjustment as the code is largely unchanged.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated once at 12:16:09. This file handles environment-specific configurations, including base URLs for various APIs (health service, address suggestions, etc.). The update likely involves either the addition of new environment configurations or changes to existing URL endpoints. The numerous `else if` statements suggest a comprehensive handling of multiple environment variables (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The update includes a modification to the `setCart()` function, changing the cart data that gets set for the 'local' environment.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated once at 12:16:27.  This is an HTML file likely responsible for rendering the merchant's checkout page. The update changed the `mid` value within the `window.merchantInfo` object from `'3mt5u7wu46l3sja2lw'` to `'3mt5u7wu46l3sja2lw'`. This suggests that the merchant ID was updated. The file includes JavaScript code for handling communication with a Gokwik SDK and setting cookies to track landing pages and referrer URLs.  The presence of commented-out code suggests ongoing development and experimentation.


## 14:45:07
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project between 13:46 and 14:43 on July 30, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the order summary component (`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte`) and its related files.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice within a short time frame (13:46:46 and 13:47:02). These updates involved minor adjustments to the `api_url` function, specifically changing the URL used for the 'local' environment from various test URLs to `https://api.gokwik.co`.  The `EnvironmentService` file manages API base URLs based on different environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 13:50:16. This update includes modifications to the embedded Javascript, primarily focusing on handling merchant information and the initialization of a Gokwik SDK.  It seems to handle communication with the main Gokwik application through postMessage.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/TotalContainer.svelte` (updated at 14:12:17)  displays the order summary details, including subtotal, discounts (coupon, automatic, loyalty, prepaid), and gift card amounts.  It heavily relies on Svelte stores for data binding and updates.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` underwent numerous updates between 14:21:51 and 14:43:24.  These updates primarily involved refining the logic for calculating `totalPrice`, incorporating various discounts (prepaid, coupon, loyalty, etc.), and handling different scenarios (e.g., cart updates, presence of free products, specific payment methods).  The component also manages the visibility of the order summary drawer and incorporates various event tracking mechanisms using `fireGtmEvent` and `fireAnalyticsGa4`. There were multiple minor changes in these updates that involve updating conditionals and logic for prepaid discount calculations and handling cart updates more efficiently.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderPage.svelte` was updated twice at 14:27:17 and 14:28:20. The change involves removing the key attribute from the OrderSummary component.


The recurring pattern across many changes is the extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_*`) to manage application state and trigger UI updates.  The code also shows a significant focus on handling various discount types and payment scenarios, suggesting a complex checkout process. The frequent updates to `OrderSummary.svelte` indicate an iterative refinement of the order summary display and its interaction with other parts of the application.

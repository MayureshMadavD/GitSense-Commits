# Activity Summary for 30/07/2025

## 00:07:08
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` between 23:32:08 and 23:52:19 on July 29, 2025.  The changes primarily involve the `Merchant` component, focusing on its rendering and functionality.

The most significant change is the addition of the `Alert` component from `antd`  around 23:44:02.  Subsequent commits made minor adjustments to the component's code, but no further major structural alterations were observed.  The `formFeilds` array, defining the form's structure and input fields, remained largely consistent throughout all revisions.  This array includes fields for various merchant details such as name, CE name, type, ARR, and go-live dates, suggesting a comprehensive merchant management interface.  The `MERCHANT_COLUMN_LIST` array is also present in all commits, defining columns for a data table, displaying filtered and sortable merchant information.  There is consistent use of Ant Design components throughout the component, indicating a reliance on this UI library.  The inclusion of functions for data filtering and export (`createOptionsListForFilter`, `getDateRangeFilterDropdown`, `exportDataToCsv`) point towards robust data management capabilities.  There are also functions for interacting with a backend (`createNewMerchant`, `deletEntryForMerchant`, `updateMerchantByID`).  The code consistently handles potential errors from backend requests using `message.success` and `message.error` from antd.  Finally, the addition of `isFieldChanged` variable near 23:44:02, suggests the implementation of change tracking or handling of form submission logic.

# Activity Summary for 11/07/2025

## 17:09:14
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` between 16:11:38 and 17:07:01 on November 7, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor refinements and bug fixes rather than large-scale changes to the functionality of the MerchantAPI. There are no discernible patterns in the content changes beyond repeated modifications within the existing function definitions.  The file is primarily focused on asynchronous API calls (`getCall`, `postCall`, `GET`, `POST`),  handling requests related to various aspects of an e-commerce checkout process, including cart management, user authentication, address management, and analytics.  The code extensively uses store subscriptions (`store_...`) suggesting a reactive architecture using a state management library.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` file was updated three times between 16:13:31 and 16:14:40 on November 7, 2025. These updates also seem to be minor changes within the existing codebase. The file is a Svelte component responsible for rendering the merchant's checkout interface, integrating with various analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics), and handling communication with the backend via message events.  The updates involve handling of cookies, URL parameters, and merchant information, suggesting improvements to the initialization and data flow within the component.

The log shows updates to two files on November 7th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts`  was updated at 17:47:57. This file contains numerous asynchronous functions for interacting with a merchant API.  These functions handle various aspects of the checkout process, including:  retrieving cart information (`getCartJs`, `getAbandonCart`), managing requests (`getRequestId`, `apiRequestProcessingQueue`), handling user experiments (`getUserExperiments`, `assignUserVariant`), managing phone numbers and login (`submitPhoneNumber`, `checkLogin`), managing addresses (`deleteAddress`, `verifyPincode`, `addAddress`, `getAllAddress`, `editAddress`, `callAddressSuggestApi`), and updating cart analytics (`updateCartAnalytics`).  The code extensively uses observables from various stores (OrderStore, LoginStore, CommonStore) to access and update application state.  Many functions include error handling (try...catch blocks) and conditional logic based on merchant information and various flags. The consistent use of `x-gokwik-token` and other headers in API calls suggests authentication and tracking mechanisms are in place.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/ConfirmPopup.svelte` was updated at 18:08:41. This Svelte component renders a confirmation popup during checkout.  The popup's content and functionality vary based on several factors:  the current page in the checkout flow, the presence of discounts or free gifts (`$store_discountAmount`, `$store_giftCardTotal`, `$store_prepaidDiscount`), whether a free product was added (`$store_freeProductAdded`), and whether a payment method was selected (`$store_selectedPaymentOptionButton`).  The component utilizes several functions from `MerchantAPI` (e.g., `saveExitReasons`, `updateCart`) and handles various payment scenarios including BNPL (Buy Now, Pay Later). It also incorporates exit flow feedback (`exit_flow_feedback`) based on user selections, logging events using `logEvent` from `EventService`.  Conditional rendering is heavily used to dynamically display different messages and buttons depending on the checkout state.  The `onMount` lifecycle hook is used for initialization and subscriptions to numerous stores for reactive updates.

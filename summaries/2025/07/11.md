# Activity Summary for 11/07/2025

## 17:09:14
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` between 16:11:38 and 17:07:01 on November 7, 2025.  These updates appear to be minor refinements and bug fixes rather than large-scale changes to the functionality of the MerchantAPI. There are no discernible patterns in the content changes beyond repeated modifications within the existing function definitions.  The file is primarily focused on asynchronous API calls (`getCall`, `postCall`, `GET`, `POST`),  handling requests related to various aspects of an e-commerce checkout process, including cart management, user authentication, address management, and analytics.  The code extensively uses store subscriptions (`store_...`) suggesting a reactive architecture using a state management library.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` file was updated three times between 16:13:31 and 16:14:40 on November 7, 2025. These updates also seem to be minor changes within the existing codebase. The file is a Svelte component responsible for rendering the merchant's checkout interface, integrating with various analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics), and handling communication with the backend via message events.  The updates involve handling of cookies, URL parameters, and merchant information, suggesting improvements to the initialization and data flow within the component.

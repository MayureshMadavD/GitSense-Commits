The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx` was updated on 21/07/2025 at 22:39:23.  This React component (`BrandPage`) allows users to customize their brand's appearance within a checkout dashboard.  Key updates include:

* **Logo Upload and Management:** The component implements logo uploading with validation (file type and size).  Uploaded logos are stored with a timestamped path (`merchant/${merchant_details.m_id}/logo${timeStamp}/${file.name.split('.').pop()}`) and their URLs are fetched using API calls to  `APIEndPoints.presingedLogoUrl` and `APIEndPoints.downloadLogo`.  The component also displays a preview of the uploaded logo.  Base64 encoding is used for immediate display.

* **Color Customization:** A `ColorPicketComponent` allows users to select a primary color for the checkout theme.  This color is stored within the `brand_data.cssRules.primaryColor` field.

* **API Interactions:**  Multiple API calls are made using `makeAPICall` to  `APIEndPoints.updateMerchant`, `APIEndPoints.presingedLogoUrl`, and `APIEndPoints.downloadLogo` for managing brand data, logo uploads and retrieval.  The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is used for fetching and saving configuration data.

* **Redux Integration:**  The component uses Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`, `updateBrandData`, `updatedLogoData`) for managing application state, specifically brand data and logo updates.

* **Form Handling:**  A `gokwik-ui-kit` Form component is used to manage user inputs and submission. The `onFinish` handler saves changes via an API call and updates the Redux store.

The code extensively utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and custom hooks for API interactions and state management.  The `useEffect` hook is used in multiple places for fetching initial data, updating the form based on API responses, and dispatching Redux actions.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks and `message.error` for display to the user.

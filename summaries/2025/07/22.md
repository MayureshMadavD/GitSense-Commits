# Activity Summary for 22/07/2025

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customizeUI/brandPage.tsx` was updated on 21/07/2025 at 22:39:23.  This React component (`BrandPage`) allows users to customize their brand's appearance within a checkout dashboard.  Key updates include:

* **Logo Upload and Management:** The component implements logo uploading with validation (file type and size).  Uploaded logos are stored with a timestamped path (`merchant/${merchant_details.m_id}/logo${timeStamp}/${file.name.split('.').pop()}`) and their URLs are fetched using API calls to  `APIEndPoints.presingedLogoUrl` and `APIEndPoints.downloadLogo`.  The component also displays a preview of the uploaded logo.  Base64 encoding is used for immediate display.

* **Color Customization:** A `ColorPicketComponent` allows users to select a primary color for the checkout theme.  This color is stored within the `brand_data.cssRules.primaryColor` field.

* **API Interactions:**  Multiple API calls are made using `makeAPICall` to  `APIEndPoints.updateMerchant`, `APIEndPoints.presingedLogoUrl`, and `APIEndPoints.downloadLogo` for managing brand data, logo uploads and retrieval.  The `useMerchantConfigApi` hook is used for fetching and saving configuration data.

* **Redux Integration:**  The component uses Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`, `updateBrandData`, `updatedLogoData`) for managing application state, specifically brand data and logo updates.

* **Form Handling:**  A `gokwik-ui-kit` Form component is used to manage user inputs and submission. The `onFinish` handler saves changes via an API call and updates the Redux store.

The code extensively utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and custom hooks for API interactions and state management.  The `useEffect` hook is used in multiple places for fetching initial data, updating the form based on API responses, and dispatching Redux actions.  Error handling is implemented using `try...catch` blocks and `message.error` for display to the user.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` file was updated on 22/07/2025 at 12:50:05.  This React component (`BannerComponentRendrer`) renders a UI for managing multiple banner components.  Key features include:

* **Rich Text Editor Integration:** Uses a `RichTextEditor` component for editing banner content.
* **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** Allows users to reorder banners via drag-and-drop functionality.  The `handleDragStart`, `handleDragOver`, and related functions manage this.  Changes are reflected in the UI and a `saveButtonCheck` function is triggered.
* **Add/Delete Banner Functionality:**  `handleAdd` adds new banners (maximum 3), while `handleDelete` removes them.  Both functions update the UI and call `saveButtonCheck`.
* **State Management:** Uses `useState` hooks to manage banner content (`bannerContent`), dragged index (`draggedIndex`), and other UI elements.  `useEffect` is used to synchronize the banner data with a form's field values and dispatch updates to the store (`updateLoginData`, `updatePaymentData`).
* **Data Structure:**  Banner data is structured as an array of objects, each containing an ID and banner content (using `BannerComponentInterface`).  An `emptyBanner` object is used for initialization.
* **UI Library:** Utilizes components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (e.g., `Row`, `Col`, `Button`, `Alert`, `Form`, `TimePicker`, `Timeline`, `InputNumber`).
* **Timer Functionality:** Includes a timer feature controlled by an `InputNumber` component, which is only visible if `isMultiEnable` is true.  The timer value is saved as part of the `login_data` or `payment_data` depending on the `selectedValue`.


The code demonstrates a well-structured component for managing multiple editable banners, incorporating drag-and-drop, add/remove functionality, and state management for both UI updates and data persistence.  The use of `useEffect` ensures data synchronization with the parent form and store.

The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/customize-ui/richtexteditor.tsx`.  The changes span from 12:51 PM to 13:17 PM on July 22, 2025.

`bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` underwent significant changes related to UI enhancements and layout modifications. Initially, the component rendered a rich text editor for banner content, allowing for adding, deleting, and drag-and-drop reordering of banners (maximum 3). A timer input was also included.  Subsequent revisions focused primarily on styling improvements using the `flex` and `Col` components from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The HolderOutlined icon was added to enhance the visual presentation. The code also added a check to make sure there is at least one banner before rendering the component

`richtexteditor.tsx` primarily involved cosmetic UI updates.  The most significant changes involved adding `w-full` classnames and wrapping the elements with flexbox components to improve the layout and responsiveness of the rich text editor. Also added a `HolderOutlined` icon. A new prop, `bannerListLength`, was added to conditionally render the `HolderOutlined` icon based on the number of banners in the list.  The initial version included functionality for bold, italic, underline, and link formatting, along with input validation (64 characters max).  These core functionalities remained consistent throughout the revisions.


## 20:51:54
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated twice on July 22, 2025, at 20:14:14 and 20:14:32.  The changes primarily involve modifications to the `api_url` function.  Specifically, the second update at 20:14:32 changed the URL for the 'local' environment from `https://api.gokwik.co` to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` within the `api_url` function.  Other than this, no significant functional changes appear in the code between these two updates. The code defines multiple functions that return URLs based on the current environment (`env`), which can be 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', or other variations.  These functions handle API calls for various services including health checks, address suggestions, analytics, and payment gateways. The `setCart` function initializes a cart object with detailed product information.  The `XGokwikToken` and `XKWIKPASSToken` functions return different tokens depending on the environment, suggesting they are used for authentication or authorization.  A recurring pattern is the extensive use of conditional statements to select the appropriate URL based on the environment variable.

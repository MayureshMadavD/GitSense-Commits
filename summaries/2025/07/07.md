# Activity Summary for 07/07/2025

## 12:29:45
The log shows two entries for `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, both on July 7th, 2025.  The changes between the two entries are minimal, suggesting a possible accidental double-save or a very minor edit that did not alter the core functionality.  The file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API, experiment, Twidpay, KP, CDN) based on the current environment (`env`).  The `env` variable can take values like `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`, and others, each mapping to a different URL.  There's a significant amount of conditional logic to handle different environments and to provide fallback URLs. The `setCart` function initializes a cart object with specific data, this is only called when `env` is set to 'local'.  The file also defines functions to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which also vary according to the environment.  The timestamps of the edits (12:25:58 and 12:28:55) indicate that the changes were made within a short time span.  The code exhibits a common pattern of conditional URL switching based on the environment, ensuring that the correct API endpoints are used in different development and deployment stages.

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/discounts/create-discounts/manual.tsx` on July 7th, 2025.  The file is a React component for creating and editing manual discounts.

The main changes revolve around the `submitForm` function.  Initially, there was a `return;` statement after getting form values which was removed in later commits.  A significant change was introduced around 14:26:03, where the `discountCodeDetails` field in `currentValues` is split into an array using `split('\n')` if it contains newline characters. This condition was later refined at 14:27:46 to only perform the split if it's the fourth step (`currentStep === 4`).  The unnecessary debugging `console.log` statements were also removed in subsequent commits.


The other changes are minor formatting adjustments, such as adding or removing extra lines or changing the way a link is represented in the `InfoComponent`. The core functionality of creating/editing manual discounts and navigating through the five steps remained consistent throughout the revisions.  The timestamps of significant changes are 14:21:19, 14:26:03, 14:27:46, and 14:28:55.  The consistent use of `Form.useForm`, `useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`, and other hooks indicates a consistent application architecture.

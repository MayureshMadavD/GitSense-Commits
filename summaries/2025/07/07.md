# Activity Summary for 07/07/2025

## 12:29:45
The log shows two entries for `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, both on July 7th, 2025.  The changes between the two entries are minimal, suggesting a possible accidental double-save or a very minor edit that did not alter the core functionality.  The file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API, experiment, Twidpay, KP, CDN) based on the current environment (`env`).  The `env` variable can take values like `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`, and others, each mapping to a different URL.  There's a significant amount of conditional logic to handle different environments and to provide fallback URLs. The `setCart` function initializes a cart object with specific data, this is only called when `env` is set to 'local'.  The file also defines functions to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which also vary according to the environment.  The timestamps of the edits (12:25:58 and 12:28:55) indicate that the changes were made within a short time span.  The code exhibits a common pattern of conditional URL switching based on the environment, ensuring that the correct API endpoints are used in different development and deployment stages.


## 14:29:42
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/discounts/create-discounts/manual.tsx` on July 7th, 2025.  The file is a React component for creating and editing manual discounts.

The main changes revolve around the `submitForm` function.  Initially, there was a `return;` statement after getting form values which was removed in later commits.  A significant change was introduced around 14:26:03, where the `discountCodeDetails` field in `currentValues` is split into an array using `split('\n')` if it contains newline characters. This condition was later refined at 14:27:46 to only perform the split if it's the fourth step (`currentStep === 4`).  The unnecessary debugging `console.log` statements were also removed in subsequent commits.


The other changes are minor formatting adjustments, such as adding or removing extra lines or changing the way a link is represented in the `InfoComponent`. The core functionality of creating/editing manual discounts and navigating through the five steps remained consistent throughout the revisions.  The timestamps of significant changes are 14:21:19, 14:26:03, 14:27:46, and 14:28:55.  The consistent use of `Form.useForm`, `useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`, and other hooks indicates a consistent application architecture.


## 15:29:48
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` project, specifically focusing on discount management features.

The `/src/store/discounts/api.ts` file underwent two nearly identical updates at 14:31:42 and 14:31:58.  These updates consist of a large function `requestMapDiscount.setup`, handling the mapping of discount data, including product and collection IDs,  for various discount types (`cartItemsDiscount`, `bundleDiscount`, `tieredDiscount`, `discountedCartItems`, `shippingDiscount`).  The code extensively uses Shopify's `gid` identifiers and performs complex comparisons and mappings between existing and new discount data using the `mapProducts` function.  This function compares product arrays, identifying products and variants to add or remove based on variant counts. The code also handles different types of discount based on Shopify discount ID.


The `/src/pages/settings/offers-discount/addEditOffer.tsx` file was updated at 14:34:57.  This component is a form for adding or editing discount offers.  It manages various fields such as discount code, description, additional details, visibility, user type (all, new users, repeat users, cohort-based), minimum and maximum price and quantity, and status (active/inactive). It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and performs validation using `validateOfferDiscount` before saving.

The `/src/pages/settings/offers-discount/index.tsx` file was modified three times: at 14:35:02, 14:35:45, and 14:46:04. These updates enhance the UI for managing discount codes. It features a table displaying discount codes, allowing filtering and sorting (by code, description, details, visibility, user type, and status).  The UI includes functionality for creating, editing, deleting, and reordering discount codes.  It uses `makeAPICall` for API interactions, handles updates to discount codes, and dynamically renders the UI based on user configuration (`userConfig.diy_enabled`). The changes between 14:35:02 and 14:35:45 mostly consist of correcting a bug in `updateDiscount` function that was not handling newline characters in `additional_details.bullet_points`. The change at 14:46:04 adds a check to ensure that additional details contain newline characters before splitting them.

The `/src/library/components/discounts/visibility.tsx` file was updated at 14:48:44. This component handles the visibility settings for discount codes. It allows configuring whether to show discount codes to customers, setting descriptions, additional details, and visibility options ('Always' or 'Only When Eligible').  It also includes additional conditions like minimum and maximum price and quantity, and interacts with Redux store using `useAppDispatch` and `useSelector`.

The `/src/pages/settings/discounts/create-discounts/manual.tsx` file was updated at 15:13:38. This component is a multi-step form for creating or editing manual discounts. It uses a `Steps` component to guide the user through the process, with steps for setup, conditions, combinations, customer eligibility, and visibility.  Each step utilizes a separate component (`SetupDiscount`, `DiscountConditions`, `DiscountCombinations`, `DiscountCustomerEligibility`, `DiscountVisibility`). The component interacts with the Redux store to manage discount data.

The `/src/pages/settings/index.tsx` file was updated at 15:14:56. This is the main settings page, acting as a router for different settings sections. It dynamically generates a menu based on user configuration and routes to various components related to pin codes, shipping, discounts, UI customization, etc.  It uses React Router for navigation, Redux for state management, and handles logging of user actions.  It also incorporates an agreement page.

The `/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/index.tsx` file was updated at 15:15:11. This component handles various checkout configurations, including COD limits, blocked discount codes, tiered discounts, sales channel specific discounts, dynamic discounts, buy X at Y discounts, discount applicability, discount capping, and GWP with any discount. Each configuration is handled by a separate component.


In summary, the code changes demonstrate a focused effort on building and refining a comprehensive discount management system within the checkout dashboard UI. The system supports various discount types, integrates with Shopify, provides detailed configuration options, and is designed for both creation and editing of discounts.  The use of Redux and React Router is consistent throughout the codebase.


## 19:29:46
The log shows code changes across two files on July 7th, 2025.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated at 19:00:20.  This update primarily involved modifications to the client-side JavaScript code handling merchant information and the GoKwik checkout process.  The code includes functions for payment processing via `window.postMessage`,  event handling (`on`, `emit`),  and initialization (`init`).  It also manages cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`) to track landing page and referrer information.  The most significant changes are related to how merchant information (`window.merchantInfo`) is structured and sent,  including a large number of commented-out `mid` values suggesting experimentation with various merchant IDs across different environments (e.g.,  'local', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production').  There's also some commented out code that appears to be related to loading the GoKwik script dynamically and including an analytics script. The code also shows integration with a third-party widget ("Privy").


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated twice, at 19:00:42 and 19:01:27. These updates concern environment-specific API URLs and configuration.  The file contains functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health check, address suggestions, etc.) based on the environment variable `env`.  The `api_url` function contains a large switch statement defining URLs for different environments ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and several other internal environments).  There's also functions defining tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that vary depending on the environment.  The second update (19:01:27) modified the `setCart` function, changing the cart object's data, specifically the token and attributes.  This suggests changes were likely made to the data being stored within the cart object. The updates show a extensive use of different environments, and a complex logic to handle requests based on the current environment.


## 20:29:47
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions/PaymentsHeader/PaymentHeaderShipping.svelte` on July 7, 2025.  The file is a Svelte component responsible for displaying and handling shipping method selection in a checkout UI.

The changes primarily involve refinements to the UI and debugging.  Between 20:11:14 and 20:16:06, several commits added `typeof` checks to the `method.id` and `selectedShippingMethod?.id` variables within the component's template, likely to address type-related issues or inconsistencies during rendering.  This suggests a debugging effort to ensure correct data handling and display of shipping options.


At 20:18:23 a minor styling adjustment removed the border from the `.option-card`  class in the  scss stylesheet, and re-added it in the next commit at 20:21:53. Finally, at 20:28:10 the `readonly` attribute was removed from the radio button in the  `radio-wrapper` class, likely to allow the user to actually select shipping methods.  The overall pattern indicates iterative improvements to the component's functionality and visual presentation.

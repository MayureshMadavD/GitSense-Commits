# Activity Summary for 07/07/2025

## 12:29:45
The log shows two entries for `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`, both on July 7th, 2025.  The changes between the two entries are minimal, suggesting a possible accidental double-save or a very minor edit that did not alter the core functionality.  The file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API, experiment, Twidpay, KP, CDN) based on the current environment (`env`).  The `env` variable can take values like `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`, and others, each mapping to a different URL.  There's a significant amount of conditional logic to handle different environments and to provide fallback URLs. The `setCart` function initializes a cart object with specific data, this is only called when `env` is set to 'local'.  The file also defines functions to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which also vary according to the environment.  The timestamps of the edits (12:25:58 and 12:28:55) indicate that the changes were made within a short time span.  The code exhibits a common pattern of conditional URL switching based on the environment, ensuring that the correct API endpoints are used in different development and deployment stages.

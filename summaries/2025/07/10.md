# Activity Summary for 10/07/2025

## 00:13:47
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/offers-discount/index.tsx` file was updated twice on 09/07/2025, with a minor difference between the two versions.  The primary change between the two commits is a very minor correction in the `updateDiscount` function.  Specifically, a backslash was replaced with a forward slash in a conditional statement handling `discount?.additional_details?.bullet_points`.  The rest of the code remains consistent between the two versions.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying and managing offers and discounts. It fetches data using `makeAPICall`, interacts with a merchant configuration API (`useMerchantConfigApi`), and renders a table of discount codes. The component allows for creating, editing, deleting, and reordering discount codes.  The UI includes features such as filtering, pagination, and a switch to toggle "Offers Fixed Position".  The component also leverages React Redux for accessing user configuration (`getUserConfig`).  There are functions for updating single discounts (`updateDiscount`), updating all discounts (`updateAllDiscountCodes`) and handling their sorting.  The code uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.  The timestamp of both changes are very close, indicating a quick edit and save.

# Activity Summary for 10/07/2025

## 00:13:47
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/offers-discount/index.tsx` file was updated twice on 09/07/2025, with a minor difference between the two versions.  The primary change between the two commits is a very minor correction in the `updateDiscount` function.  Specifically, a backslash was replaced with a forward slash in a conditional statement handling `discount?.additional_details?.bullet_points`.  The rest of the code remains consistent between the two versions.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying and managing offers and discounts. It fetches data using `makeAPICall`, interacts with a merchant configuration API (`useMerchantConfigApi`), and renders a table of discount codes. The component allows for creating, editing, deleting, and reordering discount codes.  The UI includes features such as filtering, pagination, and a switch to toggle "Offers Fixed Position".  The component also leverages React Redux for accessing user configuration (`getUserConfig`).  There are functions for updating single discounts (`updateDiscount`), updating all discounts (`updateAllDiscountCodes`) and handling their sorting.  The code uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.  The timestamp of both changes are very close, indicating a quick edit and save.

The log shows code changes on October 7th, 2025, primarily focused on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, specifically configuring an import map for a single-spa application.

The key changes involve updating the import map URLs based on the `deployedEnv` variable.  This variable determines which environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production) the application is running in and loads corresponding URLs for various modules (@gokwik/*).  The local environment uses a mix of localhost and other URLs, while dev, qa, and sandbox environments use distinct URLs for each module.  The production environment additionally includes Clarity.ms and New Relic monitoring scripts. The inclusion of  `<script type="systemjs-importmap">`  indicates the use of SystemJS for module loading.

The timestamps show that the `.env` file, containing environment variables for base URLs and bulk discount URLs, was modified at 13:03:54, slightly before the `index.ejs` file at 13:04:12.  This suggests that the environment variables might influence the URLs used in the `index.ejs` file's import map, though the exact relationship isn't explicitly shown in the log. The addition of `@gokwik/kwikcomm` in the `dev` and `qa` environments suggests a new module was introduced or enabled in those environments.  The production environment includes scripts for performance monitoring (New Relic) and user experience monitoring (Clarity.ms), indicating a shift towards production-level configuration.  No changes are detailed for other files.

The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` files between 13:13:16 and 13:36:16 on October 7, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent several revisions.  The core functionality remains consistent:  it defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestions, APIs, etc.) based on the current environment (`env`).  The `env` variable is subscribed to changes in the `store_environment` from `LoginStore`.  Significant changes include modifications to the `api_url` function, adding or changing URLs for different environments ('local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and others).  The `setCart` function was also modified, showing different cart data with different tokens in subsequent commits. The changes in `api_url` suggest ongoing development and testing across multiple environments.  The commented-out lines in `api_url` hint at experimentation with different API endpoints for the 'local' environment.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` shows updates primarily in the `window.merchantInfo` object within the embedded `<script>` tags. This object, which seems to be used for communication with the GoKwik SDK, shows changes to the `mid` (merchant ID) value across different commits.  This strongly suggests testing with various merchant IDs, potentially for different GoKwik environments or clients. The commented out script tag `// let gokwikScript = document.createElement("script");` suggests testing with different versions of the GoKwik Javascript SDK or exploring various loading methods.  The inclusion and persistence of cookie setting code for `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` indicates a focus on tracking user behavior and potentially analytics.

The log shows multiple edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/global.css`.  The file primarily contains CSS code defining fonts, body styles, button styles, image handling, and numerous classes seemingly for styling bank icons (`.nb-andhra`, `.nb-boi`, etc.) and other UI elements using sprite icons (`.sprite-back-icon`, `.sprite-cross-icon`, etc.).

The first three entries (timestamps 15:49:32, 15:50:02, and 15:54:18) are identical.  The code defines several font families ('Inter' and 'metropolis' variants) and sets general styles for HTML elements and other styling elements.  These identical commits could represent accidental repeated saves or a failed initial commit attempt.

A significant change occurred at 15:57:55.  This revision added the 'Inconsolata' font family definition to the CSS file and switched the default body font from 'Inter' to 'metropolisregular'.  There is another nearly identical commit at 15:58:05 which shows little to no code difference, implying another accidental save.


The repeated identical commits suggest potential workflow issues during the development process.  The most substantial update involved the introduction of the 'Inconsolata' font and the alteration of the default body font family.

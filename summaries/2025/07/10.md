# Activity Summary for 10/07/2025

## 00:13:47
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/offers-discount/index.tsx` file was updated twice on 09/07/2025, with a minor difference between the two versions.  The primary change between the two commits is a very minor correction in the `updateDiscount` function.  Specifically, a backslash was replaced with a forward slash in a conditional statement handling `discount?.additional_details?.bullet_points`.  The rest of the code remains consistent between the two versions.  The file is a React component responsible for displaying and managing offers and discounts. It fetches data using `makeAPICall`, interacts with a merchant configuration API (`useMerchantConfigApi`), and renders a table of discount codes. The component allows for creating, editing, deleting, and reordering discount codes.  The UI includes features such as filtering, pagination, and a switch to toggle "Offers Fixed Position".  The component also leverages React Redux for accessing user configuration (`getUserConfig`).  There are functions for updating single discounts (`updateDiscount`), updating all discounts (`updateAllDiscountCodes`) and handling their sorting.  The code uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library for UI elements.  The timestamp of both changes are very close, indicating a quick edit and save.

The log shows code changes on October 7th, 2025, primarily focused on the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates HTML, specifically configuring an import map for a single-spa application.

The key changes involve updating the import map URLs based on the `deployedEnv` variable.  This variable determines which environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production) the application is running in and loads corresponding URLs for various modules (@gokwik/*).  The local environment uses a mix of localhost and other URLs, while dev, qa, and sandbox environments use distinct URLs for each module.  The production environment additionally includes Clarity.ms and New Relic monitoring scripts. The inclusion of  `<script type="systemjs-importmap">`  indicates the use of SystemJS for module loading.

The timestamps show that the `.env` file, containing environment variables for base URLs and bulk discount URLs, was modified at 13:03:54, slightly before the `index.ejs` file at 13:04:12.  This suggests that the environment variables might influence the URLs used in the `index.ejs` file's import map, though the exact relationship isn't explicitly shown in the log. The addition of `@gokwik/kwikcomm` in the `dev` and `qa` environments suggests a new module was introduced or enabled in those environments.  The production environment includes scripts for performance monitoring (New Relic) and user experience monitoring (Clarity.ms), indicating a shift towards production-level configuration.  No changes are detailed for other files.

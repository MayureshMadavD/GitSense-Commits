# Activity Summary for 01/07/2025

## 13:02:42
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/tax-settings/globalTaxConfig.tsx` between 12:24 PM and 1:02 PM on January 7, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the handling of tax rates within a form.

The initial version (12:24 PM) included a form for setting global tax configurations.  Subsequent changes (12:26 PM, 12:27 PM, 12:28 PM, 12:30 PM, 12:33 PM, 12:35 PM, 12:39 PM, 12:40 PM, 12:42 PM, 12:42 PM, 12:47 PM, 12:47 PM, 12:48 PM, 12:48 PM) involved adjustments to the `inputNumber` component's `precision` property, fluctuating between 0, 3, and 2, likely to control the number of decimal places displayed and accepted for tax rates.  There were also a few minor formatting changes.

A significant change occurred at 12:48 PM, where the `onFinish` function was modified to log form values instead of immediately sending data for saving. This suggests a debugging phase.

At 12:55 PM and 12:56 PM, the `tax_rate` within the `taxDetailsList` was modified to include a `toFixed(2)` or `toFixed(5)` method in the `onFinish` handler, to control decimal points  before sending to the API. The `toFixed(2)` was reverted. Finally at 13:01 PM and 13:02 PM the `tax_rate` was changed to use `Math.round` instead of  `toFixed`, indicating a final decision to store tax rates as integers in the backend.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/websiteAnalytics.tsx` file was updated only once (11:04:25 AM on January 7, 2025).  This update involved adding a comprehensive React component for displaying website analytics, including key metrics, line graphs, and funnel charts. The component incorporates various UI elements and interacts with Redux to fetch and display data.  A notable feature is the conditional rendering based on KwikPass integration status, displaying a warning message and app installation prompt if not integrated.

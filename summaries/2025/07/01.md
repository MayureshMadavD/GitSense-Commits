# Activity Summary for 01/07/2025

## 13:02:42
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/tax-settings/globalTaxConfig.tsx` between 12:24 PM and 1:02 PM on January 7, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the handling of tax rates within a form.

The initial version (12:24 PM) included a form for setting global tax configurations.  Subsequent changes (12:26 PM, 12:27 PM, 12:28 PM, 12:30 PM, 12:33 PM, 12:35 PM, 12:39 PM, 12:40 PM, 12:42 PM, 12:42 PM, 12:47 PM, 12:47 PM, 12:48 PM, 12:48 PM) involved adjustments to the `inputNumber` component's `precision` property, fluctuating between 0, 3, and 2, likely to control the number of decimal places displayed and accepted for tax rates.  There were also a few minor formatting changes.

A significant change occurred at 12:48 PM, where the `onFinish` function was modified to log form values instead of immediately sending data for saving. This suggests a debugging phase.

At 12:55 PM and 12:56 PM, the `tax_rate` within the `taxDetailsList` was modified to include a `toFixed(2)` or `toFixed(5)` method in the `onFinish` handler, to control decimal points  before sending to the API. The `toFixed(2)` was reverted. Finally at 13:01 PM and 13:02 PM the `tax_rate` was changed to use `Math.round` instead of  `toFixed`, indicating a final decision to store tax rates as integers in the backend.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/analytics/websiteAnalytics.tsx` file was updated only once (11:04:25 AM on January 7, 2025).  This update involved adding a comprehensive React component for displaying website analytics, including key metrics, line graphs, and funnel charts. The component incorporates various UI elements and interacts with Redux to fetch and display data.  A notable feature is the conditional rendering based on KwikPass integration status, displaying a warning message and app installation prompt if not integrated.


## 14:02:42
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/tax-settings/globalTaxConfig.tsx` and one revision to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/renderFormItem.tsx`.  The `globalTaxConfig.tsx` file underwent several iterations between 13:21:55 and 13:35:19 on January 7, 2025.  These changes primarily focused on the handling of tax rates within a form.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/tax-settings/globalTaxConfig.tsx` Changes:**

* **Initial Version (13:21:55):**  This version established the basic structure of a tax settings component, fetching tax details, rendering them in a table using `RenderField` components, and including "Save" and "Reset to default tax rates" buttons.  The tax rate was handled with toFixed(4)  in both get and post requests.

* **Subsequent Revisions (13:23:14, 13:25:51):** Minor adjustments were made to the code, primarily in how `tax_rate` was handled within the `onFinish` function.  The `toFixed(4)` was inconsistently applied or removed from  `tax_rate` handling in these versions.

* **Revision (13:28:33):** A `console.log` statement was added to the `onFinish` function to log the tax details before submission. The API call for saving settings was commented out.

* **Revision (13:29:13):** A very minor change. The `toFixed` function was removed completely in the `onFinish` function.


* **Revision (13:31:07):** The `tax_rate` handling in the `onFinish` function was changed to use `Math.round(tax_rate * 10000) / 10000` for more precise rounding. The API call for saving settings was still commented out.

* **Final Version (13:35:19):** The `console.log` statement was removed, and the commented-out API call within `onFinish` function was reactivated. The code now saves the tax settings after form submission.


**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/renderFormItem.tsx` Changes:**

* **Single Revision (13:27:36):** This file, responsible for rendering various form items, was updated.  The changes include improved handling of labels with descriptions, the addition of an info component,  and better support for different form field types (switch, info, divider, draggable, chip).  This component seems to have been improved to support more features and better formatting.

**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

The `globalTaxConfig.tsx` file consistently interacts with an API endpoint (`APIEndPoints.getTaxDetails`) to fetch and save tax details.  The use of the `gokwik-ui-kit` library is evident throughout.  The code also demonstrates a pattern of managing form data using React's `Form` component and `useCallback` and `useEffect` hooks for efficient data fetching and updates.  There's a strong focus on data validation and user feedback (using `message.success`). The changes show an iterative development process, with minor adjustments and bug fixes made in quick succession.


## 15:02:48
The log shows multiple revisions to Svelte components and TypeScript interface files related to a Gokwik checkout UI.  Significant changes occurred between 14:08:55 and 14:35:24 on January 7, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte`: This file underwent several revisions.  Key changes involve:

* **Removal of `getGkCookieArray` import:** The `getGkCookieArray` function was removed from the `./services/Helper.service` import statement, simplifying imports.
* **Addition of `kwikpass_user_token` variable:** A `kwikpass_user_token` variable was added to handle Kwikpass user tokens, suggesting integration with Kwikpass authentication.  This variable was initially declared as `stringify` which was later corrected to `string`.
* **Consistent updates to data handling:**  Multiple revisions focused on consistently passing data (like `cartObject`, `merchantInfo`, various analytics parameters etc.) to the iFrame, indicating improvements in data flow and communication between the parent component and the iFrame.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Interfaces.ts`: This file also saw several updates, primarily refining the `LaunchData` interface.  The most notable change is the removal of the `jwtTokensArray` property from the `LaunchData` interface, suggesting a shift in how JWT tokens are handled.  The `LaunchData` interface consistently reflects the data passed to the iframe, maintaining consistency with `Merchant.svelte`.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/iFrameComponent.svelte`:  This component was repeatedly modified to align with the changes in the `LaunchData` interface, particularly removing `jwtTokensArray` from the `postMessage` data. The `src` attribute of the iframe tag was modified from `getPath(environment)` to `${merchantInfo.showSingleUi ? getSingleUiPath(environment) : getPath(environment)}/index.html`, introducing a `showSingleUi` flag which suggests an alternative UI mode.  Error handling was improved with the addition of `triggerEventCall` for failed `postMessage` attempts.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts`: This file saw the addition of several new writable stores, expanding the application's state management.  The addition of `store_additionalAddress`, `store_paymentMethodsOrder`, `store_loadingFlag`, `store_earnedLoyaltyDetails`, and `store_isCartUpdated` suggest additional features related to address management, payment method ordering, loading states, and loyalty programs.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ForeignAnalytics.ts`: This file contains analytics event tracking code.  It consistently updates its data sources from the various Svelte stores and reflects the addition of Kwikpass user token and the evolution of data passed between components.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte`: This main application component changed to incorporate the new stores and functionality. There is a notable improvement in error handling and state management.  The handling of the `isHydrogen` flag highlights the integration with Shopify's Hydrogen framework.  The addition of event listeners for message passing between the main app and its iframe further clarifies the architecture of this component.



In summary, the code changes reflect a significant refactoring effort aimed at improving data management, error handling, and adding features, particularly Kwikpass integration and a new single UI mode.  The frequent updates to the `LaunchData` interface and the `postMessage` data in the iFrame component highlight a strong focus on ensuring consistent data flow between the parent component and the iFrame. The addition of several new stores in `CommonStore.ts` indicates expansion of features and state management within the application.


## 16:02:36
The provided log shows two commits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`, a React component for a rich text editor.  Both commits occurred on January 7th, 2025, within a short time frame (15:52:46 and 15:57:11).

The changes between the two commits are minimal. The only significant difference lies within the `addTargetBlankToAnchors` function.  In the first commit, the line setting the style for bold text is `bold.setAttribute('style', 'font-family: "metropolisbold";')`, while in the second commit, it's changed to `bold.setAttribute('style', 'font-family:metropolisbold')`. This is a minor change removing the extra space within the style string.  The rest of the code remains identical.  The component itself is a rich text editor with functionality for bold, italic, underline, and link insertion, along with character limits and styling.  It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements.


## 17:02:36
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/global.css` file was updated on 01/07/2025 at 16:59:32.  The update involved defining various font faces ('metropolislight', 'metropolisregular', 'metropolismedium', 'metropolisbold', and 'Inconsolata'),  setting default styles for HTML elements (body, button, input, etc.), and defining numerous CSS classes (`globalImg`, `payIcon`,  various `nb-*` classes representing bank icons, and several `sprite-*` classes for icons, based on background-position within sprite sheets).  The `nb-*` classes appear to be for styling bank logos,  using background-position to specify which part of a sprite image to display for each bank.  The `sprite-*` classes similarly use background-position within a sprite sheet to display different icons.  The update includes styling to improve button and input appearance, and to handle autofill styles.


## 18:45:50
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` was updated on 01/07/2025 at 17:45:52.  This React component, `RichTextEditor`, is a rich text editor with formatting options (bold, italic, underline, link).  Key features include:

* **Formatting:**  Uses `document.execCommand` for bold, italic, and underline.  Link creation opens a modal for URL input.
* **Link Handling:** Adds `target="_blank"` to all `<a>` tags and custom styling to bold tags (`font-semibold`) to ensure links open in a new tab and have consistent bold styling.
* **Character Limit:** Limits input to 64 characters, displaying a character counter.  If the text exceeds the limit, it trims the input.
* **Paste Handling:**  Extracts formatted text (bold, italic, underline) from pasted content and updates the component's state accordingly.
* **Line Breaks:** Handles `Enter` key presses to insert line breaks (`insertLineBreak`).
* **UI Framework:** Leverages `gokwik-ui-kit` components (Tooltip, Button, icons, Input, message, Popover).  The UI consists of a toolbar with formatting buttons and a content editable div.
* **State Management:** Uses `useState` hooks to manage modal visibility, selected range, URL input, and text count.  `useRef` is used to persist the initial value.
* **Custom Functionalities:**  Includes functions like `addTargetBlankToAnchors` for post-processing HTML and `extractMatchFromString` for extracting formatted text content from HTML strings.  These functions handle the extraction of bold, italic, and underlined content from HTML, converting them to plain text and updating the character count.


The update appears to be a comprehensive revision of the rich text editor, focusing on improved functionality, better handling of HTML content, and enhanced user experience.


## 20:58:55
The provided log shows two entries for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`.  Both entries contain identical code. The timestamps indicate the file was modified at 20:40:04 and then again at 20:40:10,  a difference of only 6 seconds.  This suggests a very minor, likely inconsequential change between the two commits (perhaps just a save operation).  

The code itself defines a React component `RichTextEditor` which is a rich text editor with functionalities for bold, italic, underline, link creation, and character limits.  It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements.  The component handles input changes, text formatting, link insertion, and pasting, limiting the input text to 64 characters. The `extractMatchFromString` function parses HTML to extract formatted text content.  The 6-second interval between identical code entries raises questions about the commit process and might indicate a redundant commit.


## 20:58:57
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` on January 7th, 2025 between 20:14:40 and 20:24:34.  The code in this file is a Svelte component responsible for displaying an order summary.  No changes are apparent in the content across these revisions. The component heavily utilizes Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state, including cart information, discounts, payment methods, and user data. It dynamically calculates the `totalPrice` based on various factors like discounts, shipping, and COD charges.  The component also includes functionality for toggling the order summary drawer, updating the cart, handling free gifts, and triggering analytics events (GTM and GA4).

A separate change was made to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/global.css` at 20:41:19. This file defines global styles for the application, including font definitions for 'metropolislight', 'metropolisregular', 'metropolismedium', 'metropolisbold', and 'Inconsolata' fonts.  It also sets default styles for HTML elements like `body`, `button`, and `img`, and includes styles for various CSS classes, many of which appear to be related to icons (`globalImg`, `.payIcon`, various `.nb-...` classes for bank icons, and sprite icons like `.sprite-back-icon`).  The CSS also contains rules to style autofill input fields and prevent visible autofill indicators.


## 22:58:56
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx`, a React component for a rich text editor.  The main changes revolve around the `addTargetBlankToAnchors` function and some event handlers.

The first revision (22:27:56) establishes the base functionality of the rich text editor, including bold, italic, underline, and link functionalities.  It also implements character count limits and handles pasting text.

Subsequent revisions (22:47:56, 22:51:31, 22:53:44) focus on the `addTargetBlankToAnchors` function.  Initially, this function uses a `div` element to manipulate HTML.  There's experimentation with changing the element type to `span` and applying flexbox styles (22:51:31), but this change is reverted (22:53:44) to the original `div` usage. The return type of `addTargetBlankToAnchors` changed from a string to a node and then back to a string.

The `handleKeyDown` event handler, initially included to prevent default enter behavior, was commented out at 22:47:56 and  uncommented at 22:54:40.  This suggests a possible debugging or feature toggling process.  The overall functionality of the component remained largely unchanged across revisions, with the primary focus being on refining the HTML manipulation within `addTargetBlankToAnchors`.  The final version (22:54:40) is functionally similar to the initial one but with the corrected `addTargetBlankToAnchors` implementation and the `handleKeyDown` function uncommented.


## 23:58:59
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` between 23:12:02 and 23:55:44 on January 7, 2025.  The main focus of these changes is improving the `createDynamicHTML` function and handling of `<br>` tags within the rich text editor.

Initially, `createDynamicHTML` centered text regardless of the number of lines.  Subsequent revisions made the alignment dynamic, centering only when multiple lines are present; otherwise, left alignment is used.  This involved changes to how line breaks (`<br>`) and `<div>` tags are handled within the function's logic.

Several commits refined the `sanitizeHtmlBrs` function, aiming to prevent unwanted `<br>` tags from appearing between inline HTML tags (e.g., `<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`). The final version of `sanitizeHtmlBrs` uses three regular expressions to address different scenarios where extra `<br>` tags might be inserted.  The earlier versions of this function attempted to solve this in a single pass, but the final version employs a more robust, multi-step approach.

The `extractMatchFromString` function, which extracts various formatting elements from the HTML, remained largely consistent, adapting to the changes in HTML structure produced by `createDynamicHTML` and `sanitizeHtmlBrs`.  The `handleKeyDown` function also underwent revisions to improve how line breaks are inserted, initially using `document.execCommand('insertLineBreak')`, then switching to `document.execCommand('insertHTML', false, '<br>')` to ensure consistency and allow for better control.  A `setTimeout` was added to trigger an `input` event after inserting a line break for more accurate updates.

The `MobileStepUI` component in `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx`, updated at 23:27:42, shows a UI for managing various checkout settings.  This component doesn't appear to be directly related to the rich text editor changes.  It uses various UI components from `gokwik-ui-kit` to render tabs and display settings related to branding, login, payments, addresses, coupons, and checkout elements.  The coupon section dynamically renders a list of available coupons based on the `couponsData` prop.

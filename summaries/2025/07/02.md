# Activity Summary for 02/07/2025

## 08:39:15
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/OfferBanner.svelte` file between 00:29:17 and 00:34:46 on February 7th, 2025.  The file is an Svelte component rendering an offer banner.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions:  the component fetches configuration data (`reqIdObject`), determines which banner to display based on the current page (`$store_page`), and renders the banner using the retrieved configuration.  The banner's appearance (background color, text color, content) is dynamically determined.

The primary changes observed are within the `<style>` section.  Specifically:

* **00:29:17:** Initial commit with `background` style property using a linear gradient.
* **00:31:44:** Addition of `white-space: pre-line;` to the `.offer-strip` class, likely to preserve whitespace in the banner content.
* **00:34:32:**  The `background` style property is changed to `background-color`, and the padding is reduced from 5px to 4px.
* **00:34:46:** No changes from the previous revision.


The `<script>` section remains largely unchanged, suggesting that the core logic for fetching and displaying the banner was not altered. The minor updates within the styling likely reflect refinements to the banner's visual presentation.


## 08:39:16
The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx`.

The `richtexteditor.tsx` file underwent extensive modifications between 00:03:41 and 00:20:48.  These changes primarily focused on refining the Rich Text Editor component.  Specifically, the `extractMatchFromString` function was repeatedly adjusted, likely to improve its HTML parsing and text extraction capabilities.  The changes involved modifications to regular expressions used for matching italic, bold, and underline tags, and also simplification of the HTML string cleaning process. The `handleInputChange` function also saw significant changes, primarily to handle input changes and update the editor's content more effectively.  The addition of `console.log(result.htmlString)` in one revision suggests debugging efforts.  Finally, minor UI tweaks, such as button styling, were also introduced.

The `mobile.tsx` file was modified twice, at 00:07:20 and 00:21:51. These changes involved enhancements to a UI component displaying settings related to mobile view. The updates included improving the display of coupon information, enhancing the preview section, and adjusting the styling of various UI elements. A notable change was the addition of `whitespace-pre-line` to a `<p>` tag within the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` section, improving the handling of whitespace in the banner content.  There were also no functional changes to the code, simply modifications to the visual layout and styling.


## 11:46:42
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` file between 11:28:00 and 11:30:21 on February 7th, 2025.  The code remains virtually identical across all revisions.  The changes appear to be insignificant, possibly due to automatic formatting, version control operations, or minor edits not reflected in the provided code snippets.  There is no substantial functional difference across the revisions.  The file is a Svelte component responsible for rendering an order summary, utilizing numerous Svelte stores for managing state and interacting with other parts of the application. The component dynamically calculates the total price, handles cart updates, displays free gifts, and incorporates various discount mechanisms.  The repeated nature of the code suggests no meaningful alterations were made.


## 12:46:44
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` on February 7th, 2025.  The main focus of the changes appears to be refining the handling of cookies and  merchant information, particularly in the `setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad` and `launchApp` functions.

The first revision (11:54:45) is a substantial initial version of the code,  importing numerous modules related to analytics (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics), handling various payment methods (UPI), and managing cookies and local storage.  It includes extensive functions for setting, getting, and deleting cookies, along with logic for handling different environments (local, dev, production, etc.) and  various query parameters.  The `truecallerConfig` object contains API keys for different environments, although these are not included in the summary to protect sensitive data.


Subsequent revisions (12:26:44, 12:28:59, 12:29:36, 12:29:44, 12:29:53) show incremental changes.  The most significant alteration is the addition of `sessionIDFixMerchants` array (around 12:28:59) and modification of `setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad` to conditionally set `shopifySessionId` based on whether `window.merchantInfo.mid` is present in that array.  This suggests a bug fix or feature related to Shopify session IDs for specific merchants. A new `getKpParamForFb` function was also introduced to fetch a Facebook click ID from the URL.  There are also minor changes to variable declarations and function parameters throughout the revisions, suggesting ongoing refinement and debugging.  The `XGokwikToken` import is removed between the first and second revision, suggesting a refactor of how tokens are handled.  The code consistently uses cookies and localStorage to store various pieces of data, indicating a reliance on client-side storage.


## 16:46:41
The log shows multiple revisions to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Facebook.ts` file between 16:21:22 and 16:37:20 on February 7, 2025.  The changes primarily involve debugging and logging within the `facebookAnalyticsEvent` function.  Specifically, `console.log` statements were added and removed to inspect the values of `data.data.fbc`, `data.data.kmp`, and `data.data.kpmclid` at various points. There were also some minor changes in optional chaining syntax (`data.data.fbc` changed to `data?.data?.fbc` in some revisions) but no significant functional changes to the core logic of the Facebook analytics tracking.  The `Merchant.svelte` file was updated at 16:27:20, indicating the integration of the Facebook analytics function (`callFacebook`) into a larger Svelte component responsible for merchant checkout UI.  This file shows extensive setup for various analytics platforms (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, etc.), suggesting a comprehensive analytics tracking system in place for the application.


## 17:46:41
The log shows two entries for `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Analytics/Facebook.ts`, both on February 7th, 2025, with a difference of only 15 seconds between them.  The code in both entries is identical.  The file contains Javascript code for sending analytics events to Facebook.  The code uses the `fbq` function to track events, handling both standard and custom events.  It extracts information from the `data` object to construct the payload including user info, product details and event specific parameters. There is also a function `initPageViewEvt` that appears to fire a page view event to Facebook, conditionally depending on the origin of the window and whether the event is a custom event. The code includes commented-out code for a `randomString` function and uses an `alphaNumeric` function to generate random strings for tracking purposes.  The minimal time difference between the two entries suggests a possible accidental double-save or a very minor, undetected change.

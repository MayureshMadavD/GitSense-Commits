# Activity Summary for 02/07/2025

## 08:39:15
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/OfferBanner.svelte` file between 00:29:17 and 00:34:46 on February 7th, 2025.  The file is an Svelte component rendering an offer banner.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions:  the component fetches configuration data (`reqIdObject`), determines which banner to display based on the current page (`$store_page`), and renders the banner using the retrieved configuration.  The banner's appearance (background color, text color, content) is dynamically determined.

The primary changes observed are within the `<style>` section.  Specifically:

* **00:29:17:** Initial commit with `background` style property using a linear gradient.
* **00:31:44:** Addition of `white-space: pre-line;` to the `.offer-strip` class, likely to preserve whitespace in the banner content.
* **00:34:32:**  The `background` style property is changed to `background-color`, and the padding is reduced from 5px to 4px.
* **00:34:46:** No changes from the previous revision.


The `<script>` section remains largely unchanged, suggesting that the core logic for fetching and displaying the banner was not altered. The minor updates within the styling likely reflect refinements to the banner's visual presentation.

The log shows multiple revisions to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/richtexteditor.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx`.

The `richtexteditor.tsx` file underwent extensive modifications between 00:03:41 and 00:20:48.  These changes primarily focused on refining the Rich Text Editor component.  Specifically, the `extractMatchFromString` function was repeatedly adjusted, likely to improve its HTML parsing and text extraction capabilities.  The changes involved modifications to regular expressions used for matching italic, bold, and underline tags, and also simplification of the HTML string cleaning process. The `handleInputChange` function also saw significant changes, primarily to handle input changes and update the editor's content more effectively.  The addition of `console.log(result.htmlString)` in one revision suggests debugging efforts.  Finally, minor UI tweaks, such as button styling, were also introduced.

The `mobile.tsx` file was modified twice, at 00:07:20 and 00:21:51. These changes involved enhancements to a UI component displaying settings related to mobile view. The updates included improving the display of coupon information, enhancing the preview section, and adjusting the styling of various UI elements. A notable change was the addition of `whitespace-pre-line` to a `<p>` tag within the `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` section, improving the handling of whitespace in the banner content.  There were also no functional changes to the code, simply modifications to the visual layout and styling.


## 11:46:42
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` file between 11:28:00 and 11:30:21 on February 7th, 2025.  The code remains virtually identical across all revisions.  The changes appear to be insignificant, possibly due to automatic formatting, version control operations, or minor edits not reflected in the provided code snippets.  There is no substantial functional difference across the revisions.  The file is a Svelte component responsible for rendering an order summary, utilizing numerous Svelte stores for managing state and interacting with other parts of the application. The component dynamically calculates the total price, handles cart updates, displays free gifts, and incorporates various discount mechanisms.  The repeated nature of the code suggests no meaningful alterations were made.

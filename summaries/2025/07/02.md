# Activity Summary for 02/07/2025

## 08:39:15
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/OfferBanner.svelte` file between 00:29:17 and 00:34:46 on February 7th, 2025.  The file is an Svelte component rendering an offer banner.

The core functionality remains consistent across all revisions:  the component fetches configuration data (`reqIdObject`), determines which banner to display based on the current page (`$store_page`), and renders the banner using the retrieved configuration.  The banner's appearance (background color, text color, content) is dynamically determined.

The primary changes observed are within the `<style>` section.  Specifically:

* **00:29:17:** Initial commit with `background` style property using a linear gradient.
* **00:31:44:** Addition of `white-space: pre-line;` to the `.offer-strip` class, likely to preserve whitespace in the banner content.
* **00:34:32:**  The `background` style property is changed to `background-color`, and the padding is reduced from 5px to 4px.
* **00:34:46:** No changes from the previous revision.


The `<script>` section remains largely unchanged, suggesting that the core logic for fetching and displaying the banner was not altered. The minor updates within the styling likely reflect refinements to the banner's visual presentation.

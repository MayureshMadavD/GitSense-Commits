# Activity Summary for 04/07/2025

## 11:47:14
The log shows several code modifications across multiple files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory on April 7th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the checkout configuration dashboard and adding features related to UTM discounts and tax settings.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/index.tsx`: This file, updated at 10:50:47 and 11:11:09,  manages the UI for checkout configurations. The updates likely involve adding or refining the display of various discount configuration options.  The component renders several sub-components (`CodLimits`, `BlockDiscountCodes`, `DiscountCodes`, etc.), each likely representing a different aspect of checkout configuration.  The later update likely involved minor UI or structural adjustments.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx`: Updated at 10:50:57 and 11:28:29, this file is the main settings page component.  Significant changes involve the addition of new settings sections ('Automatic Free Gift', 'Agent Led Settings'), and possibly updates to the menu structure to reflect the new additions.  The code also implements polling for agreement status and the rendering of an agreement signing banner. The structure of the settings menu is heavily modified based on the user's configuration and permissions (`config`, `isMerchantUser`).

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/searchProducts.tsx`:  This file, modified at 10:56:25, is a reusable component for searching and selecting products.  The component uses a modal for the product selection and allows incrementing/decrementing quantities. It incorporates debouncing for efficient search updates.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/utmDiscount.tsx`:  This file underwent multiple updates (11:01:00, 11:01:29, 11:05:54, 11:10:48) demonstrating iterative development of the UTM discounting section. The modifications focused primarily on refining the UTM discount configuration UI, adding input validation (checking for duplicate UTM parameters and ensuring required fields are filled), and improving error handling (using `message.error`). A key functional change includes the addition of a switch to enable or disable auto-application of discounts. The final changes seem to be around minor bug fixes and code cleanup (like removing unnecessary checks).


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/tax-settings/taxOverride.tsx`: Updated at 11:42:57 and 11:44:45, this component handles tax overrides. The changes are related to the UI for adding and managing tax overrides, which are likely to be product or shipping related. A debounce function is used for efficient collection searching.  The minor update at 11:44:45 likely fixes a logging issue within the collection fetching logic.


In summary, the code changes reflect a focused effort on enhancing the checkout configuration dashboard with a new UTM discount feature, improving the user interface, adding error handling and validation, and developing a component for handling tax overrides.  The multiple edits to `utmDiscount.tsx` suggest an iterative development process with bug fixes and refinements.  The overall pattern shows a consistent use of React and related libraries (`gokwik-ui-kit`, `react-redux`) to build a dynamic and user-friendly interface for merchant settings.


## 12:47:12
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/tax-settings/taxOverride.tsx` on April 7th, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing tax overrides.  The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions, but several changes were made to the `fetchCollections` function which handles fetching and updating the list of Shopify collections.

Initial versions (11:48:18, 11:49:21, 11:49:55) of `fetchCollections` contained a bug where it incorrectly handled the `collection` response from the API, sometimes failing to update the `collections` state correctly.

Subsequent updates (12:02:23, 12:10:31, 12:12:25, 12:15:38, 12:16:42, 12:19:37, 12:20:20, 12:20:36, 12:25:08, 12:25:58) addressed this bug. The primary fix involved ensuring the `collection` variable was consistently treated as an array, either by explicitly checking if it was an array and handling the non-array case or making sure to always return an array in the case of non array responses, thus making the collection handling robust in `fetchCollections` function.  A `console.log` statement was also added for debugging purposes (12:12:25, then removed) and then removed later.  There was also a minor change in how collection labels are extracted in the `collectionList` variable, opting to use the `item.label` property at the end. The final revisions ensure that even when the API returns a single collection object rather than an array, it is handled correctly preventing any error and making the code cleaner and more robust.  All other aspects of the component, including the form handling, data display, and error messages, remained unchanged.  The frequent updates between 12:02:23 and 12:25:58 indicate iterative debugging and refinement of the collection fetching logic.


## 13:47:12
The log shows code changes across three files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` directory between 12:47 PM and 13:08 PM on April 7, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated at 12:47:50 PM. This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestion, etc.) based on the current environment (`env`).  The `env` variable is dynamically determined and numerous URLs are defined for different environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.).  The code also includes functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) depending on the environment.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with substantial data, including item details.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 12:48:33 PM. This file is an HTML page that appears to be a merchant interface.  It includes a button triggering a `goKwikCheckout` function which sends `merchantInfo` data via a `postMessage` call.  The `merchantInfo` object contains various merchant details including a merchant ID (`mid`), app ID, app secret, and environment settings. The script also sets cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`). The page includes commented-out code suggesting earlier implementations or alternative approaches.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` was updated twice, at 13:07:51 PM and 13:08:08 PM. These updates to this file show numerous asynchronous functions (`getCartJs`, `getRequestId`, `getUserExperiments`, etc.) for interacting with various merchant APIs.  These functions handle cart retrieval, request ID generation, user experiment retrieval, address management, OTP verification, and more.  The code heavily uses `x-gokwik-token` and `x-gokwik-initiator` headers in API calls.  The code manages many store subscriptions using Svelte's `subscribe` method, indicating reactive state management.  There is a queue mechanism (`apiRequestProcessingQueue`) for managing asynchronous API calls.  The code also includes significant logic to handle different custom configurations and pixels (`bikCustomerId`, `cf_user_customer_id`, etc.).  The two updates appear to be minor revisions, possibly bug fixes or very small feature changes as the core functionality remains consistent between the two timestamps.  The second update at 13:08:08 PM shows no significant change compared to the version at 13:07:51 PM.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` was updated at 13:08:41 PM. This Svelte component handles discount application logic.  It interacts with multiple stores to manage discounts, coupons, gift cards, and credits.  It uses several services (`discountCall`, `applyCredOffer`, `callBestDiscountOffer`, etc.) to apply and manage discounts.  The component dynamically updates the UI based on various states and settings, such as the availability of different discount types and whether specific discount combinations are allowed. The component manages a significant number of variables relating to discount calculation, application, and display.


## 18:47:08
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` file between 17:54:42 and 18:03:13 on April 7th, 2025.  The changes are minor and seem focused on refining the `editAbcCart` component's state management.  Specifically,  there's a change in the initial value of the `cod` field within the `state` variable from `true` to `false` between 17:54:42 and 17:56:27.  The code itself remains largely the same across all revisions, suggesting iterative debugging or minor adjustments to the component's logic. The core functionality, which involves fetching customer details, creating/fetching addresses, and creating orders using API calls (`makeAPICall`), remains consistent. The component heavily relies on asynchronous operations and error handling using `try...catch` blocks.  No significant structural changes to the component are observed.

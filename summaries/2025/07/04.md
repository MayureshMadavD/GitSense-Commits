# Activity Summary for 04/07/2025

## 11:47:14
The log shows several code modifications across multiple files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory on April 7th, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on enhancing the checkout configuration dashboard and adding features related to UTM discounts and tax settings.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/index.tsx`: This file, updated at 10:50:47 and 11:11:09,  manages the UI for checkout configurations. The updates likely involve adding or refining the display of various discount configuration options.  The component renders several sub-components (`CodLimits`, `BlockDiscountCodes`, `DiscountCodes`, etc.), each likely representing a different aspect of checkout configuration.  The later update likely involved minor UI or structural adjustments.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/index.tsx`: Updated at 10:50:57 and 11:28:29, this file is the main settings page component.  Significant changes involve the addition of new settings sections ('Automatic Free Gift', 'Agent Led Settings'), and possibly updates to the menu structure to reflect the new additions.  The code also implements polling for agreement status and the rendering of an agreement signing banner. The structure of the settings menu is heavily modified based on the user's configuration and permissions (`config`, `isMerchantUser`).

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/searchProducts.tsx`:  This file, modified at 10:56:25, is a reusable component for searching and selecting products.  The component uses a modal for the product selection and allows incrementing/decrementing quantities. It incorporates debouncing for efficient search updates.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/utmDiscount.tsx`:  This file underwent multiple updates (11:01:00, 11:01:29, 11:05:54, 11:10:48) demonstrating iterative development of the UTM discounting section. The modifications focused primarily on refining the UTM discount configuration UI, adding input validation (checking for duplicate UTM parameters and ensuring required fields are filled), and improving error handling (using `message.error`). A key functional change includes the addition of a switch to enable or disable auto-application of discounts. The final changes seem to be around minor bug fixes and code cleanup (like removing unnecessary checks).


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/tax-settings/taxOverride.tsx`: Updated at 11:42:57 and 11:44:45, this component handles tax overrides. The changes are related to the UI for adding and managing tax overrides, which are likely to be product or shipping related. A debounce function is used for efficient collection searching.  The minor update at 11:44:45 likely fixes a logging issue within the collection fetching logic.


In summary, the code changes reflect a focused effort on enhancing the checkout configuration dashboard with a new UTM discount feature, improving the user interface, adding error handling and validation, and developing a component for handling tax overrides.  The multiple edits to `utmDiscount.tsx` suggest an iterative development process with bug fixes and refinements.  The overall pattern shows a consistent use of React and related libraries (`gokwik-ui-kit`, `react-redux`) to build a dynamic and user-friendly interface for merchant settings.

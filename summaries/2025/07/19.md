# Activity Summary for 19/07/2025

## 13:52:19
The log shows multiple revisions of a Python script (`whatsapp.py`) designed to send WhatsApp messages repeatedly.  The initial versions (12:52:55, 12:58:13, 12:58:47, 12:58:59) scheduled messages using `pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg`, specifying the hour and minute.  These versions differed primarily in the phone number and the `repeat_count` parameter, which increased from 5 to 50. The message content also changed from a simple reminder to a longer, repetitive phrase in Marathi.  Crucially, the `interval_minutes` parameter was initially 20 and reduced to 1 in one iteration at 12:59:59.

Starting at 13:04:40, the script was rewritten to use `pywhatkit.sendwhatmsg_instantly`, sending messages immediately instead of scheduling them.  Further changes between 13:04:40 and 13:12:57 primarily involved adjustments to the phone number and `repeat_count` again (between 5 and 50), and finally changing the sleep duration from 15 seconds to 20 minutes (`interval_minutes * 60`).  The message content remained consistent ("Baal Maze Jiv Maze Sagle Khi Pani Pi Maze Baal ❤️😍😘🥰💕") throughout these later revisions.  The final version at 13:12:57 sends 50 messages with a 20-minute delay between each.

# Activity Summary for 16/07/2025

## 12:31:32
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` between July 15th, 17:45:35 and July 16th, 11:04:00.  These updates primarily involve refining the handling of address input fields within a Svelte component.  The code manages different address input layouts (`oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, `suggestedAddressInputs`) based on various store variables like `$store_additionalAddress`, `$store_newAddressLayout`, and `$store_addressSuggestionFlow`.  Conditional logic dynamically adds or removes input fields, specifically a "Recipient Phone Number" field depending on `$store_enableRecipientPhone` and `$store_GSTBilling`.  The `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` lifecycle methods are used to manage the dynamic update of the `addressInputs` and `addressFields` variables based on the active layout.  The component also interacts extensively with various stores from `LoginStore` and `CommonStore`, suggesting a reactive architecture. The code's primary function is to manage user input for address information, handling different address formats and conditional requirements based on the application state.  There are many minor edits to the code within this time frame.  The most significant change occurs over the period of July 16th from 10:49:46 to 11:04:00, with multiple smaller commits refining the conditional logic and handling of different address input scenarios.  There's consistent use of reactive declarations (`$:`) and Svelte lifecycle methods (`onMount`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate`) throughout all versions of the file.

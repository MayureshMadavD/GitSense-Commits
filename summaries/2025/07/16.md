# Activity Summary for 16/07/2025

## 12:31:32
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` between July 15th, 17:45:35 and July 16th, 11:04:00.  These updates primarily involve refining the handling of address input fields within a Svelte component.  The code manages different address input layouts (`oldaddressInputs`, `newAddressInputs`, `suggestedAddressInputs`) based on various store variables like `$store_additionalAddress`, `$store_newAddressLayout`, and `$store_addressSuggestionFlow`.  Conditional logic dynamically adds or removes input fields, specifically a "Recipient Phone Number" field depending on `$store_enableRecipientPhone` and `$store_GSTBilling`.  The `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` lifecycle methods are used to manage the dynamic update of the `addressInputs` and `addressFields` variables based on the active layout.  The component also interacts extensively with various stores from `LoginStore` and `CommonStore`, suggesting a reactive architecture. The code's primary function is to manage user input for address information, handling different address formats and conditional requirements based on the application state.  There are many minor edits to the code within this time frame.  The most significant change occurs over the period of July 16th from 10:49:46 to 11:04:00, with multiple smaller commits refining the conditional logic and handling of different address input scenarios.  There's consistent use of reactive declarations (`$:`) and Svelte lifecycle methods (`onMount`, `beforeUpdate`, `afterUpdate`) throughout all versions of the file.


## 12:31:37
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` files.  The changes primarily focus on the `bannerComponentRenderer` component, enhancing its functionality and refining its behavior.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` Updates:**

The initial version (16:26:47) of `bannerComponentRenderer.tsx` renders a simple banner component with add and delete functionality using `gokwik-ui-kit` components.  Subsequent updates between 16:36:58 and 16:47:01 introduced drag-and-drop functionality for reordering banners, along with improved styling and positioning of the delete button.  The component's state management shifted from using `activeIds` to directly managing `bannerContent` as an array of `BannerComponentInterface` objects.  This significantly improved the data structure and simplified state updates.

A crucial change at 16:50:32 introduced unique `id` attributes to each banner using an `idCounter`, further enhancing the component's ability to handle multiple banners and improving the drag-and-drop functionality.  The `onChange` handler was modified to update the `bannerContent` state based on the index.

From 17:01:30 onward, modifications focused on handling the initial state of the `bannerContent` array to better accommodate different input types and providing a placeholder for empty banners.   There were many minor refinements to the handling of the initial state and updates, including the initial value of `htmlString`.

A significant change at 17:26:18 involved adding a 500ms debounce to the `handleChange` function using `setTimeout` to prevent excessive re-renders during rapid text edits.  This improves performance and reduces unnecessary state updates.

The final revisions (18:57:23 onwards) added an `Alert` component to inform the user about the minimum required number of banners (3) and refined the conditional rendering of the alert component.  Furthermore, the `editorChangeHandler` callback was modified to handle an array of `BannerComponentInterface` objects instead of a single `htmlString`.

**`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/login.tsx` Updates:**

This file, modified at 18:27:16 and 18:53:23, uses the `bannerComponentRenderer` component within a settings page for customizing the login section's UI.  The major changes in this file reflect the changes made to `bannerComponentRenderer`. At 18:53:23, a new prop `isMultiEnable` was added to `BannerComponentRenderer` and used in `login.tsx` to control the add button's visibility. The `renderFormItem` function was updated to accept this prop.  This makes the add-another-banner functionality conditionally available based on a property passed from Login component.


**Recurring Elements and Patterns:**

Throughout the log, there is a consistent focus on improving state management, error handling, and user experience. The use of functional components, hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`), and immutability (using spread syntax `...prev`) is prevalent.  The frequent updates to `bannerComponentRenderer` demonstrate an iterative development process, with features refined based on earlier implementations.  The final version of `bannerComponentRenderer` includes better support for diverse input types of `selectedValue`, improved drag-and-drop behavior, debounce for better performance, and clearer feedback to the user.


## 16:31:30
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` throughout the afternoon of July 16th, 2025.  These changes primarily involve modifying the logic within various functions that determine base URLs for different APIs (e.g., `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`) based on the current environment (`env`).  The `env` variable can take values such as 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', 'pci-prod', and others, each mapping to a different API endpoint.  The code also includes functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that vary depending on the environment.  There's a recurring pattern of conditional logic based on the `env` variable to select appropriate URLs for different API services.  The `setCart` function appears to initialize a cart object with specific data, potentially for local development purposes.  Note that there were no changes in the cart object after the first update of this file.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated once, at 15:37:08. This update involved modifications to the client-side JavaScript code responsible for initializing the Gokwik SDK and handling communication with the Gokwik platform using postMessage.  This code also includes logic for setting and getting cookies to track the landing page and referrer.  The  `merchantInfo` object is also defined here, providing details such as merchant ID (`mid`), environment, and Facebook Pixel ID.  It is worth noting the inclusion of hardcoded data such as merchant IDs.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/TwidPay/TwidPay.svelte` file underwent multiple updates between 15:46:08 and 16:01:48. These changes focus on enhancing the TwidPay reward system within the checkout UI. The code manages displaying and applying TwidPay rewards, handling interactions with a checkbox for enabling/disabling TwidPay, and showing a modal to choose between TwidPay and other offers when necessary.  The logic is complex, involving several store subscriptions and asynchronous operations to fetch and update rewards.  The file's structure suggests a Svelte component designed for rendering and managing TwidPay reward options in a checkout process. The most significant changes are related to the display of rewards and the handling of user interactions with the rewards.  The initial version shows the user only information about one reward, but the updates incrementally add the possibility of showing other rewards to the user.  Several conditional renderings control what is shown to the user, based on different parameters of the order. The commenting out of some lines shows that the component went through a considerable amount of refactoring.

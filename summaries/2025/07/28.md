# Activity Summary for 28/07/2025

## 12:29:39
The provided log shows two entries for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`, both on July 28, 2025.  The timestamps differ by only a minute (12:05:23 and 12:06:43), suggesting minor edits rather than substantial changes.  A comparison of the code snippets reveals no differences between the two versions.  The code itself defines a React component (`FreeGift`) for managing automatic free gift rules within a settings dashboard. It uses `Form.useForm` from a UI kit (`gokwik-ui-kit`) for managing form state and includes functionalities for adding, editing, deleting, and enabling/disabling free gift rules.  The component interacts with an API (`useMerchantConfigApi`) likely for persisting settings and uses several utility functions and hooks from a shared library (`@gokwik/utilities`, `@library/...`). The component handles various aspects of free gift configuration, including sales channels, purchase requirements (cart value or quantity), minimum/maximum values, product selection, and quantity/price settings.  There is a table displaying the configured rules with edit and delete actions.


## 14:29:42
The log shows a series of modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` file between 14:20:19 and 14:22:42 on July 28, 2025.  These changes appear to be focused on refining the UI component for managing automatic free gifts.  No significant structural changes are observed; instead, the modifications involve adding and altering state variables and potentially improving the component's functionality.  Specifically, a new state variable `isModalOpen` was introduced at 14:22:13.  The other changes seem to be minor adjustments within the component's existing structure,  likely bug fixes or small enhancements to the handling of free gift rules,  product selection, and collection management within the form.  The code consistently uses the `Form.useForm` and `Form.useWatch` hooks from the `gokwik-ui-kit` library, indicating a form-based approach to managing free gift settings.  The changes also reflect the management of free gift rules, allowing for their creation, editing, deletion, and enabling/disabling.  Finally, a separate file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` was updated at 14:23:12, likely dealing with the configuration and deployment setup of the dashboard UI, but details are omitted due to the presence of potential sensitive information (clarityKey, etc.).


## 16:30:08
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx` between 14:37:56 and 15:32:17 on July 28, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing automatic free gift rules in a checkout settings dashboard.

The most significant changes are:

* **14:42:53:** The `isModalOpen` state variable is changed from a boolean to an object `{ open: false, data: null }`, suggesting the addition of more complex modal functionality.

* **15:04:22 - 15:05:17:**  The `isModalOpen` state is further refined to  `{ open: false, missingRules: null, updatedRules: null }`, indicating a more sophisticated handling of missing or updated rules within the modal.  The typo "updatedRues" is corrected to "updatedRules".

* **15:29:44 - 15:32:17:**  The `isModalOpen` state is removed completely, along with related changes indicating a simplification or refactoring of the modal logic.  A `submitForm` function is added, indicating the addition of form submission functionality.

Throughout the log, there are numerous minor edits that don't affect the overall structure or functionality of the component. These minor changes are likely formatting adjustments or minor bug fixes.  The code consistently uses the `Form` component from `gokwik-ui-kit` for managing form data, and `useMerchantConfigApi` for interacting with merchant configuration. The component extensively uses nested arrays (`['merchant_config', 'auto_gift_rules_config', ...]`) for accessing and updating nested form data.  The component also incorporates features for adding, deleting, and enabling/disabling free gift rules, and handling different types of purchase requirements (cart value, quantity), and applies them across various sales channels (app, web, shopify_agent).

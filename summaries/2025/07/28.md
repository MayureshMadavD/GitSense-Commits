# Activity Summary for 28/07/2025

## 12:29:39
The provided log shows two entries for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/free-gift/freeGift.tsx`, both on July 28, 2025.  The timestamps differ by only a minute (12:05:23 and 12:06:43), suggesting minor edits rather than substantial changes.  A comparison of the code snippets reveals no differences between the two versions.  The code itself defines a React component (`FreeGift`) for managing automatic free gift rules within a settings dashboard. It uses `Form.useForm` from a UI kit (`gokwik-ui-kit`) for managing form state and includes functionalities for adding, editing, deleting, and enabling/disabling free gift rules.  The component interacts with an API (`useMerchantConfigApi`) likely for persisting settings and uses several utility functions and hooks from a shared library (`@gokwik/utilities`, `@library/...`). The component handles various aspects of free gift configuration, including sales channels, purchase requirements (cart value or quantity), minimum/maximum values, product selection, and quantity/price settings.  There is a table displaying the configured rules with edit and delete actions.

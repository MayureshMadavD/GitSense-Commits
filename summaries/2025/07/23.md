# Activity Summary for 23/07/2025

## 13:50:08
The log shows two significant code changes on July 23, 2025.

The first change, at 13:10:01, modifies `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`. This file is a TypeScript service managing environment-specific configurations.  The update involves numerous changes to the `api_url`, `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `getCredUrl`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`, `merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`, `XGokwikToken`, and `XKWIKPASSTOKEN` functions. These functions dynamically determine URLs and tokens based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The `setCart` and `setReqId` functions handle local environment initialization, setting up a sample cart and request ID. A significant portion of the update is dedicated to handling various environment configurations, suggesting a refactor or expansion to support a wider range of deployment environments.


The second change, at 13:10:19, updates `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`. This file is an HTML page likely representing a merchant's checkout integration.  The changes primarily involve JavaScript code that initializes a Gokwik SDK (`gokwikSdk`).  This SDK handles communication with the Gokwik payment gateway, including the `init`, `initCheckout`, `emit`, `on`, and `hideButton` functions.  The code also manages cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`) to track user interactions. Importantly, it contains hardcoded merchant information (including `mid`, `appid`, `appsecret`) within  `window.merchantInfo`, which should be treated carefully as it represents sensitive data. The HTML includes a button triggering a checkout process (`goKwikCheckout`) and some commented-out code suggesting previous iterations of the script inclusion.  The updated script dynamically loads the Gokwik SDK based on the environment and includes handling for the `initGKJS` event.

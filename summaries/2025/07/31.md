The log shows code changes across several files within a checkout UI project, primarily focusing on environment configuration and button functionality.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`  was updated at `31/07/2025, 00:44:07` and again at `31/07/2025, 01:32:36`. These updates involved modifications to the client-side JavaScript code handling merchant information and  the GoKwik SDK initialization.  The changes primarily involved setting and getting cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), managing the GoKwik SDK, and sending merchant information via `window.postMessage`.  Notably, the merchant information includes various `mid` (merchant ID) values, suggesting testing across different merchant environments (`qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice, at `31/07/2025, 00:44:43` and `31/07/2025, 00:44:54`. This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`, etc.).  The `api_url` function, in particular, underwent a small change in the 'local' environment handling between the two commits, shifting from commented-out alternative URLs to using `'https://api.gokwik.co'`. The file also contains functions to return tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which vary depending on the environment, and functions to manage various API endpoints based on the environment.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/ContinueButton.svelte` underwent three updates, at `31/07/2025, 00:46:11`, `31/07/2025, 00:48:05`, and `31/07/2025, 00:50:40`.  These changes focused on improving the button's behavior and presentation. The most significant change involves conditional rendering of the button text, initially using a simple ternary operator, and then refined using `typeof` to ensure that `continueButton?.primary_button_text` is a string before rendering it.  The button's functionality manages different stages of the checkout flow (pages), logs events, handles popup redirects, and displays prices correctly, including strikethrough for compared prices.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` was updated at `31/07/2025, 01:40:54`. This file, the main application component, initializes the application, manages various stores, and handles inter-component communication and event logging. It handles logic related to various checkout flows, payment methods, address management, handling different environments and logging various events and metrics.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts` was updated at `31/07/2025, 11:17:53`. This file manages discount logic, including fetching available offers, applying and removing discount codes, handling various types of discounts (payment, shipping, etc.), and interacting with the relevant API endpoints (`availableOffersCall`, `removePaymentsAutoOfferAPI`, etc.).  The update includes improved handling of email-based cohorts and  integrating the `showHidePaymentOffers` experiment to conditionally show/hide discount offers in the UI.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/OrderStore.ts`  was updated at `31/07/2025, 11:18:28`. This file defines Svelte stores that hold various states related to the order, including shipping information, payment information, discount information, etc.  The update reflects an addition of new stores to accommodate newer features such as handling UPI apps and further refinement of the emi details for card based emi.

The overall pattern indicates a continuous development process, with multiple iterations focusing on refining the checkout flow, improving error handling, and enhancing user experience by incorporating features based on experiments and A/B testing.  The frequent updates to `ContinueButton.svelte` highlight iterative UI adjustments, and the extensive conditional logic demonstrates responsiveness to various environments and user interactions.

# Activity Summary for 31/07/2025

## 12:50:37
The log shows code changes across several files within a checkout UI project, primarily focusing on environment configuration and button functionality.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`  was updated at `31/07/2025, 00:44:07` and again at `31/07/2025, 01:32:36`. These updates involved modifications to the client-side JavaScript code handling merchant information and  the GoKwik SDK initialization.  The changes primarily involved setting and getting cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), managing the GoKwik SDK, and sending merchant information via `window.postMessage`.  Notably, the merchant information includes various `mid` (merchant ID) values, suggesting testing across different merchant environments (`qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice, at `31/07/2025, 00:44:43` and `31/07/2025, 00:44:54`. This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, `local`, etc.).  The `api_url` function, in particular, underwent a small change in the 'local' environment handling between the two commits, shifting from commented-out alternative URLs to using `'https://api.gokwik.co'`. The file also contains functions to return tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which vary depending on the environment, and functions to manage various API endpoints based on the environment.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/ContinueButton.svelte` underwent three updates, at `31/07/2025, 00:46:11`, `31/07/2025, 00:48:05`, and `31/07/2025, 00:50:40`.  These changes focused on improving the button's behavior and presentation. The most significant change involves conditional rendering of the button text, initially using a simple ternary operator, and then refined using `typeof` to ensure that `continueButton?.primary_button_text` is a string before rendering it.  The button's functionality manages different stages of the checkout flow (pages), logs events, handles popup redirects, and displays prices correctly, including strikethrough for compared prices.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` was updated at `31/07/2025, 01:40:54`. This file, the main application component, initializes the application, manages various stores, and handles inter-component communication and event logging. It handles logic related to various checkout flows, payment methods, address management, handling different environments and logging various events and metrics.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts` was updated at `31/07/2025, 11:17:53`. This file manages discount logic, including fetching available offers, applying and removing discount codes, handling various types of discounts (payment, shipping, etc.), and interacting with the relevant API endpoints (`availableOffersCall`, `removePaymentsAutoOfferAPI`, etc.).  The update includes improved handling of email-based cohorts and  integrating the `showHidePaymentOffers` experiment to conditionally show/hide discount offers in the UI.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/OrderStore.ts`  was updated at `31/07/2025, 11:18:28`. This file defines Svelte stores that hold various states related to the order, including shipping information, payment information, discount information, etc.  The update reflects an addition of new stores to accommodate newer features such as handling UPI apps and further refinement of the emi details for card based emi.

The overall pattern indicates a continuous development process, with multiple iterations focusing on refining the checkout flow, improving error handling, and enhancing user experience by incorporating features based on experiments and A/B testing.  The frequent updates to `ContinueButton.svelte` highlight iterative UI adjustments, and the extensive conditional logic demonstrates responsiveness to various environments and user interactions.


## 14:50:33
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project between 13:04 and 13:29 on July 31, 2025.  The most significant changes are related to the `EnvironmentService.ts` file and `Discounts.svelte` file.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`: This file underwent two updates within a minute (13:04:55 and 13:05:25).  Both updates appear to be minor, with no discernible changes in functionality based on the provided code snippets. The file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestion, etc.) based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  The URLs are extensively defined, suggesting a multi-environment setup.  There's also logic to handle different tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) depending on the environment.  A `setCart()` function initializes a cart object with sample data, which appears different between the two commits.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`: This file was updated at 13:05:49. The update involves JavaScript code managing a GoKwik SDK initialization, handling merchant information, and setting cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`).  The merchant information includes various merchant IDs (`mid`), indicating the file's role in handling multiple merchant integrations.  A significant portion of the JavaScript is dedicated to the integration with a GoKwik payment button and handling various messaging events for communication between the frontend and backend.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`: This file was updated twice, at 13:13:33 and 13:13:48, and then again at 13:29:16.  The component appears to be responsible for managing discounts and offers during the checkout process.  The code is extensive, dealing with various discount types (loyalty, gift cards, partner offers, etc.),  and utilizing numerous Svelte stores for state management. The file contains a significant amount of logic for applying and removing discounts, handling interactions with various APIs (`Discounts.service`, `MerchantAPI`, etc.), updating the UI based on discount availability, and logging events.  The changes between the 13:13 timestamps seem insignificant. However, the later update at 13:29:16 likely includes changes based on the extensive nature of the code.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/ShippingDiscount.service.ts`: This file was updated at 13:17:01. The file focuses on handling discount and shipping calculations, managing API calls (`discountShippingCall`, `updateCart`), and updating UI elements based on API responses. It uses a queue (`createApiResponseQueue`) to manage asynchronous API calls. The service handles various scenarios including applying loyalty discounts and managing gift card applications.  The service also incorporates error handling and confetti effects for visual feedback on successful discount application.


In summary, the changes reflect ongoing development work on a checkout UI, focusing on integrating various payment and discount services (GoKwik, Cred, loyalty programs, gift cards).  The code demonstrates a complex system with multi-environment support and extensive state management.  The frequent updates to `Discounts.svelte` suggest active development and refinement of the discount application logic.


## 15:51:32
The log shows modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout` project.  The most significant changes are within the `checkout-dashboard-ui` component, specifically the `/src/pages/settings/checkout-links/index.tsx` file. This file underwent multiple revisions between 00:07:54 and 00:18:17, primarily involving minor adjustments and additions within the component's rendering logic; no significant functional changes were made during this period. The final change at 00:37:47 added `setIsFormChanged(true)` to the `handleAddProduct` and `handleRemoveProduct` functions, indicating an improvement in form state management.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file was modified twice (00:00:33 and 00:01:56).  These changes appear to be related to environment-specific configuration of import maps for various modules (`@gokwik/*`).  The initial version included local and `dev` environment configurations, while the second revision added `qa` and `sandbox` configurations.  The `production` environment includes clarity and New Relic scripts. The import maps define where to load various React, single-spa, and Gokwik-related JavaScript modules based on the environment.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/.env` file was modified twice (00:00:47 and 00:02:03), detailing environment variables for `REACT_APP_BASE_URL` and `REACT_APP_BULK_DISCOUNT_URL`, but these changes are not summarized further due to their sensitive nature.

Finally, the `/src/pages/settings/checkout-configs/tieredDiscounts.tsx` and `/src/pages/settings/payment/index.tsx` files were modified at 14:10:20 and 14:12:17 respectively, and then again at 14:12:26 and 14:16:06. These changes appear to add or enable a new "Tiered Prepaid Discounts" tab within the "Payment Settings" section of the UI, and the corresponding component (`tieredDiscounts.tsx`) was significantly enhanced to handle tiered discounts.


## 16:50:28
The log shows updates to two files within the `checkout-dashboard-ui` project on July 31, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/integration-settings/loyaltyPoints.tsx` was updated at 16:23:18.  This file is a React component responsible for managing loyalty point integrations.  The changes involve adding UI elements (using `gokwik-ui-kit` components) for managing multiple loyalty providers (Pop Coins, Nector, Flits, Yotpo, Credit Yard, Easy Rewards, Xeno).  The component handles enabling/disabling providers, customizing settings via a drawer, and saving configuration changes using Redux (`saveCreds`, `useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`).  Significant logic is included to handle saving credentials for each provider,  ensuring only one is active at a time and correctly formatting data for saving.  The code also includes error handling and uses `deepEqualAndDiff` for efficient change detection.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx` was updated twice, at 16:25:27 and 16:25:38.  These updates are minor and seem to not introduce any functional change.  The file is a reusable React component rendering forms for various integration settings. The component uses Form.useWatch to track form values, and includes various input types (Switch, Input, InputNumber, Select, Checkbox), alerts, tooltips, and links to other settings pages.  The two updates likely involved minor formatting or refactoring within the component, with no significant additions or removals of features.  The component handles rendering forms based on the `fieldKey` prop,  and includes helper components for tooltips and alerts.  The code is highly structured with constants for alerts and input definitions, making it easier to maintain. The only difference between the two commits in this file is the timestamp.


## 18:50:28
The log shows modifications to two files between 18:19 and 18:24 on July 31, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent three nearly instantaneous updates.  The changes appear minor and primarily involve the `api_url` function.  In the initial version, the `local` environment's URL was inconsistently defined with multiple commented-out options.  Subsequent updates settled on `https://api.gokwik.co` for the `local` environment URL. No other significant functional changes were observed.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/WalletCredits.svelte` was updated once, at 18:24:05. This update modified the conditional rendering logic related to displaying and applying wallet credits.  Specifically, it introduced a condition `&& disable_discount_with_credits !== false` within an `else if` block controlling the display of the wallet credits section when `applicableCredits` exist. This suggests an enhancement to handle cases where discounts and credits cannot be combined.  The styling of the component remained unchanged.


## 18:50:32
The log shows multiple updates to two files: `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/integration-settings/loyaltyPoints.tsx` and `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx`.  There are no changes to the content of `loyaltyPoints.tsx` after the initial commit at 16:53:10.


The `formRender.tsx` file underwent several revisions between 16:59:32 and 17:45:39.  These revisions primarily involved modifications to the `loyaltyInputs` and `rewardInputs` arrays within the `RenderForm` component.  These arrays define the UI elements for configuring loyalty points and reward programs.  The changes added tooltips to clarify the functionality of various settings, suggesting an effort to improve user understanding and documentation. There were no significant structural changes to the component itself; the modifications were largely focused on enhancing the existing input elements with more detailed explanations and improved user experience.

# Activity Summary for 12/09/2025

## 13:06:37
The Dockerfile located at `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` was updated on 12/09/2025 at 00:34:29.  The changes reflect a standard Node.js application build process within a Docker container.  Key steps include: using a Node.js 20 Alpine base image; setting the working directory; installing OpenSSL; copying package files and installing dependencies using `npm ci`; copying the application source code; generating a Prisma schema using `npx prisma generate`; building the application with `npm run build`; exposing port 3000; and finally starting the application with `npm start`.  The update suggests a complete rebuild or initial setup of the application's Docker image.  There are no apparent recurring elements besides standard npm and docker commands.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated at 23:43:30 on 11/09/2025.  This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API, Cred, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, CDN, analytics) based on the current environment ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.).  The functions extensively use conditional logic to determine the appropriate URL for each environment.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with sample data, seemingly for local development.  The file also includes functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) differing based on environment.  Numerous environment-specific URLs are hardcoded within the functions.  The code suggests a system designed for handling multiple environments, from local development to production.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file was updated at 23:43:55 on 11/09/2025. This file is an HTML page containing a merchant interface.  It incorporates a Javascript SDK (`gokwikSdk`) to manage interactions, including initiating checkout via `goKwikCheckout` function.  It features a form allowing users to input merchant IDs and JSON data, which are saved to cookies using `saveData` function.  The page includes a button to initiate the checkout process, and it uses cookies to store merchant information, cart data and form data (including selected environment from dropdown).  The Javascript code also demonstrates the use of `window.postMessage` for communication between the page and potentially an embedded checkout modal, and shows  handling of messages from this modal (receiving "Gokwik ready!"). The HTML includes commented-out code hinting at previous analytics integration attempts using `devanalytics.gokwik.co` .  The presence of a commented-out `loadData()` function implies the functionality to load data from cookies may have existed previously.  The merchant information within the Javascript code includes a placeholder, numerous commented-out merchant IDs and associated environments which suggest it is used for testing with various merchants and environments.

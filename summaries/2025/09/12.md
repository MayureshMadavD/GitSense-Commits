# Activity Summary for 12/09/2025

## 13:06:37
The Dockerfile located at `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/Dockerfile` was updated on 12/09/2025 at 00:34:29.  The changes reflect a standard Node.js application build process within a Docker container.  Key steps include: using a Node.js 20 Alpine base image; setting the working directory; installing OpenSSL; copying package files and installing dependencies using `npm ci`; copying the application source code; generating a Prisma schema using `npx prisma generate`; building the application with `npm run build`; exposing port 3000; and finally starting the application with `npm start`.  The update suggests a complete rebuild or initial setup of the application's Docker image.  There are no apparent recurring elements besides standard npm and docker commands.

# Activity Summary for 16/09/2025

The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/trustBanner.svelte`, a Svelte component displaying a trust banner.  The primary focus of the changes is on styling and dynamic content.

Initially (around 23:13:48), the banner displayed only one trust badge. Subsequent updates (23:14:18 - 23:15:53) added two more badges, adjusting line breaks in the text.  Between 23:18:03 and 23:20:14, the styling of the `.track` class was adjusted, changing `width` from `100%` to `auto` and adding `justify-content: center;`. The `max-width` of the `.carousel` class was reduced from 600px to 500px around 23:20:14. The  `.text` class's `max-width` was adjusted from 180px to 160px around 23:22:21.

Several revisions (23:24:11, 23:32:27, 23:38:08-23:41:28) involved commenting out or uncommenting the trust badges, ultimately leading to only two or three being displayed and consistent styling changes such as font size,  and margin adjustments to the `.security-badge` class.  The most significant styling changes involved the horizontal spacing of the badges within the banner, which was refined through multiple adjustments to `margin-left` within the inline styles of `.security-badge` (23:44:50 onwards).  The final adjustments fine-tuned these margins (23:47:52 - 23:59:45).

A major functional change occurred at 00:03:33 on 16/09/2025. The `intervalTime` for the banner's animation was made dynamic, using `trustBannerData?.trust_timer` from a store.  Further modifications (11:01:11 - 11:02:51) introduced a `bannerList` variable, allowing the component to dynamically switch between a default list of trust badges (`DEFAULT_TRUST_BANNER`) and a custom list based on data from the `trustBannerData` store.  This change also corrected the `nextSlide` function to use `bannerList.length` for the modulo operation to ensure correct cycling through the displayed badges.  The conditional rendering (`{#if trustBannerData?.trust_type === 'standard'}`) ensures that the custom margin-left styling only applies to the standard trust banner type.

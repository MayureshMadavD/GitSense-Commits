# Activity Summary for 16/09/2025

## 11:12:15
The log shows a series of modifications to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/trustBanner.svelte`, a Svelte component displaying a trust banner.  The primary focus of the changes is on styling and dynamic content.

Initially (around 23:13:48), the banner displayed only one trust badge. Subsequent updates (23:14:18 - 23:15:53) added two more badges, adjusting line breaks in the text.  Between 23:18:03 and 23:20:14, the styling of the `.track` class was adjusted, changing `width` from `100%` to `auto` and adding `justify-content: center;`. The `max-width` of the `.carousel` class was reduced from 600px to 500px around 23:20:14. The  `.text` class's `max-width` was adjusted from 180px to 160px around 23:22:21.

Several revisions (23:24:11, 23:32:27, 23:38:08-23:41:28) involved commenting out or uncommenting the trust badges, ultimately leading to only two or three being displayed and consistent styling changes such as font size,  and margin adjustments to the `.security-badge` class.  The most significant styling changes involved the horizontal spacing of the badges within the banner, which was refined through multiple adjustments to `margin-left` within the inline styles of `.security-badge` (23:44:50 onwards).  The final adjustments fine-tuned these margins (23:47:52 - 23:59:45).

A major functional change occurred at 00:03:33 on 16/09/2025. The `intervalTime` for the banner's animation was made dynamic, using `trustBannerData?.trust_timer` from a store.  Further modifications (11:01:11 - 11:02:51) introduced a `bannerList` variable, allowing the component to dynamically switch between a default list of trust badges (`DEFAULT_TRUST_BANNER`) and a custom list based on data from the `trustBannerData` store.  This change also corrected the `nextSlide` function to use `bannerList.length` for the modulo operation to ensure correct cycling through the displayed badges.  The conditional rendering (`{#if trustBannerData?.trust_type === 'standard'}`) ensures that the custom margin-left styling only applies to the standard trust banner type.


## 13:12:15
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/trustBanner.tsx` file was updated on 16/09/2025 at 12:52:45.  This component, `TrustBadgeForm`,  is a React form for managing trust banners.  It uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components for the UI and includes features for adding, deleting, and reordering trust badges.  The form handles image uploads (`validateUploadedImage`, `handleImageUpload`), form validation, and updates the form state using `form.setFieldValue`.  It also dynamically renders form fields (`RenderField`) based on the selected trust banner type (`standard` or `custom`).  The `TrustBadgeTable` component renders a draggable table for managing a list of custom trust badges.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/mobile.tsx` file was updated on 16/09/2025 at 12:59:20. This component, `MobileStepUI`, renders a mobile UI preview for checkout settings. It uses various components from `gokwik-ui-kit` and displays different sections based on the active tab (`brand`, `login`, `payments`, `checkoutElement`, `address`, `coupons`).  The component fetches and displays coupon data, including a limited set of 5 coupons if there are more than 5 available.  It also dynamically renders trust banner data, using `defaultTrustBannerList` if custom data is not available or of `trust_type` is not 'custom'.  The component incorporates conditional rendering based on the active tab and data availability, showing placeholders (Skeleton) when data is loading or missing.  There is logic to display different sections and conditional styling depending on the data received (e.g., `loginData`, `addressData`, `paymentData`).


## 17:12:13
The log shows a single significant code change at 16/09/2025, 16:28:01, affecting `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs`.  This file is an EJS template that dynamically generates an HTML page based on environment variables (`isLocal`, `deployedEnv`). The update involves modifications to the import map, specifying different URLs for various @gokwik packages depending on the environment (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The production environment includes additional scripts for clarity and New Relic monitoring.  The New Relic code uses systemjs-importmap for dependency management, indicating a modular frontend application.  There's a clear pattern of conditional loading based on the `deployedEnv` variable, ensuring that the appropriate URLs for different environments are used.  The production environment also conditionally includes Clarity and New Relic monitoring scripts, based on the existence of a `clarityKey` variable.


## 18:12:18
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`.  The file is a React component (`ShippingMethodConfig`) responsible for configuring shipping methods.  Changes span from 17:25:16 to 18:04:56 on September 16, 2025.

Key changes across revisions include modifications to the `useEffect` hook's dependency array. Initially, it was commented out, then updated to depend on `shippingConfig`, and finally settled on an empty array (`[]`), making it run only once after the initial render.  This suggests optimization efforts to improve performance.

Another significant change involves the `shippingConfiguration` state variable's initialization. It initially was set to an empty array and  then changed to `shippingConfig || []`, ensuring the state reflects the initial `shippingConfig` prop if provided.

The code consistently uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library, making extensive use of its form handling capabilities (`Form.useForm`, `Form.useWatch`).  The component also interacts with a backend API (`makeAPICall`) for fetching customer segments, uploading and downloading CSV files containing pincodes, and retrieving pre-signed URLs for AWS S3 uploads. Error handling is present throughout asynchronous operations using `try...catch` blocks, and user feedback is provided through the `message` function from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  The component's main functionality appears to be managing a form for creating and updating shipping price configurations, allowing for advanced conditions and CSV uploads of pincodes for targeted shipping.  There is extensive input validation present in the `fields` array.


## 21:39:35
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file between 18:13:27 and 20:57:12 on September 16, 2025.  The changes primarily involve refinements to a React component responsible for configuring shipping methods.

The core functionality remains consistent throughout all revisions: fetching customer segments, handling form submission for shipping price configuration, uploading and downloading CSV files containing pincodes, and displaying a user interface with form fields for shipping name, price, minimum and maximum order values.

Between 18:13:27 and 18:37:28, several minor updates occurred.  The most notable change was at 18:33:57, where the `draggedRow` state variable was replaced with `dragOverRow`. This suggests improvements to drag-and-drop functionality within the component.


Later revisions, starting from 20:39:52 to 20:57:12 show no significant code changes. The code remains functionally identical across these commits, indicating minor edits, potentially related to formatting or linting, rather than major feature additions or bug fixes.  The overall structure and functionality of the component didn't change during these later commits.

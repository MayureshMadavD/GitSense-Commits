# Activity Summary for 23/09/2025

## 12:33:06
The log shows three nearly identical commits to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` within a short time frame (11:46:49, 11:46:54, and 11:47:00).  The changes are minor and appear to be incremental updates to the same code section. The core functionality remains consistent across all three commits, focusing on handling checkout processes, managing various store variables, and interacting with an iframe to receive 'launch' data.  The code manages a substantial number of Svelte stores (`store_...`), suggesting a complex state management system for the checkout UI.  The `onMount` lifecycle function handles browser back button events and message events from an iframe. The message events primarily involve receiving data to populate stores related to user information, cart details, merchant information, and various configuration settings.  The updates across the three commits seem to be related to  handling the `shopify_landing_page` data within the `store_shopifyCookieInfo`.  There is also error handling for checkout link expiry.  The code extensively uses asynchronous operations and integrates with various services (`MerchantAPI`, `EventService`, etc.).  The timestamps indicate a rapid iteration cycle, likely during debugging or feature refinement.


## 16:33:07
The provided log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` between 15:40:16 and 15:43:09 on September 23, 2025.  These revisions appear to involve minor adjustments within the `<script>` tag; the core functionality related to discount calculations, application, and display remains consistent across all changes. The code heavily utilizes Svelte stores (`store_*`), managing various aspects of the checkout process, including cart details, addresses, payment methods, discount codes, and loyalty programs.  There's extensive use of interfaces to define data structures. The code interacts with numerous services for functionalities like discount calculations (`Discounts.service`), payment processing (`PaymentOptions.service`, `CardPayment.service`), and analytics (`EventService`, `ForeignAnalytics`).


The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file, updated at 15:47:07, defines functions to construct API base URLs depending on the environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  It also includes functions to generate tokens (XGokwikToken, XKWIKPASSToken) specific to each environment.  The `setCart` function initializes a cart object with sample data; this is likely used for local development purposes.  The file shows a high degree of conditional logic to handle the various possible environments and related endpoints.

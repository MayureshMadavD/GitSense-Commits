The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`.  The file is a React component for editing orders, heavily utilizing the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library.

The earliest revisions (23:24:39, 23:24:45) contain the initial version of the component's code, which includes features for managing line items (adding, removing, modifying quantities), applying discounts (fixed amount and percentage based), and handling recently deleted items. The code uses `useSelector` and `useMemo` hooks from React and Redux for state management and performance optimization.  The component renders a table to display order items with columns for product details, quantity, and total, and also handles discount calculation and application.

A significant change occurs at 23:26:56. The `deleteItem` function is updated to accept `record?.properties_hash` as a parameter. This suggests an improvement in handling product deletion, likely to better manage products with varying properties.

A minor change at 23:27:49 refines the `deleteItem` function again, likely for consistency or minor bug fixes. The code remains functionally similar to the previous version.

Further minor refinements to the `deleteItem` function are made at 23:29:04 and 23:29:24. These changes appear to be focused on improving the way the `properties_hash` is handled within `deleteItem`.

A more substantial change happens at 23:46:21,  adding `properties_hash` to the `recentlyDeletedData` and modifying the `handleReAddItem` function to accept and use `properties_hash` for more precise re-adding of items, especially those with the same `variant_id` but different properties. This addresses the potential issue of duplicate items with different configurations.

The final revision (23:50:23) further enhances the `handleReAddItem` function's logic to ensure that only unique items (considering both `variant_id` and `properties_hash`) are added back, preventing potential duplicates.

Throughout the log, there's a consistent focus on improving the handling of product variations and their properties, using `properties_hash` to ensure accurate identification and management of line items.  The majority of changes are focused on this core functionality. The timestamps show a concentrated period of development and refinement around the discount and line item management features.

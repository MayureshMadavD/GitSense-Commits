# Activity Summary for 08/09/2025

## 15:29:43
The log shows code changes on August 9th, 2025,  primarily focusing on environment-specific configurations and merchant information handling.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (14:53:09): This file is an HTML page for merchant interaction.  It includes a form to input merchant ID and JSON data, which are then saved to cookies.  There's a button to initiate checkout using `window.postMessage`, sending merchant information including a hardcoded merchant ID (`gh0yshvkmca4pw4`), app ID and app secret. The code also manages cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`), dynamically loads a script (`gokwik.js`), and interacts with a Privy widget.  The code also contains a large number of commented-out merchant IDs, suggesting that this file has been modified repeatedly to test different merchant integration.  The presence of commented-out analytics script suggests earlier attempts at integrating an analytics library.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (14:53:43 and 14:53:54): This TypeScript file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, and others).  There are multiple functions (e.g., `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`) that return different URLs based on the environment variable 'env'. The `api_url` function handles numerous environment types, each with a corresponding URL, highlighting the complex environment management structure.  A notable change between the two timestamps is within the `api_url` function where the URL for the `local` environment is updated from commented-out options to  `'https://api.gokwik.co'`.  The file also defines functions to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) and merchant URLs based on the environment.  The `setCart` function sets a sample cart object to the store which is likely used in local development.  The file subscribes to MobX stores (`store_merchanturl`, `store_environment`, `store_cashToPrepaid`) for reactive updates.

The provided code logs show updates to several files within a checkout UI project, specifically focusing on  `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` directory.  The most significant changes revolve around the `MerchantAPI.ts` file, which underwent two updates within a short timeframe (08/09/2025, 15:53:30 and 08/09/2025, 15:55:24).  These updates appear to involve extensive modifications to asynchronous API functions handling various aspects of the checkout process, including cart management, user authentication (checkLogin, submitPhoneNumber), address management (addAddress, deleteAddress), and experiment tracking (getUserExperiments, assignUserVariant).  The code extensively uses `store` objects suggesting a reactive state management approach.  The `MerchantAPI.ts` updates show no apparent changes in functionality, only potentially minor formatting or internal refactoring.


The `DeliverAddress.svelte` file was updated twice (08/09/2025, 16:13:24 and 08/09/2025, 16:14:36), with the second update un-commenting a `<button>` element, enabling users to navigate to an address listing. This component interacts with `MerchantAPI.ts` to retrieve and display delivery address information.


The `Helper.service.ts` file (08/09/2025, 16:29:36) contains a large number of functions managing various aspects of the checkout flow, including store subscriptions, bottom sheet management (closeBottomSheet, closeFullScreenPopUp), order processing (setCreateOrderStores), and utility functions (getBadgeTitle, detectAutofill).  It also demonstrates interactions with several stores within the application and extensive use of asynchronous operations.  This file heavily relies on other services and stores within the project. The code uses a lot of subscriptions to stores which suggests a reactive programming style.


## 17:29:48
The log shows multiple revisions to two Svelte components, `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Helper.service.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte`, between 16:32:58 and 17:21:14 on August 9, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Helper.service.ts`  underwent two revisions.  The changes primarily involved updates to functions managing various aspects of the checkout process.  These include functions for handling autofill events (`autofillEvents`), closing different UI elements (`closeBottomSheet`, `closeIframe`, `closeFullScreenPopUp`), setting order-related store values (`setCreateOrderStores`), and determining discount badge titles (`getBadgeTitle`). The subscriptions to multiple stores are also present in the code to update the state of various variables according to the data from the stores. There is an `setAddress` function which takes an `AddressResponseInterface` as input and sets the `store_selectedAddress` store.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` was modified multiple times. The component manages address input fields.  The primary focus of the revisions was refining the handling of address input, particularly concerning conditional rendering and data updates based on various store values like `store_additionalAddress`, `store_addressSuggestionFlow`, and `store_enableRecipientPhone`.  There are several subscriptions to stores which update the state of variables such as `editFlag`, `pincode`, `selectedAddress`, and `phoneNo` from their respective stores.  The code also includes logic for handling KwikPass logins and incorporating GST billing information.  The core functionality of updating address information remains consistent, but conditional logic and event handling have seen considerable adjustments across the various commits.  The changes in the later revisions focuses on simplifying and optimizing the code and removing unnecessary logs.

# Activity Summary for 08/09/2025

## 15:29:43
The log shows code changes on August 9th, 2025,  primarily focusing on environment-specific configurations and merchant information handling.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (14:53:09): This file is an HTML page for merchant interaction.  It includes a form to input merchant ID and JSON data, which are then saved to cookies.  There's a button to initiate checkout using `window.postMessage`, sending merchant information including a hardcoded merchant ID (`gh0yshvkmca4pw4`), app ID and app secret. The code also manages cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`), dynamically loads a script (`gokwik.js`), and interacts with a Privy widget.  The code also contains a large number of commented-out merchant IDs, suggesting that this file has been modified repeatedly to test different merchant integration.  The presence of commented-out analytics script suggests earlier attempts at integrating an analytics library.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (14:53:43 and 14:53:54): This TypeScript file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various services based on the environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, and others).  There are multiple functions (e.g., `getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`) that return different URLs based on the environment variable 'env'. The `api_url` function handles numerous environment types, each with a corresponding URL, highlighting the complex environment management structure.  A notable change between the two timestamps is within the `api_url` function where the URL for the `local` environment is updated from commented-out options to  `'https://api.gokwik.co'`.  The file also defines functions to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) and merchant URLs based on the environment.  The `setCart` function sets a sample cart object to the store which is likely used in local development.  The file subscribes to MobX stores (`store_merchanturl`, `store_environment`, `store_cashToPrepaid`) for reactive updates.

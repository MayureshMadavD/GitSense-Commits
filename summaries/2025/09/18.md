# Activity Summary for 18/09/2025

## 11:08:46
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` file was updated on 17/09/2025 at 23:34:05.  The update significantly modifies the `requestMapDiscount.setup` function. This function handles the mapping of discount data, including  logic for different discount types (`cartItemsDiscount`, `bundleDiscount`, `tieredDiscount`, `discountedCartItems`, `shippingDiscount`).  It incorporates extensive product and collection management, using functions like `mapProducts` and `mapCollections` to compare and update product and collection data based on existing and new data.  `mapProducts` specifically uses `compareProductArrays` to handle additions, removals, and variant mismatches within product lists. The `editCollectionId` function ensures Shopify collection IDs are correctly formatted.  The code heavily relies on Shopify APIs for fetching product and collection data. The update also includes helper functions for data manipulation, such as `assignMatchType` and several others for mapping and comparing collections and products.  The changes suggest a robust system for managing discounts in a Shopify context, allowing for granular control over products, collections, and discount application rules.  The use of `previous` data in the `setup` function implies this update is designed for managing changes to existing discounts.

The provided log shows updates to two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui` directory.  Both are related to shipping settings within a checkout dashboard UI.


`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` (18/09/2025, 11:30:44): This file contains extensive logic for managing discounts, particularly those related to cart items, bundles, tiered discounts, and shipping.  Key functions include `requestMapDiscount`, which handles the mapping and structuring of discount data for API requests, and several helper functions (`assignMatchType`, `editCollectionId`, `mapCollections`, `fetchAllProductsByIds`, `responseMapCollections`, `responseMapProducts`, `mapProducts`) for data transformation and fetching product/collection information from Shopify. The code extensively uses Shopify's `gid` identifiers for products and collections and performs complex comparisons between existing and new product/variant data to determine additions and removals.

`/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` (18/09/2025, 11:42:30, 11:52:35, 11:53:28): This React component handles the configuration of shipping methods.  It uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components for the UI and interacts with several helper functions from `@library/utilities/helpers/helper` (e.g., `deepCompare`, `formatAmount`, `uploadCohortCsv`).  The component fetches customer segments using `fetchCustomerSegments` from the discount store.  Significant updates involve the handling of CSV uploads for pincodes, with changes to the logic for validating the format of uploaded CSV files (single column, horizontal, or vertical). The code also includes functions for uploading and downloading CSV files to/from a server using signed URLs and managing form data for shipping configurations.  Multiple updates to this file within a short time frame suggest iterative development and debugging of the CSV upload and validation process.  The use of `makeAPICall` indicates communication with a backend API.

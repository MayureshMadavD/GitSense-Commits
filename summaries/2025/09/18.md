# Activity Summary for 18/09/2025

## 11:08:46
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/store/discounts/api.ts` file was updated on 17/09/2025 at 23:34:05.  The update significantly modifies the `requestMapDiscount.setup` function. This function handles the mapping of discount data, including  logic for different discount types (`cartItemsDiscount`, `bundleDiscount`, `tieredDiscount`, `discountedCartItems`, `shippingDiscount`).  It incorporates extensive product and collection management, using functions like `mapProducts` and `mapCollections` to compare and update product and collection data based on existing and new data.  `mapProducts` specifically uses `compareProductArrays` to handle additions, removals, and variant mismatches within product lists. The `editCollectionId` function ensures Shopify collection IDs are correctly formatted.  The code heavily relies on Shopify APIs for fetching product and collection data. The update also includes helper functions for data manipulation, such as `assignMatchType` and several others for mapping and comparing collections and products.  The changes suggest a robust system for managing discounts in a Shopify context, allowing for granular control over products, collections, and discount application rules.  The use of `previous` data in the `setup` function implies this update is designed for managing changes to existing discounts.

# Activity Summary for 01/09/2025

## 12:33:52
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` file, last updated on 01/09/2025 at 12:12:20, is a TypeScript file containing numerous asynchronous functions for interacting with a merchant's API.  These functions handle various aspects of an e-commerce checkout process, including:

* **Cart Management:**  Functions like `getCartJs`, `getAbandonCart`, and `updateCartAnalytics` manage cart data, including retrieving cart details, handling abandoned carts, and updating cart analytics.  The `getRequestId` function is crucial for obtaining a request ID, possibly for tracking purposes.  Significant use of `originalCart` and manipulation based on `merchantInfo.mmData` and `requestIdObject` suggests handling of different cart representations or configurations.

* **User Authentication and Login:** `submitPhoneNumber`, `checkLogin`, `verifyOTP`, and `resendOtpCall` handle user authentication through phone number verification and token validation. The presence of `kwikpassToken` suggests integration with a third-party authentication system.  The functions include handling of various custom parameters, such as `cf_user_customer_id`, `cf_user_id`, `cf_dimension_id`, and `cf_session_id`, which likely come from a data layer for tracking and analytics.

* **Address Management:** `deleteAddress`, `verifyPincode`, `addAddress`, `getAllAddress`, and `editAddress` manage user addresses, covering actions like adding, deleting, verifying pincodes, and retrieving all addresses.  Error handling is present in `editAddress` for missing 'aid' parameter.

* **Experimentation and Personalization:** `getUserExperiments` and `assignUserVariant` interact with an experimentation service to retrieve and assign user variants for A/B testing or personalized experiences.

* **Payment and Offers:** The code uses numerous variables related to payment methods, discounts (`store_offers`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, etc.), and offers, indicating a system for managing payment options and promotional offers.

The code heavily relies on a store-like system using variables subscribed to observable stores (`store_...`). This suggests a reactive programming pattern using a state management library.  The functions extensively use `getBody` to construct API request bodies, consistently including parameters such as `mid`, `os_type`, and `request_id`.  Error handling is minimal, mostly relying on try/catch blocks within an asynchronous queue processing mechanism (`apiRequestProcessingQueue`). The use of `x-gokwik-token` and other custom headers indicates the usage of authentication tokens and custom headers.  The presence of several functions related to handling and modification of cart objects based on `merchantInfo` and `requestIdObject` suggests significant customization or merchant-specific configuration.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/tax-settings/taxOverride.tsx` on January 9th, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing tax overrides.  Key changes include:

* **12:56:07:** Initial commit of the `TaxOverride` component.  This version includes a form for adding tax overrides with fields for "Tax Override For?", "Collection", "State", "Tax Type", and "Tax Rate (%)".  It also uses a table to display existing overrides and allows for their removal. The component fetches Shopify collections via `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`.  A `debounce` function is used to control the rate of API calls.

* **12:56:49 - 13:01:19 (multiple minor revisions):** These revisions primarily involved adding or removing `console.log` statements for debugging purposes within the `fetchCollections` function, which retrieves and updates the list of Shopify collections displayed in the component's form.  The logs track the search text, the API response, and the updated collections state.  There were no functional changes to the component's logic during this period.

* **13:06:01 - 13:08:44 (multiple minor revisions):**  Further debugging using `console.log` statements to track the filtering and merging of collections data within the `fetchCollections` function.  A log shows the array before and after filtering/merging.

* **13:12:12 - 13:12:34:** A `console.log` statement displaying the `collections` state was moved outside of the `fetchCollections` function to show the final state of the collection data.

* **13:17:03 - 13:17:58:**  A significant change was made in the `fetchCollections` function.  The API call is now conditionally triggered only if the search text has at least 3 characters.  Also, `filterOption` is set to `false` in the collection select input's `inputProps`.  Emptying the collections state (`setCollections([])`) before the API call is added, ensuring the collection list is cleared before fetching new data.

Throughout the log, the component consistently utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and demonstrates a pattern of using `useCallback`, `useState`, and `useRef` hooks for managing state and side effects. The component also includes robust filtering and data handling for states and tax types.  The primary focus of the changes seems to be refining the collection fetching and display logic.


## 15:33:51
The log shows two nearly identical revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts`  at 14:47:41 and 14:48:25 on January 9th, 2025.  The changes between these two commits are insignificant, possibly just whitespace or formatting differences. The file defines numerous TypeScript interfaces for data structures related to order management, including `Order`, `LineItem`, `Transaction`, `CartItem`, and many others.  These interfaces are comprehensive, covering various aspects of orders, payments, shipping, discounts, and refunds.

A React component, `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/agentLed/paymentsSettings.tsx`,  underwent two revisions at 15:01:19 and 15:01:37 on the same day. The changes between the two commits are minimal, seemingly related to removing the `loading` state from the `useMerchantConfigApi` hook.  The component is a settings page for configuring payment options, specifically focusing on COD (Cash on Delivery) blocking settings and payment link expiry times. It uses a Form component from a UI library ('gokwik-ui-kit'), showing various input fields like switches, input numbers, and a custom time picker. The component fetches and saves configuration data using a custom hook (`useMerchantConfigApi`).  A notable feature is the conditional rendering of COD limit input fields based on the `cod_limit_blocking` setting, and a link to a more detailed payment configuration page.


## 16:33:53
The log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` file and one revision of `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` file between 15:52 and 16:09 on January 9, 2025.  The `editAbcCart.tsx` file underwent several revisions focusing primarily on error handling within asynchronous functions (`fetchCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `fetchCustomerAddressess`, `fetchAddress`, `createOrder`).  Changes involved adding or modifying `console.log` statements for debugging purposes and selectively commenting out `message.error` calls.  The specific changes to error handling suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the component's error reporting mechanisms.  The `interface.ts` file shows a single update at 16:09 which involved adding or modifying several interfaces, primarily  `AbandonedCart`, `CartItem`, `Order`, `LineItem`, and others related to order details, line items, discounts, and shipping information.  This suggests an update to the data models used by `editAbcCart.tsx`.  The overall pattern in `editAbcCart.tsx` is focused on improving the robustness of the code by handling potential errors more gracefully during various API calls related to abandoned cart management and order creation.


## 17:33:52
The provided log shows multiple revisions of the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/abandoned-cart/abandoned-cart-details/editAbcCart.tsx` file between 17:19:56 and 17:25:47 on January 9, 2025.  The changes primarily focus on error handling within the asynchronous functions (`fetchCustomer`, `createCustomer`, `createAddress`, `fetchCustomerAddressess`, `fetchAddress`, `createOrder`).  Specifically,  `message.error` calls are added to provide more informative error messages to the user in cases of API failures.  In `fetchCustomerAddressess` and other functions, the error messages are improved by including the `response?.response?.data?.data?.statusMessage` for more specific error details. There are no structural changes to the code; only minor updates to the error handling logic are observed across all revisions within this timeframe.


## 23:14:03
The provided code logs show modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project across several files.  Significant changes occurred between 23:06:40 and 23:13:09 on January 9th, 2025.

The primary changes revolve around the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file, which underwent two nearly identical revisions within a short timeframe (23:06:40 and 23:06:51).  These revisions appear to be focused on updating various API base URLs based on the current environment ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.). The `api_url` function, in particular, shows extensive conditional logic to determine the appropriate API endpoint for different environments, including several development and testing variations.  A minor difference between the two versions of `EnvironmentService.ts` is the commented-out URL option and the change of URL to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co` for the `local` environment in the `api_url` function.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` file, updated at 23:07:13, contains client-side JavaScript code that interacts with the backend APIs. It includes functionality to save and load merchant information, initiate checkout, and manage cookies, suggesting a user interface for configuring and interacting with the Gokwik checkout system.  The script uses `window.postMessage` for communication between different parts of the system.  This file also demonstrates the implementation for handling different environments and merchant IDs.

Finally, the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/TotalContainer.svelte` file, updated at 23:13:09, shows a Svelte component responsible for displaying the order summary on a checkout page.  It dynamically calculates and displays various amounts (subtotal, discounts, gift cards, etc.), using reactive declarations (`$:`) and stores from the `CommonStore` and `OrderStore`.  This component also includes error handling and event logging (`logEvent`) for debugging and monitoring purposes.  The component handles various discount types, including coupon discounts, automatic discounts, loyalty discounts, and prepaid discounts, and presents them clearly in the UI.  There's also conditional logic to manage the display of discount details and gift card information based on user interaction.  The code shows comprehensive handling of various reward systems.

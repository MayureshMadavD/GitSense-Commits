The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` file, last updated on 01/09/2025 at 12:12:20, is a TypeScript file containing numerous asynchronous functions for interacting with a merchant's API.  These functions handle various aspects of an e-commerce checkout process, including:

* **Cart Management:**  Functions like `getCartJs`, `getAbandonCart`, and `updateCartAnalytics` manage cart data, including retrieving cart details, handling abandoned carts, and updating cart analytics.  The `getRequestId` function is crucial for obtaining a request ID, possibly for tracking purposes.  Significant use of `originalCart` and manipulation based on `merchantInfo.mmData` and `requestIdObject` suggests handling of different cart representations or configurations.

* **User Authentication and Login:** `submitPhoneNumber`, `checkLogin`, `verifyOTP`, and `resendOtpCall` handle user authentication through phone number verification and token validation. The presence of `kwikpassToken` suggests integration with a third-party authentication system.  The functions include handling of various custom parameters, such as `cf_user_customer_id`, `cf_user_id`, `cf_dimension_id`, and `cf_session_id`, which likely come from a data layer for tracking and analytics.

* **Address Management:** `deleteAddress`, `verifyPincode`, `addAddress`, `getAllAddress`, and `editAddress` manage user addresses, covering actions like adding, deleting, verifying pincodes, and retrieving all addresses.  Error handling is present in `editAddress` for missing 'aid' parameter.

* **Experimentation and Personalization:** `getUserExperiments` and `assignUserVariant` interact with an experimentation service to retrieve and assign user variants for A/B testing or personalized experiences.

* **Payment and Offers:** The code uses numerous variables related to payment methods, discounts (`store_offers`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, etc.), and offers, indicating a system for managing payment options and promotional offers.

The code heavily relies on a store-like system using variables subscribed to observable stores (`store_...`). This suggests a reactive programming pattern using a state management library.  The functions extensively use `getBody` to construct API request bodies, consistently including parameters such as `mid`, `os_type`, and `request_id`.  Error handling is minimal, mostly relying on try/catch blocks within an asynchronous queue processing mechanism (`apiRequestProcessingQueue`). The use of `x-gokwik-token` and other custom headers indicates the usage of authentication tokens and custom headers.  The presence of several functions related to handling and modification of cart objects based on `merchantInfo` and `requestIdObject` suggests significant customization or merchant-specific configuration.

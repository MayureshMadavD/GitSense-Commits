# Activity Summary for 01/09/2025

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/MerchantAPI.ts` file, last updated on 01/09/2025 at 12:12:20, is a TypeScript file containing numerous asynchronous functions for interacting with a merchant's API.  These functions handle various aspects of an e-commerce checkout process, including:

* **Cart Management:**  Functions like `getCartJs`, `getAbandonCart`, and `updateCartAnalytics` manage cart data, including retrieving cart details, handling abandoned carts, and updating cart analytics.  The `getRequestId` function is crucial for obtaining a request ID, possibly for tracking purposes.  Significant use of `originalCart` and manipulation based on `merchantInfo.mmData` and `requestIdObject` suggests handling of different cart representations or configurations.

* **User Authentication and Login:** `submitPhoneNumber`, `checkLogin`, `verifyOTP`, and `resendOtpCall` handle user authentication through phone number verification and token validation. The presence of `kwikpassToken` suggests integration with a third-party authentication system.  The functions include handling of various custom parameters, such as `cf_user_customer_id`, `cf_user_id`, `cf_dimension_id`, and `cf_session_id`, which likely come from a data layer for tracking and analytics.

* **Address Management:** `deleteAddress`, `verifyPincode`, `addAddress`, `getAllAddress`, and `editAddress` manage user addresses, covering actions like adding, deleting, verifying pincodes, and retrieving all addresses.  Error handling is present in `editAddress` for missing 'aid' parameter.

* **Experimentation and Personalization:** `getUserExperiments` and `assignUserVariant` interact with an experimentation service to retrieve and assign user variants for A/B testing or personalized experiences.

* **Payment and Offers:** The code uses numerous variables related to payment methods, discounts (`store_offers`, `store_stackedDiscounts`, etc.), and offers, indicating a system for managing payment options and promotional offers.

The code heavily relies on a store-like system using variables subscribed to observable stores (`store_...`). This suggests a reactive programming pattern using a state management library.  The functions extensively use `getBody` to construct API request bodies, consistently including parameters such as `mid`, `os_type`, and `request_id`.  Error handling is minimal, mostly relying on try/catch blocks within an asynchronous queue processing mechanism (`apiRequestProcessingQueue`). The use of `x-gokwik-token` and other custom headers indicates the usage of authentication tokens and custom headers.  The presence of several functions related to handling and modification of cart objects based on `merchantInfo` and `requestIdObject` suggests significant customization or merchant-specific configuration.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/tax-settings/taxOverride.tsx` on January 9th, 2025.  The file is a React component responsible for managing tax overrides.  Key changes include:

* **12:56:07:** Initial commit of the `TaxOverride` component.  This version includes a form for adding tax overrides with fields for "Tax Override For?", "Collection", "State", "Tax Type", and "Tax Rate (%)".  It also uses a table to display existing overrides and allows for their removal. The component fetches Shopify collections via `fetchShopifyCollectionsOrProducts`.  A `debounce` function is used to control the rate of API calls.

* **12:56:49 - 13:01:19 (multiple minor revisions):** These revisions primarily involved adding or removing `console.log` statements for debugging purposes within the `fetchCollections` function, which retrieves and updates the list of Shopify collections displayed in the component's form.  The logs track the search text, the API response, and the updated collections state.  There were no functional changes to the component's logic during this period.

* **13:06:01 - 13:08:44 (multiple minor revisions):**  Further debugging using `console.log` statements to track the filtering and merging of collections data within the `fetchCollections` function.  A log shows the array before and after filtering/merging.

* **13:12:12 - 13:12:34:** A `console.log` statement displaying the `collections` state was moved outside of the `fetchCollections` function to show the final state of the collection data.

* **13:17:03 - 13:17:58:**  A significant change was made in the `fetchCollections` function.  The API call is now conditionally triggered only if the search text has at least 3 characters.  Also, `filterOption` is set to `false` in the collection select input's `inputProps`.  Emptying the collections state (`setCollections([])`) before the API call is added, ensuring the collection list is cleared before fetching new data.

Throughout the log, the component consistently utilizes the `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and demonstrates a pattern of using `useCallback`, `useState`, and `useRef` hooks for managing state and side effects. The component also includes robust filtering and data handling for states and tax types.  The primary focus of the changes seems to be refining the collection fetching and display logic.

# Activity Summary for 04/09/2025

## 19:54:38
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`  between 19:24:13 and 19:48:59 on 04/09/2025.  These updates primarily involve modifications to the component's script section, adding and refining logic related to discount application, management, and display.  The changes significantly expand the handling of various discount types, including automatic discounts, stacked discounts, loyalty programs, gift cards, and partner offers (like Cred).  There's a heavy reliance on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state.  The code extensively uses asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for API calls related to discount retrieval and application.  The component interacts with various services, including `Discounts.service`, `WalletCredits.service`, `ShippingDiscount.service`, and `MerchantAPI`.  The consistent pattern across all edits is the expansion and refinement of discount logic.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated once at 19:19:30 on 04/09/2025. This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs and CDN paths based on the current environment (e.g., 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production').  The significant change is the comprehensive mapping of environment variables to different API endpoints, suggesting a robust and versatile approach to handling different deployment environments.  The code also includes logic to handle the `local` environment, potentially for local development and testing purposes.
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` was updated twice, at 19:40:56 and 19:41:08. These updates primarily involve additions to the `onMount` function, enhancing the handling of events and data received from an iframe, likely for communication with a parent application. The code manages various aspects of the checkout process, including receiving launch data, handling different payment methods, and updating application state based on events and data from external sources.  There is a notable emphasis on managing cookies and local storage, particularly for authentication tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`). The updates to this file suggest enhancements in data synchronization and integration between the application and external systems.


## 19:54:59
The log shows numerous revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`  between 17:11:33 and 18:33:13 on 04/09/2025.  The changes primarily focus on refining the handling of line items, particularly concerning adding and deleting items, and implementing discount functionality.

Initially, the code lacked the `properties_hash` field in the `lineItems` array. This was added around 17:18:09 to improve the identification and management of individual product variations, especially when re-adding deleted items.  The `handleReAddItem` function was modified several times (around 17:49:11, 17:52:08, 17:56:49, 18:00:10, 18:06:47, 18:10:00, 18:10:27, 18:20:16, 18:20:33, 18:25:08, 18:26:18, 18:28:59, 18:30:46, and 18:31:47) to incorporate `properties_hash`  into the comparison logic, preventing duplicate entries. The additions of `console.log` statements in various iterations suggest debugging efforts during this process.

Around 18:01:48 and subsequent commits, the `recentlyDeletedItems` array within the `discount` state was modified to also include the `properties_hash` to ensure accurate re-addition.

Another significant change occurred around 18:20:16, where the mapping in `recentlyDeletedData` and `data` useMemo functions was updated to correctly handle potential null values for fields like `p_name`, `sku`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`, and `product_thumbnail_url` within the `item` objects.  The addition of optional chaining (`?.`) addresses potential errors caused by these null values.  Further refinements in the conditional logic for `handleReAddItem` between 18:25:08 and 18:33:13 improved the prevention of adding duplicate line items based on both `variant_id` and `properties_hash`.

In summary, the majority of changes involved enhancing the data handling and preventing issues arising from potential null values and the need to distinctly identify products based on their properties.  The development process demonstrates an iterative approach to problem-solving, with the developer using `console.log` extensively for debugging purposes.

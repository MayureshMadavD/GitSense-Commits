# Activity Summary for 04/09/2025

## 19:54:38
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`  between 19:24:13 and 19:48:59 on 04/09/2025.  These updates primarily involve modifications to the component's script section, adding and refining logic related to discount application, management, and display.  The changes significantly expand the handling of various discount types, including automatic discounts, stacked discounts, loyalty programs, gift cards, and partner offers (like Cred).  There's a heavy reliance on Svelte stores (`store_...`) for managing application state.  The code extensively uses asynchronous operations (`async/await`) for API calls related to discount retrieval and application.  The component interacts with various services, including `Discounts.service`, `WalletCredits.service`, `ShippingDiscount.service`, and `MerchantAPI`.  The consistent pattern across all edits is the expansion and refinement of discount logic.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated once at 19:19:30 on 04/09/2025. This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs and CDN paths based on the current environment (e.g., 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production').  The significant change is the comprehensive mapping of environment variables to different API endpoints, suggesting a robust and versatile approach to handling different deployment environments.  The code also includes logic to handle the `local` environment, potentially for local development and testing purposes.
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` was updated twice, at 19:40:56 and 19:41:08. These updates primarily involve additions to the `onMount` function, enhancing the handling of events and data received from an iframe, likely for communication with a parent application. The code manages various aspects of the checkout process, including receiving launch data, handling different payment methods, and updating application state based on events and data from external sources.  There is a notable emphasis on managing cookies and local storage, particularly for authentication tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`). The updates to this file suggest enhancements in data synchronization and integration between the application and external systems.

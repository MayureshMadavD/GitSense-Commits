# Activity Summary for 15/09/2025

## 19:13:34
The log shows several code changes across multiple files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` project, primarily focused on environment configuration, checkout UI elements, and various store management.  The most significant changes were made between 18:32:04 and 18:52:06 on 15/09/2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (15/09/2025, 18:32:04): This file defines functions to retrieve base URLs for various APIs based on the current environment ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.).  It heavily uses conditional logic to determine the appropriate URL for each API endpoint. It also manages tokens (XGokwikToken, XKWIKPASSToken) based on the environment. A noteworthy aspect is the extensive handling of different environment variables and corresponding API endpoints.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (15/09/2025, 18:32:31): This HTML file sets up a merchant page with a form to input merchant ID and JSON data. JavaScript code manages saving and loading this data using cookies and handles communication with a Gokwik SDK (`gokwik.js`), potentially initiating a checkout process. It also includes cookie management for tracking landing page and referrer.  The script also displays a Privy widget for marketing promotions.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/MobilePhoneInput.svelte` (15/09/2025, 18:43:46):  This Svelte component handles mobile phone number input and validation. It interacts with multiple stores (e.g., `store_phoneNo`, `store_disableContinueButton`), makes API calls (`submitPhoneNumber`), and fires various events.  The component incorporates error handling and conditional logic based on different application states.  There is extensive interaction with several stores across multiple files.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/App.svelte` (15/09/2025, 18:45:13, 18:52:06, 19:02:43): This is the main application component, orchestrating the checkout flow. It manages the current page using the `store_page` variable and conditionally renders different components (e.g., `MobilePhoneInput`, `PaymentOptions`, `Address`). It handles inter-component communication, message events from iFrames (`window.addEventListener('message', ...)`), and various store subscriptions and updates. Multiple updates to this file suggest a significant refactoring and addition of features related to checkout management and error handling across multiple stages of the checkout flow.  A substantial amount of code is dedicated to managing and using various stores and handling message events.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Interfaces.ts` (15/09/2025, 18:49:05):  This file defines type interfaces used across the application, such as `LaunchData`, `cartInterface`, `MerchantInfoInterface`, etc., which are essential for the structure and communication within the application. Defines various interfaces for data structures used in the application.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/stores/CommonStore.ts` (15/09/2025, 18:50:52, 18:51:02): This file declares Svelte writable stores (`writable`) that hold application state, such as cart data (`store_cartjsObject`), merchant information (`store_merchantInfo`), and various flags controlling the UI.  The stores are used by multiple components to share and manage application state.  The minor edit between the two timestamps is insignificant.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/trustBanner.svelte` (15/09/2025, 19:03:31, 19:04:12): This component likely displays a trust banner. The initial version was empty, subsequently updated to include a simple `<div>`, indicating potential work in progress or placeholder content.  The changes are minimal and likely reflect a work-in-progress state.


In summary, the codebase focuses on a checkout system with extensive environment management, numerous Svelte components, intricate store interactions, and robust error handling.  The numerous API calls suggest interaction with a backend system for order processing and various other functionalities.  The updates mostly center around refining the checkout flow and improving error handling.

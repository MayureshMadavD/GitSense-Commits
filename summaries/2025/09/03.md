# Activity Summary for 03/09/2025

## 16:45:38
The log shows code changes primarily focused on `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`  on March 9th, 2025.  There are two nearly identical commits to this file, separated by only a minute.  Both commits represent a substantial update to a React component responsible for configuring shipping methods.

The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements and interacts with a backend API (`makeAPICall`) for fetching customer segments, uploading and downloading CSV files related to pincodes and cohorts, and retrieving shipping details.  The code handles CSV file uploads to configure shipping based on pincodes, validating the format and using pre-signed URLs for AWS S3 uploads.  It also includes functionality for downloading pincode lists and displaying them.

The component manages form state using `Form.useForm()` from `gokwik-ui-kit` and Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) for accessing merchant details and customer segments.  Error handling is included via `message.error()` for various scenarios, such as incorrect file formats and API failures.  The code extensively uses functional components, hooks (e.g., `useEffect`, `useState`), and asynchronous operations.  There's significant logic for managing UI state (modals, switches, etc.), and form validation.  The component also includes advanced condition settings accessed via a modal and a tooltip for providing additional guidance to the user. The structure suggests a complex form for managing shipping configurations, including price, minimum and maximum order values, and advanced options for defining customer segments.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` file was updated on 03/09/2025, 17:03:19.  This component is a React component responsible for configuring shipping methods.  Key changes include:

* **Enhanced UI:** The component uses numerous components from `gokwik-ui-kit` (Alert, Button, Card, etc.) to create a form for configuring shipping prices, including fields for shipping name, price, minimum and maximum order values.  It also incorporates advanced conditionality via modals and a CSV upload feature for pincodes and cohorts.

* **Form Handling:** The code uses `Form.useForm()` from `gokwik-ui-kit` for form management, including validation rules (e.g., ensuring the shipping name is unique and less than 16 characters).  It uses `useWatch` to track form changes.

* **API Interactions:** The component makes API calls using `makeAPICall` to fetch customer segments, upload CSV data (pincodes and cohorts) to a server (using pre-signed URLs), and download CSV files. The API endpoints are defined in `APIEndPoints`.  Error handling is included for API requests.  The code suggests interaction with an AWS S3-like service for file uploads.

* **Data Management:**  The component manages state using `useState` for various UI elements (modals, switches, editing status, uploaded files) and data (shipping configurations, customer segments).  It uses `useSelector` from `react-redux` to access merchant details from the Redux store.  The `deepCompare` helper function suggests efficient comparison of complex data structures.

* **File Uploads:**  A CSV upload feature allows users to upload pincodes or cohorts.  The component handles file validation (checking for `.csv` type) and provides visual feedback (using `Upload` component).  Error handling is implemented for incorrect file formats and upload failures.  The code includes client-side validation of CSV data format (checking for horizontal or vertical layouts).

* **Helper Functions:** Several helper functions are used: `formatAmount`, `getFutureDateString`, `uploadCohortCsv`, `downloadFromURL`, `downloadToCSV`, and custom functions for API calls and data processing.


The overall update significantly enhances the shipping configuration functionality with a more robust UI, improved form handling, and comprehensive error handling for API interactions and file uploads.  The use of pre-signed URLs for file uploads suggests a secure implementation. The code's structure is well-organized, utilizing React hooks effectively.


## 18:45:40
The provided log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` on March 9th, 2025, between 17:48:30 and 17:48:45.  These updates appear to be minor, with no substantial code changes across the three commits. The file contains a collection of utility functions, including:

* **Date and Number Formatting:** Functions like `formatDateString`, `formatAmount`, and `formatNumber` handle date and number formatting for different locales (en-GB, en-IN).
* **Data Manipulation:** Functions for dynamic search filters (`getDynamicSearchFilters`), deep comparison (`deepCompare`), CSV upload and validation (`uploadCohortCsv`), array field comparison (`compareAndCaptureArrayFields`), and data sorting (`sortDataByKey`).
* **Helper Functions:**  Functions for debouncing (`debounce`), disabling dates/times based on current time (`disabledBeforeDate`, `disabledBeforeTime`, `disabledDate`, `disabledTime`), capitalizing strings (`capitalizeFirstLetter`), and extracting titles and data indexes from columns (`extractTitlesAndDataIndexes`).

The timestamps indicate a rapid succession of commits, possibly reflecting iterative development or bug fixes. There are no recurring patterns or significant structural changes evident within these commits; the changes seem to focus on refining existing functions.


A separate change was made to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` at 17:57:51 on the same day. This file is an EJS template, likely used for generating HTML for the dashboard UI. The key update here is the conditional inclusion of `<script>` tags based on the `deployedEnv` variable (dev, qa, sandbox, production).  These scripts define import maps for different environments, specifying URLs for various Gokwik modules (configuration, utilities, dashboard, checkout, payment, etc.).  The production environment also includes Clarity and New Relic monitoring scripts, demonstrating a clear distinction between development and production configurations.

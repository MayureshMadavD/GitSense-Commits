The log shows code changes primarily focused on `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`  on March 9th, 2025.  There are two nearly identical commits to this file, separated by only a minute.  Both commits represent a substantial update to a React component responsible for configuring shipping methods.

The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements and interacts with a backend API (`makeAPICall`) for fetching customer segments, uploading and downloading CSV files related to pincodes and cohorts, and retrieving shipping details.  The code handles CSV file uploads to configure shipping based on pincodes, validating the format and using pre-signed URLs for AWS S3 uploads.  It also includes functionality for downloading pincode lists and displaying them.

The component manages form state using `Form.useForm()` from `gokwik-ui-kit` and Redux (`useSelector`, `useAppDispatch`) for accessing merchant details and customer segments.  Error handling is included via `message.error()` for various scenarios, such as incorrect file formats and API failures.  The code extensively uses functional components, hooks (e.g., `useEffect`, `useState`), and asynchronous operations.  There's significant logic for managing UI state (modals, switches, etc.), and form validation.  The component also includes advanced condition settings accessed via a modal and a tooltip for providing additional guidance to the user. The structure suggests a complex form for managing shipping configurations, including price, minimum and maximum order values, and advanced options for defining customer segments.

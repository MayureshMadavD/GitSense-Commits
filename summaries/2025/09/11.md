# Activity Summary for 11/09/2025

## 13:20:15
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` on October 9, 2025.  The file is a Svelte component dealing with merchant checkout integration, heavily using cookies and local storage.  The code manages various analytics integrations (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics) and handles UPI payment app availability checks.

The major changes across the revisions are subtle.  Early revisions (22:24:31, 22:25:20, 22:25:43, 22:25:53) show minor formatting and possibly linting adjustments, with inconsistent spacing around `checkoutAnywhere` and other variables.  The final revision (22:37:28) is more significant:

*   `XGokwikToken` is removed from imports, indicating a potential refactoring of token management.
*   The `getGkCookieArray` function seems to have been removed, implying the token retrieval logic has been modified.
* The `sp_duid` variable in `setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad` now defaults to an empty string instead of `null`.
*  The `launchApp` function's implementation is truncated in all entries, making it impossible to fully analyze its modifications.

Throughout the revisions, the core functionality of handling merchant information,  processing cookies (`_shopify_s`, `_scid`, `gk_utm_source`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, etc.), and integrating with various analytics platforms remains consistent. The repeated use of `window.merchantInfo` suggests this object is a crucial data source. The code's reliance on cookies for various data points and  the handling of different environments (local, dev, production, sandbox, qa, qatwo) are also recurring themes.  The `truecallerConfig` object shows different API keys for different environments.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/tax-settings/taxOverride.tsx` between 22:54:37 and 23:08:10 on October 9, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the `checkIfOverrideExists` function. Initially, this function included a `console.log` statement for debugging purposes, which was subsequently removed.  The core logic of the function, which checks for existing tax overrides based on various criteria (override type, product/collection ID, tax type, value, and state/UT), underwent several iterations to improve accuracy and handle different scenarios (e.g., "All States" or "All UTs").  A seemingly unintentional `return` statement within `onFormFinish` was also corrected.  The final version removes the `override.value === values.value` condition, allowing the addition of overrides with the same tax rate as existing overrides. There were no changes in other files except for the `.gitignore` file, which was updated to include `.env`, and  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` which had several updates across different timestamps.  The  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file shows configurations for different environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production), with conditional loading of Javascript files based on the environment.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/setup/index.tsx` file also shows changes focusing on improving discount validation and handling of minimum purchase requirements. These changes were spread across multiple timestamps between 13:15:01 and 13:25:57 on November 9, 2025, with a focus on improving the user experience and data validation in the discount setup form.  A `ProductSearch` component was also updated to handle different search types (`products` or `collections`) and collation of products.

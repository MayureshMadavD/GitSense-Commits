# Activity Summary for 11/09/2025

## 13:20:15
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` on October 9, 2025.  The file is a Svelte component dealing with merchant checkout integration, heavily using cookies and local storage.  The code manages various analytics integrations (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics) and handles UPI payment app availability checks.

The major changes across the revisions are subtle.  Early revisions (22:24:31, 22:25:20, 22:25:43, 22:25:53) show minor formatting and possibly linting adjustments, with inconsistent spacing around `checkoutAnywhere` and other variables.  The final revision (22:37:28) is more significant:

*   `XGokwikToken` is removed from imports, indicating a potential refactoring of token management.
*   The `getGkCookieArray` function seems to have been removed, implying the token retrieval logic has been modified.
* The `sp_duid` variable in `setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad` now defaults to an empty string instead of `null`.
*  The `launchApp` function's implementation is truncated in all entries, making it impossible to fully analyze its modifications.

Throughout the revisions, the core functionality of handling merchant information,  processing cookies (`_shopify_s`, `_scid`, `gk_utm_source`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, etc.), and integrating with various analytics platforms remains consistent. The repeated use of `window.merchantInfo` suggests this object is a crucial data source. The code's reliance on cookies for various data points and  the handling of different environments (local, dev, production, sandbox, qa, qatwo) are also recurring themes.  The `truecallerConfig` object shows different API keys for different environments.


## 14:21:24
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/tax-settings/taxOverride.tsx` between 22:54:37 and 23:08:10 on October 9, 2025.  These revisions primarily focus on refining the `checkIfOverrideExists` function. Initially, this function included a `console.log` statement for debugging purposes, which was subsequently removed.  The core logic of the function, which checks for existing tax overrides based on various criteria (override type, product/collection ID, tax type, value, and state/UT), underwent several iterations to improve accuracy and handle different scenarios (e.g., "All States" or "All UTs").  A seemingly unintentional `return` statement within `onFormFinish` was also corrected.  The final version removes the `override.value === values.value` condition, allowing the addition of overrides with the same tax rate as existing overrides. There were no changes in other files except for the `.gitignore` file, which was updated to include `.env`, and  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/interface/interface.ts` which had several updates across different timestamps.  The  `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file shows configurations for different environments (dev, qa, sandbox, production), with conditional loading of Javascript files based on the environment.  The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/setup/index.tsx` file also shows changes focusing on improving discount validation and handling of minimum purchase requirements. These changes were spread across multiple timestamps between 13:15:01 and 13:25:57 on November 9, 2025, with a focus on improving the user experience and data validation in the discount setup form.  A `ProductSearch` component was also updated to handle different search types (`products` or `collections`) and collation of products.


## 20:26:04
The log shows a series of edits to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/checkoutelement.tsx` between 18:24:39 and 20:23:09 on November 9, 2025.  These edits primarily involve refinements to a React component responsible for checkout element customization.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements and interacts with an API (`makeAPICall`) for merchant configuration and logo uploads.

Notably, a significant change occurs around 18:26:51 with the addition of an import for `RenderField` from `@library/utilities/helpers/renderFormItem`. This suggests a refactoring to improve the rendering of form items. Subsequent changes (18:28:19, 18:28:36, 18:32:41, 18:33:00, 18:34:15) appear to be minor formatting or auto-save edits to the same file.  A further modification around 18:49:15 adds an import for `title` from `process`, the purpose of which is unclear without further context.  The final significant change at 20:18:59 and 20:19:04 incorporates the `TrustBadgeForm` component from `@library/components/trustBanner`, indicating the addition of trust badge settings to the checkout customization.

The  `checkoutelement.tsx` file consistently deals with:

* **Merchant configuration:**  Fetching and saving configurations using `useMerchantConfigApi`.
* **Logo uploads:** Handling logo uploads, validation, and API calls to fetch pre-signed URLs.
* **Form handling:** Using `Form.useForm`, `Form.useWatch` for managing form state.
* **UI elements:** Extensive use of components from `gokwik-ui-kit`.


The changes to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/trustBanner.tsx` between 20:15:02 and 20:24:51 show the development of a form for configuring trust badges.  The initial version (20:15:02) included a `Button` for adding icons, which was removed in a later commit (20:18:26).  The final version (20:24:51) refactors the component's structure by adding `span` properties to the fields, likely for layout purposes within a form.


The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-configuration/src/index.ejs` file shows configuration for a single-spa application setup, defining import maps for different environments (local, dev, qa, sandbox, production).  The production environment includes clarity and new relic code snippets.  There are no apparent changes to this file in the provided log.  The file's content suggests a microservices architecture with various Gokwik services.  The changes to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/utilities/helpers/helper.ts` are not relevant for summary as they don't directly impact the UI changes discussed above.

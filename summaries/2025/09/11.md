# Activity Summary for 11/09/2025

The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/merchant/Merchant.svelte` on October 9, 2025.  The file is a Svelte component dealing with merchant checkout integration, heavily using cookies and local storage.  The code manages various analytics integrations (CleverTap, Klaviyo, Wigzo, WebEngage, Moengage, Facebook, GA, Growlytics, Contlo, GA4, Netcore, Snapchat, CustomerLabs, ShopifyAnalytics) and handles UPI payment app availability checks.

The major changes across the revisions are subtle.  Early revisions (22:24:31, 22:25:20, 22:25:43, 22:25:53) show minor formatting and possibly linting adjustments, with inconsistent spacing around `checkoutAnywhere` and other variables.  The final revision (22:37:28) is more significant:

*   `XGokwikToken` is removed from imports, indicating a potential refactoring of token management.
*   The `getGkCookieArray` function seems to have been removed, implying the token retrieval logic has been modified.
* The `sp_duid` variable in `setCookiesOnCheckoutLoad` now defaults to an empty string instead of `null`.
*  The `launchApp` function's implementation is truncated in all entries, making it impossible to fully analyze its modifications.

Throughout the revisions, the core functionality of handling merchant information,  processing cookies (`_shopify_s`, `_scid`, `gk_utm_source`, `_fbp`, `_fbc`, etc.), and integrating with various analytics platforms remains consistent. The repeated use of `window.merchantInfo` suggests this object is a crucial data source. The code's reliance on cookies for various data points and  the handling of different environments (local, dev, production, sandbox, qa, qatwo) are also recurring themes.  The `truecallerConfig` object shows different API keys for different environments.

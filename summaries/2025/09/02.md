# Activity Summary for 02/09/2025

## 00:42:32
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/TotalContainer.svelte` file underwent three revisions on January 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the display and calculation of discounts within the order summary.

The first revision (23:36:01) introduced the component's initial structure, handling various discount types (coupon, automatic, loyalty, special, prepaid), gift card application, and  MRP (Maximum Retail Price) information.  It includes extensive logic for calculating `totalOrderDiscount` and `totalGiftCardAmount`, leveraging several Svelte stores for data.  A `logEvent` function is used to track payment method discrepancies.

The second revision (23:38:18) involved a minor change: a `console.log(JSON.stringify($store_discountBasedRewards))` statement was added after the `<li class="subtotal">` element, seemingly for debugging purposes.  This suggests the developer was investigating issues related to  `store_discountBasedRewards`.

The third revision (23:40:08) replaced the debugging statement from the second revision with `JSON.stringify($store_partnerAcquisitionOffer)`. This further points to the ongoing debugging of discount calculations, now focusing on the `store_partnerAcquisitionOffer` store. The overall structure and logic of the component remained unchanged across all three revisions.  The timestamps indicate rapid iteration and debugging in a short time frame.  The recurring theme across all versions is the complex calculation and display of multiple discount types and gift card amounts, reflecting a potentially intricate pricing model.

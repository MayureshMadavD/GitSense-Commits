# Activity Summary for 02/09/2025

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/TotalContainer.svelte` file underwent three revisions on January 9th, 2025.  The changes primarily focused on the display and calculation of discounts within the order summary.

The first revision (23:36:01) introduced the component's initial structure, handling various discount types (coupon, automatic, loyalty, special, prepaid), gift card application, and  MRP (Maximum Retail Price) information.  It includes extensive logic for calculating `totalOrderDiscount` and `totalGiftCardAmount`, leveraging several Svelte stores for data.  A `logEvent` function is used to track payment method discrepancies.

The second revision (23:38:18) involved a minor change: a `console.log(JSON.stringify($store_discountBasedRewards))` statement was added after the `<li class="subtotal">` element, seemingly for debugging purposes.  This suggests the developer was investigating issues related to  `store_discountBasedRewards`.

The third revision (23:40:08) replaced the debugging statement from the second revision with `JSON.stringify($store_partnerAcquisitionOffer)`. This further points to the ongoing debugging of discount calculations, now focusing on the `store_partnerAcquisitionOffer` store. The overall structure and logic of the component remained unchanged across all three revisions.  The timestamps indicate rapid iteration and debugging in a short time frame.  The recurring theme across all versions is the complex calculation and display of multiple discount types and gift card amounts, reflecting a potentially intricate pricing model.

This commit significantly updates the `/Users/madav/Documents/mint-dashboard/app/ui/dashboard/merchants/merchant.jsx` file on 02/09/2025 at 01:04:13.  The changes involve a major overhaul of a React component responsible for displaying and managing merchant data.

The component, `Merchant`, now uses Ant Design components extensively for its UI elements (Buttons, Forms, Tables, Modals, etc.).  It incorporates several custom functions for data manipulation and filtering (`convertStringtoArray`, `createOptionsListForFilter`, `exportDataToCsv`, etc.) and interacts with backend functions for creating, updating, and deleting merchant entries (`createNewMerchant`, `deletEntryForMerchant`, `updateMerchantByID`).

The core functionality revolves around a table displaying merchant information, allowing for filtering, sorting, and pagination.  The displayed columns are configurable, and the component supports adding and editing merchants via forms.  A significant portion of the code is dedicated to defining the structure and validation rules for this form, covering numerous merchant attributes (name, CE name, type, dates, ARR, etc.).  The component also includes delete confirmation modals and utilizes various Ant Design components for enhanced UI.  Finally, filtering is implemented using both text search and numerical/date range filters.

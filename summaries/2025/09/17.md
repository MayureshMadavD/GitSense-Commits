# Activity Summary for 17/09/2025

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`  between 11:48:01 and 12:11:02 on September 17, 2025.  The changes primarily involve a React component (`ShippingMethodConfig`) handling shipping configuration.  There are no functional changes between revisions, only the addition of `[shippingConfig]` to the `useEffect` dependency array at 12:05:08 and 12:09:19.  This ensures the `setShippingConfig` function is called whenever `shippingConfig` changes.  Before this, the component only updated on initial render.

The component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library extensively for UI elements and interacts with an API (`makeAPICall`) for fetching customer segments and handling CSV uploads/downloads related to shipping pincodes and cohorts.  The code includes functions for:

* **Fetching customer segments:** `getCustomerSegement` retrieves customer segments from the store using Redux.
* **Handling CSV uploads:** `requestForShippingModule` and `uploadCsvData` handle uploading CSV data to an AWS S3-like service, using presigned URLs.  Error handling is incorporated for incorrect file formats and upload failures.
* **Handling CSV downloads:** `downloadCsvFile` downloads a CSV file from a given URL.
* **Fetching pincode lists:** `fetchPincodeList` retrieves a list of pincodes for a given shipping UUID.

The `fields` array defines a form structure using the `Form` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`, managing inputs for shipping name, price, minimum and maximum order values.  A button triggers a modal for "Advanced Conditions."  The component includes input validation using `rules` within the `fields` array, including a check for duplicate shipping names.  Finally, an upload component (`Inputs`) allows users to upload CSV files, providing visual feedback and a delete option.

The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx` between 12:12 PM and 12:49 PM on September 17, 2025.  The core functionality remains consistent throughoutâ€”managing shipping configurations with features like adding, editing, and deleting shipping methods.  The most significant change appears to be in the `useEffect` hook's dependency array. Initially, it included `shippingConfig` (causing re-renders on shipping config updates), but later revisions removed or re-added this dependency, potentially impacting the component's update behavior.  No other substantial structural alterations were observed.  The code consistently uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and interacts with API endpoints (`APIEndPoints`) for fetching customer segments and managing shipping-related data via CSV uploads and downloads.  There's also consistent handling of pincode data using a CSV upload mechanism and validation.  Specific modifications within the large `fields` array appear minor, involving minor adjustments to the UI and validation rules.

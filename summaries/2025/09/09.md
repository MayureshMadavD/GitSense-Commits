The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte` on August 9th and September 9th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent two revisions on August 9th, 2025, at 22:25:48 and 22:30:09.  These revisions appear to involve updates to the logic determining base URLs for various APIs (health service, address suggestion, general API, Cred URL, experiment, Twidpay API, KP API) and CDN paths based on the current environment ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.).  The primary change between the two revisions seems to be a modification in the `local` environment URL within the `api_url` function, changing it from other URLs (commented out) to  `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte` was modified multiple times on September 9th, 2025 between 11:44:38 and 12:51:44.  These changes primarily involve refinements to the `onMount` asynchronous function.  The most significant change is the addition of `store_shippingOptionsResponse` to the import statement and the conditional check `$store_shippingOptionsResponse?.length` before calling `callPaymentMethods` within the `if (!$store_placeOrder)` block. This suggests an improvement in how payment methods are handled depending on the availability of shipping options.  Other minor updates seem to involve adjustments to the handling of various payment methods (UPI, cards, COD, etc.), A/B testing flags (`fetchVariants` calls for various experiments), and error handling.  The extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) suggests a reactive approach to updating the UI based on application state.

# Activity Summary for 09/09/2025

## 13:07:49
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte` on August 9th and September 9th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent two revisions on August 9th, 2025, at 22:25:48 and 22:30:09.  These revisions appear to involve updates to the logic determining base URLs for various APIs (health service, address suggestion, general API, Cred URL, experiment, Twidpay API, KP API) and CDN paths based on the current environment ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', etc.).  The primary change between the two revisions seems to be a modification in the `local` environment URL within the `api_url` function, changing it from other URLs (commented out) to  `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/PaymentOptions.svelte` was modified multiple times on September 9th, 2025 between 11:44:38 and 12:51:44.  These changes primarily involve refinements to the `onMount` asynchronous function.  The most significant change is the addition of `store_shippingOptionsResponse` to the import statement and the conditional check `$store_shippingOptionsResponse?.length` before calling `callPaymentMethods` within the `if (!$store_placeOrder)` block. This suggests an improvement in how payment methods are handled depending on the availability of shipping options.  Other minor updates seem to involve adjustments to the handling of various payment methods (UPI, cards, COD, etc.), A/B testing flags (`fetchVariants` calls for various experiments), and error handling.  The extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) suggests a reactive approach to updating the UI based on application state.


## 17:25:29
The log shows multiple updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` directory between 16:25:23 and 17:21:25 on 09/09/2025.  The most significant changes involve the `EnvironmentService.ts` file and the `WalletCredits.svelte` component.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice within a minute (16:25:23 and 16:26:30).  These updates appear to be minor and do not affect the core functionality of the service, which is to provide base URLs for various APIs based on the current environment (dev, qa, sandbox, production, etc.). The changes might involve adjustments to API endpoints or minor bug fixes.

The `WalletCredits.svelte` component underwent several revisions (16:34:56, 16:35:50, 16:36:31, 16:37:14, 16:38:11, 16:38:48, 17:14:47, 17:16:37, 17:21:25).  These changes primarily focus on refining the UI for displaying and managing wallet credits and loyalty points.  The conditional rendering logic was adjusted multiple times, likely improving the handling of different states (e.g., credits applied, credits available, discounts applied). The component also includes logic to interact with various stores using Svelte's reactive declarations (`$:`), managing the application and removal of credits, and displaying a modal if discounts cannot be combined with loyalty points.  A significant change is the addition of  `EarnedLoyalty` component to display earned loyalty points.  The final change (17:21:25) refined the display of earned loyalty points relative to applicable credits.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/EarnedLoyalty.svelte` file was updated twice (16:32:25 and 16:32:59) with minimal changes, likely related to minor UI refinements or corrections. The changes mostly involved removal of extra spaces in the markup.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file was updated twice (16:40:32 and 16:41:33) with substantial changes, indicating a significant refactoring or enhancement of the discount logic and UI.  This file manages a considerable amount of state related to discounts, loyalty points, and other offers, highlighting the complexity of checkout discount management.  The changes likely involved improvements to how different discount types are handled and displayed, particularly regarding stacked discounts and the interaction with loyalty points.


A recurring pattern is the extensive use of Svelte stores (`store_...`) to manage application state and the frequent use of conditional rendering based on the state of these stores. This suggests a reactive and component-based architecture.  The frequent updates to `WalletCredits.svelte` point towards active development and iterative improvement of the checkout UI's reward and discount system.

The log shows updates to two files on September 9th, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated at 17:39:32.  This file is an HTML page containing a merchant interface.  The update includes significant JavaScript code for handling merchant information, including functions for initializing a GoKwik SDK, processing payments (`processPayment`), managing events (`on`, `emit`),  handling cookies (`getCookieGk`, `setCookieGk`), and interacting with a checkout button. The script interacts with various URLs including `http://localhost:8080/build/gokwik.js` and several GoKwik API endpoints (dev, sandbox, QA, prod).  The HTML also features a form for inputting Merchant ID and JSON data, allowing the user to save this data to cookies.  A select element is present to choose between different environments (Dev, Sandbox, QA, Prod). The page also embeds a Privy widget.  A notable element is the hardcoded merchant IDs within the JavaScript, suggesting a need for improved configuration management.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` was updated twice, at 17:39:50 and 17:41:26. This TypeScript file defines functions for retrieving base URLs for various services based on the environment (dev, sandbox, qa, production, and several others).  The `env` variable, sourced from a store, determines the appropriate URL.  The updates primarily involved changes within the `setCart` function, which updates a cart object in a store with different cart data containing product information. The second update modifies the cart data's token and attributes.  The file also includes functions to retrieve URLs for different API endpoints (health, address suggestions, API, Cred, experiments, Twidpay, KP, analytics), CDN paths, and merchant URLs, along with functions for generating tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`). The code suggests a complex system with multiple environments and a need for consistent URL management based on environment variables.  The frequent changes in the `setCart` function within a short time frame indicate active development or debugging related to cart data management.

# Activity Summary for 22/09/2025

## 13:31:53
The log shows multiple updates to Svelte components and service files related to a GoKwik checkout UI, primarily focused on address input and discount handling.  Significant changes occurred around 12:43 PM, 12:49 PM, and 12:59 PM on September 22, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (12:43:58): This file manages environment-specific API URLs and token generation.  It contains functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health check, address suggestion, etc.) based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  It also defines functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which vary based on the environment.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with sample data, suggesting this is used for development/testing purposes.  The code shows extensive handling for numerous different environments.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (12:44:20): This is an HTML file representing a merchant page. It includes a form for entering merchant ID and JSON input, environment selection, and a button to initiate checkout.  JavaScript code handles saving data to cookies, interacting with a GoKwik SDK (`gokwikSdk`), and managing environment-specific URLs.  The code suggests the functionality of saving and loading data from cookies for merchant information.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts` (12:49:19 and 13:00:30): This file manages discount logic. It uses various Svelte stores to track cart data, offers, payment methods, and discount codes. Key functions include `discountCall` (makes API calls to apply/remove discounts), `getAvailableOffers` (fetches available offers based on address and other parameters), and `callBestDiscountOffer`.  The code extensively interacts with API endpoints for discount related actions, applying and removing discounts based on different parameters and scenarios.  There's significant logic for handling various discount types and scenarios, including automatic discounts and offer filtering based on experimental variations. The second update at 13:00:30 appears to be a minor edit, without noticeable functional changes.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` (12:51:55, 12:55:01, 12:55:07, 12:59:42): This Svelte component handles address input fields.  The code is complex and includes significant logic for handling address input, validation, and interaction with various stores (e.g., `store_selectedAddress`, `store_pincode`). There are multiple updates to this file, primarily involving refinements and conditional logic around handling additional address fields based on flags like `$store_additionalAddress` and `$store_addressSuggestionFlow`, as well as adjustments related to billing addresses and KwikPass login flows.  The repeated updates suggest iterative development and bug fixing within the address input handling.  The final update at 12:59:42  appears to be a minor edit, similar to the Discounts.service change.


The overall pattern in the changes is a focus on refining the checkout UI's functionality around address input and discount application, with multiple iterations suggesting ongoing development and testing. The numerous environment-specific URLs and token configurations indicate a need for supporting various stages of deployment (development, testing, production).


## 19:31:48
The provided log shows several updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/bulk-discounts/createBulkDiscounts.tsx` file between 19:24:12 and 19:30:11 on September 22, 2025.  These changes primarily involve adjustments to the `InputNumber` component's `max` prop within a React form. Initially, the `max` value for the 'Code length' field was 40, then it was changed to 20, and finally reverted back to 40.  No other significant functional changes are observed across these revisions.

Separately, there's a log entry for `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/generateCodes.tsx` at 19:31:22 on September 22, 2025.  This file contains a React component for generating discount codes, offering options for generating random codes or uploading a CSV file. The component includes features like a sample CSV download, code length validation, prefix/suffix input, and expiry date selection. It also displays the available discount code generation limit for the month.  This log entry represents a distinct component and its functionality, not directly related to the previous modifications.


## 20:31:47
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated on 22/09/2025 at 20:15:43.  The update primarily involved modifying functions that determine base URLs for various APIs and services based on the current environment (`env`).  These functions (`getHealthServiceBaseUrl`, `getAddressSuggestionBaseUrl`, `api_url`, `getCredUrl`, `experiment_url`, `twidpay_api`, `kp_api`, `cdn_path`, `analytics_api`, `analytics_api_v2`, `merchant_url`, `merchant_url_api`)  return different URLs depending on whether the environment is `dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, or other specific environments like `local`, `hdev`, `ndev`, `idev`, `qa-rto`, `qaone`, `qatwo`,  `pci-prod`.  The code also includes functions to retrieve tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`)  that vary based on the environment. A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with sample data, seemingly for local development purposes.  The significant change is the extensive mapping of environment variables to different API endpoints, suggesting a refactoring to handle multiple environments and improve configuration management.  The code uses a subscription mechanism to update variables based on changes to the `store_environment`, `store_merchanturl`, and `store_cashToPrepaid` objects, indicating reactive programming.


## 20:31:49
The code changes primarily involve the `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/discounts/generateCodes.tsx` file, which is a React component for generating discount codes.  The modifications span from 19:33:19 to 19:50:06 on 22/09/2025.

The initial version (19:33:19) shows a basic implementation for generating discount codes, including functionalities for random code generation and CSV file upload.  It fetches available limits based on merchant ID and includes input fields for code length, expiry date, and prefix/suffix.

A significant change occurred between 19:33:19 and 19:35:54. The `codeLength` input's maximum value was dynamically adjusted based on the `merchant_details?.m_id`.  Specifically,  if `merchant_details?.m_id` equals '19g6ilnczmpgl', the maximum code length is set to 40; otherwise, it remains 20.  This suggests a per-merchant customization for code length.

The final change (19:49:50 and 19:50:06) involved a minor addition of logging the `merchant_details?.m_id` to the console. No functional changes were introduced in these last two commits.

Throughout the updates, the component consistently uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library for UI elements and interacts with backend APIs (`makeAPICall`) for tasks like fetching pre-signed URLs for discount code downloads and getting the available discount code limit.  The code consistently handles error states and provides user feedback through messages.  The design emphasizes user experience with clear instructions for uploading CSV files and generating discount codes.

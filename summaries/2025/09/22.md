# Activity Summary for 22/09/2025

## 13:31:53
The log shows multiple updates to Svelte components and service files related to a GoKwik checkout UI, primarily focused on address input and discount handling.  Significant changes occurred around 12:43 PM, 12:49 PM, and 12:59 PM on September 22, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (12:43:58): This file manages environment-specific API URLs and token generation.  It contains functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health check, address suggestion, etc.) based on the current environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, etc.).  It also defines functions to generate tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) which vary based on the environment.  A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with sample data, suggesting this is used for development/testing purposes.  The code shows extensive handling for numerous different environments.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (12:44:20): This is an HTML file representing a merchant page. It includes a form for entering merchant ID and JSON input, environment selection, and a button to initiate checkout.  JavaScript code handles saving data to cookies, interacting with a GoKwik SDK (`gokwikSdk`), and managing environment-specific URLs.  The code suggests the functionality of saving and loading data from cookies for merchant information.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/Discounts.service.ts` (12:49:19 and 13:00:30): This file manages discount logic. It uses various Svelte stores to track cart data, offers, payment methods, and discount codes. Key functions include `discountCall` (makes API calls to apply/remove discounts), `getAvailableOffers` (fetches available offers based on address and other parameters), and `callBestDiscountOffer`.  The code extensively interacts with API endpoints for discount related actions, applying and removing discounts based on different parameters and scenarios.  There's significant logic for handling various discount types and scenarios, including automatic discounts and offer filtering based on experimental variations. The second update at 13:00:30 appears to be a minor edit, without noticeable functional changes.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` (12:51:55, 12:55:01, 12:55:07, 12:59:42): This Svelte component handles address input fields.  The code is complex and includes significant logic for handling address input, validation, and interaction with various stores (e.g., `store_selectedAddress`, `store_pincode`). There are multiple updates to this file, primarily involving refinements and conditional logic around handling additional address fields based on flags like `$store_additionalAddress` and `$store_addressSuggestionFlow`, as well as adjustments related to billing addresses and KwikPass login flows.  The repeated updates suggest iterative development and bug fixing within the address input handling.  The final update at 12:59:42  appears to be a minor edit, similar to the Discounts.service change.


The overall pattern in the changes is a focus on refining the checkout UI's functionality around address input and discount application, with multiple iterations suggesting ongoing development and testing. The numerous environment-specific URLs and token configurations indicate a need for supporting various stages of deployment (development, testing, production).

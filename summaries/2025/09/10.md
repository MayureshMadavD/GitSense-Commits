# Activity Summary for 10/09/2025

## 12:02:20
The provided log shows multiple revisions of a Svelte component (`AvailableOffers.svelte`) responsible for displaying available discounts and offers in a checkout UI.  The code heavily relies on Svelte stores (`store_offers`, `store_allAppliedDiscounts`, `store_paymentMethods`, etc.) for managing application state.

The core functionality involves fetching and displaying available coupons, categorizing them (Active Coupons, Payment Offers, Other Coupons), handling auto-applied payment offers based on payment methods (EMI, UPI, Cards, Wallet), and managing the visibility of offers based on A/B testing experiments (`store_showHidePaymentOffers`).  The component also logs events (`logEvent`) for tracking user interactions and offer views.

Significant changes seem to occur around 11:20:23, 11:22:27, 11:23:19, and 11:23:24, with minor differences between the commits in this timeframe.  The final revision at 12:02:12 appears identical to the previous commits. These changes likely involve minor bug fixes or code refinements as there are no substantial structural or functional differences.

The `reorderCoupons` function is noteworthy, as it prioritizes the display of payment offers based on the order specified in `store_paymentMethodsOrder`,  particularly for wallet payments, showing attention to detail in presentation.  The `checkShowHidePaymentOffers` function demonstrates A/B testing variations on offer visibility, allowing for different experiments in hiding cashback or BIN offers.  The component also dynamically updates its appearance based on the `store_paymentsGeneralConfig` store, selecting between different template versions (`TEMPLATE_VERSIONS`).

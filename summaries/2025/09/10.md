# Activity Summary for 10/09/2025

## 12:02:20
The provided log shows multiple revisions of a Svelte component (`AvailableOffers.svelte`) responsible for displaying available discounts and offers in a checkout UI.  The code heavily relies on Svelte stores (`store_offers`, `store_allAppliedDiscounts`, `store_paymentMethods`, etc.) for managing application state.

The core functionality involves fetching and displaying available coupons, categorizing them (Active Coupons, Payment Offers, Other Coupons), handling auto-applied payment offers based on payment methods (EMI, UPI, Cards, Wallet), and managing the visibility of offers based on A/B testing experiments (`store_showHidePaymentOffers`).  The component also logs events (`logEvent`) for tracking user interactions and offer views.

Significant changes seem to occur around 11:20:23, 11:22:27, 11:23:19, and 11:23:24, with minor differences between the commits in this timeframe.  The final revision at 12:02:12 appears identical to the previous commits. These changes likely involve minor bug fixes or code refinements as there are no substantial structural or functional differences.

The `reorderCoupons` function is noteworthy, as it prioritizes the display of payment offers based on the order specified in `store_paymentMethodsOrder`,  particularly for wallet payments, showing attention to detail in presentation.  The `checkShowHidePaymentOffers` function demonstrates A/B testing variations on offer visibility, allowing for different experiments in hiding cashback or BIN offers.  The component also dynamically updates its appearance based on the `store_paymentsGeneralConfig` store, selecting between different template versions (`TEMPLATE_VERSIONS`).


## 13:02:19
The provided log shows three entries for the same Svelte component file, `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/AvailableOffers.svelte`,  at very close timestamps (12:11:39, 12:13:35, 12:14:24 on October 9, 2025).  The code within the file remains virtually identical across all three entries. This suggests minor, undetectable changes might have occurred between commits, perhaps whitespace changes or very minor adjustments that do not alter the functionality.  The core functionality of the component remains consistent: it manages the display and application of available discounts and offers, integrating with various services and stores to fetch, filter, and present offers to the user.  Key features include:

* **Offer Filtering and Display:**  The component filters offers based on their type (active coupons, payment offers, other coupons), auto-apply status, and payment method compatibility.  It also handles the visual display based on a configurable template version (`TEMPLATE_VERSIONS`).
* **Payment Method Integration:**  It integrates with payment methods (Cards, UPI, EMI, Wallet), automatically applying applicable payment offers based on the selected methods.  The order of payment methods is also considered while showing offers.
* **Event Logging:**  The component logs events for analytics purposes (e.g., `savings_shown`, `apply_auto_offer`, `rto_ab_discount_shown`).
* **Store Interactions:** The component extensively uses Svelte stores (`store_offers`, `store_paymentMethods`, `store_allAppliedDiscounts`, etc.) for managing application state and data.
* **A/B Testing:**  The code shows evidence of A/B testing (`experimentVariants`, `store_showHidePaymentOffers`)  for showing or hiding specific types of offers.
* **Cred Offer Handling:** The component includes logic for handling and displaying offers from the 'cred' partner.  This can be conditionally shown or hidden depending on screen width.


The lack of substantial code changes across the three entries suggests either very minor edits, or possibly a problem with the logging system recording identical entries despite minor variations.  Further investigation would be needed to determine if there are any meaningful changes.


## 16:02:17
The `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` file was updated on 10/09/2025 at 15:38:08.  This React component handles editing order details.  Significant changes involve extensive updates to the UI, likely a major refactor or feature addition. The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements,  `react-redux` for state management, and custom functions for API calls and data formatting.

The code heavily uses functional components, hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useSelector`), and the `Form` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`.  It manages line items in an order, including adding, removing, and modifying quantities.  The component also includes functionality for discounts (fixed amount and percentage), managing a list of recently deleted items, and re-adding items.  Error handling and loading states are also implemented.  The component interacts with the backend via API calls (`makeAPICall`) and uses routing (`useLocation`, `useNavigate`, `navigateToUrl`).  A significant portion of the code deals with rendering a table of order line items, including dynamic rendering of columns and actions (add, remove, modify quantity).  The use of `useMemo` optimizes the performance of data processing.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx` was updated on 10/09/2025 at 16:55:24.  This React component handles editing order details.  Significant changes include the addition of extensive state management for line items, discounts (including functionality for adding, removing, and re-adding items,  applying fixed or percentage discounts), and error handling.  The component uses `gokwik-ui-kit` for UI elements, `react-redux` for state management, and custom helper functions for API calls, formatting, and navigation.  The code features a complex data structure for handling order line items, including SKU IDs, product IDs, quantities, totals, and images.  A table is rendered using the `Table` component from `gokwik-ui-kit`,  displaying line items with actions for modifying quantity and deleting items.  There's also a modal for managing recently deleted items, allowing users to re-add them.  The component includes comprehensive data manipulation and rendering logic for handling discounts and updates to line items. The use of `useMemo` optimizes recalculations of totals based on changes in line items and discounts.


## 18:02:16
The log shows two entries for `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/orders/edit-orders/index.tsx`, both at 17:05 on October 9th, 2025, differing only by 35 seconds.  The code represents a React component for editing orders.  It uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` component library and interacts with Redux for state management.  The component manages order line items, allowing users to add, remove, and modify quantities.  A notable feature is the implementation of discounts, both at the order and item level, with options for fixed amount or percentage discounts.  The code includes functionality for managing recently deleted items, allowing users to re-add them.  The two entries appear to be near-identical, suggesting either a very minor, insignificant change or a logging error where the same version of the file was logged twice in quick succession.  No substantial functional changes are apparent between the two entries.


## 21:02:17
The log shows two updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` on October 9, 2025, at 20:27:43 and 20:27:54.  Both updates contain the same functions, but there's a minor difference in the `api_url` function's logic for the 'local' environment.  In the first version,  `api_url` for 'local' defaults to `https://sandbox.gokwik.co`, while in the second version, it's changed to `https://api.gokwik.co`. This suggests a correction or refinement in the local environment's API endpoint handling.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated once at 20:27:30 on October 9, 2025. This HTML file defines a merchant page with a form to input a merchant ID, JSON data, and select an environment.  The page includes client-side JavaScript code to handle data saving (to cookies),  a `gokwikSdk` function for interacting with a GoKwik SDK (likely for checkout functionality), and various environment-specific URLs hardcoded within the `merchantInfo` object and Javascript functions.  The Javascript code uses cookies to store and retrieve data.  The HTML also contains a button to initiate the checkout process, using hardcoded API keys (which should be handled more securely).  The appearance of the merchant page is styled with inline CSS. The code also includes a commented-out analytics script and suggests potential integration with Privy (a marketing tool).  The numerous `mid` values in the javascript suggest testing across various merchant environments (dev, sandbox, qa, prod).

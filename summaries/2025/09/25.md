# Activity Summary for 25/09/2025

## 14:13:54
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/utils/imageSanitization.ts` on September 25th, 2025 at 13:13:57.  This update involves a function `cleanImageWithCanvas` which takes a File object and two callbacks (one for success, one for error). The function uses a canvas to sanitize the image, converting it to a PNG with 90% quality. Error handling is implemented for canvas support, blob creation, and image decoding failures.  The core functionality is to read the file, create an image from it, draw it onto a canvas, and then convert the canvas content back into a File object before passing it to the success callback.

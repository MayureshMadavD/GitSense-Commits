# Activity Summary for 25/09/2025

## 14:13:54
The log shows a single code update to `/Users/madav/Documents/dashboard_checkout/dashboard-ui-utilities/src/utils/imageSanitization.ts` on September 25th, 2025 at 13:13:57.  This update involves a function `cleanImageWithCanvas` which takes a File object and two callbacks (one for success, one for error). The function uses a canvas to sanitize the image, converting it to a PNG with 90% quality. Error handling is implemented for canvas support, blob creation, and image decoding failures.  The core functionality is to read the file, create an image from it, draw it onto a canvas, and then convert the canvas content back into a File object before passing it to the success callback.


## 14:13:59
The log shows several updates to three Svelte components (`MobilePhoneInput.svelte`, `Discounts.svelte`) and an HTML file (`merchant.html`) between 13:13 and 13:30 on September 25, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`: This file, updated at 13:13:57, is an HTML page containing a merchant interface.  It includes JavaScript code for interacting with a GoKwik SDK, managing merchant information, saving data to cookies (merchant ID, JSON input, selected environment), and displaying a button to initiate checkout. The JavaScript code heavily uses `postMessage` for communication with other parts of the application.  The HTML also includes styling for the form and integrates a Privy widget.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`: This Svelte component, updated twice (13:20:41 and 13:20:49), manages discounts and offers during checkout. It interacts with numerous stores (using Svelte's reactive declarations `$:`) to handle discount codes, automatic discounts, loyalty programs, gift cards, and stacked discounts. The component has extensive logic for applying and removing discounts, handling various offer types, and updating the UI based on the applied discounts.  The numerous imports suggest a complex system involving various services for discount calculations, analytics, and API calls.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/login/MobilePhoneInput.svelte`: This Svelte component was updated multiple times (13:22:53, 13:23:09, 13:23:24, 13:23:30, 13:24:48, 13:29:35, 13:30:45)  It handles mobile phone number input during login.  The code manages input validation, interacts with various stores (similar to `Discounts.svelte`), makes API calls using `submitPhoneNumber` and `updateCart`, handles various login flows (including those involving `soToken`), and manages UI updates based on API responses.  Significant changes over the multiple updates seem to be centered around refining the handling of gift card rewards (`store_giftCardRewards`) and the logic around removing credits when applicable.  The repeated updates suggest iterative debugging and refinement of the phone number submission and subsequent data handling.  A large number of stores are imported, indicating a high degree of integration with the overall application state.

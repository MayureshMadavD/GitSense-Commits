# Activity Summary for 02/04/2025

## 15:47:50
The log shows multiple revisions of `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedMethods.tsx`  between 15:36:59 and 15:47:21 on February 4, 2025.  The changes primarily involve minor adjustments to the code's formatting and structure.  There are no significant functional changes introduced across these revisions. The core component, `ShippingMethodConfig`, remains largely unchanged, continuing to handle shipping configuration data, form submission, and CSV file upload for pincode management.  The  `fields` and `additionShippingFields` arrays, defining the form inputs, remain consistent, with only whitespace differences observable between commits.  The CSV upload functionality (`Inputs`) and validation logic also stay the same.  The repetitive nature of the commits suggests minor code cleanup or formatting adjustments rather than substantial feature additions or bug fixes.

# Activity Summary for 29/04/2025

## 01:42:01
The log shows three consecutive updates to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file within a short time frame (29/04/2025, 00:47:58 to 00:50:14).  The changes appear to be minor adjustments or bug fixes rather than substantial feature additions, as the code remains largely the same across all three versions.  The code is a Svelte component dealing with discount application logic in a checkout process.  It heavily uses numerous Svelte stores from `CommonStore` and `LoginStore` to manage application state, including cart details, user information, discount codes, and payment options.  The component interacts with various services (`Discounts.service`, `EventService`, `MerchantAPI`, `WalletCredits.service`, etc.) for fetching and applying discounts, managing gift cards, handling loyalty programs, and tracking events.  The `onMount` lifecycle method subscribes to several stores to react to changes in discount-related data, triggering updates to the UI and applying or removing discounts based on conditions, including stacking logic and one-click coupon handling.  The lack of substantive code changes across the three revisions suggests iterative debugging or minor refinement rather than a major rewrite.

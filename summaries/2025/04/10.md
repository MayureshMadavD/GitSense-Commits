# Activity Summary for 10/04/2025

## 17:01:15
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` and `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` on October 4th, 2025.  The `EnvironmentService.ts` file was modified three times, with minor timestamp differences (16:15:15, 16:15:46, 16:19:27), suggesting iterative refinements.  These changes primarily involved adjustments to the `api_url` function, adding or removing commented-out URLs for various environments ('dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and various internal environments). The `setCart` function also underwent changes, updating the cart object's `token` and related details.  No substantive structural changes are evident in `EnvironmentService.ts` across these revisions.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` file was updated twice (16:29:58, 16:38:19), with a small time gap between these updates.  The second update appears to be a minor edit, possibly fixing a debugging statement (`debugger`) added in the first revision.  This component handles discount logic, interacting with numerous stores (`store_cartId`, `store_discountCode`, `store_offers`, etc.). The code is extensive, managing various types of discounts (one-click coupons, wallet credits, gift cards, partner acquisition offers), and displaying these based on environment and user-specific criteria.  A significant portion of the code deals with handling different discount stacking configurations.  The code also includes interaction with various services for applying and removing discounts and handling events, including GTM events.  The main change between these revisions is the removal of a `debugger` statement in the `store_reapplyEr` subscriber.

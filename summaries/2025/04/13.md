# Activity Summary for 13/04/2025

## 21:37:56
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/customize-ui/customize-sections/checkoutelement.tsx` was updated on 13/04/2025 at 20:37:59.  This React component, `CheckoutElements`, allows customization of checkout UI elements.  It uses `gokwik-ui-kit` components and hooks like `useMerchantConfigApi` for fetching and saving configuration.

The update involves a significant restructuring and expansion of the `fields` object, which defines configurable sections within the checkout process.  These sections include:  `oneClickCheckout`, `discountApplication`, `exitPopout`, `orderSummarySettings`, `showStaticEDD`, and `enableGST`.  Each section contains multiple configurable fields (switches, radios, inputs, selects) with associated labels, descriptions, and validation rules.  Many fields have a recommended/not recommended indicator using visual cues.  There is also logic to handle conditional rendering of fields based on other field values (e.g., showing custom EDD message input only when the custom EDD option is selected). The component manages form state using `Form.useForm` and provides functionality to save configuration changes via `handleSave` function, including client-side validation.  The initial form values are defined, including default settings for various options.  The code uses  `deepEqualAndDiff` suggesting change detection for efficient updates.  The use of `useNavigate` indicates navigation capabilities within the application.  Finally, the component uses SVG icons for visual enhancements.

# Activity Summary for 16/04/2025

## 16:07:46
The log shows code changes on April 16th, 2025,  primarily focused on the Gokwik checkout integration and environment configuration.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` (15:09:00): This file contains the merchant's HTML page, implementing the Gokwik checkout button.  The key updates involve:

*   Adding a `gokwikSdk` JavaScript function to manage checkout interactions via `window.postMessage`. This function includes methods for initialization (`init`), payment processing (`initCheckout`), event handling (`on`, `emit`), and button hiding (`hideButton`).
*   Implementing cookie management for tracking `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer`.
*   The code includes various hardcoded merchant IDs (`mid`), app IDs (`appid`), and app secrets (`appsecret`), which should ideally be managed externally for security.
*   Integration with Privy widget for marketing promotions is also present.
*   There's a significant amount of commented-out code related to loading the Gokwik script and handling different environments (qa, sandbox, production, etc.), suggesting ongoing development and testing.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` (15:09:34): This TypeScript file manages environment-specific configurations for API calls and other settings based on the `env` variable.  Key features include:

*   Functions to retrieve base URLs for various services (health, address suggestions, API, experiment, Twidpay, KP API) with logic to choose the appropriate URL based on the environment (`dev`, `qa`, `sandbox`, `production`, and several other variations).
*   Functions to obtain tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) depending on the current environment.
*   The `cdn_path` function determines the CDN path based on the environment.
*   Multiple `analytics_api` functions indicating potentially different versions for event tracking.  
*   The code shows dependency on  `store_environment`, `store_merchanturl`, `store_cashToPrepaid` and `store_cartjsObject` variables (likely coming from Redux-like stores).
*   A `setCart` function initializes a cart object with hardcoded data, indicating potential for more dynamic cart handling in the future.

The overall pattern suggests a system under active development and testing, moving across various environments. The use of many environment-specific URLs and token generation methods highlights the need for robust environment management.  The close proximity of the timestamps suggests these two files are related changes as part of a larger update.

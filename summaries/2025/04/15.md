# Activity Summary for 15/04/2025

## 11:15:51
The log shows two entries for the file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx`, both on April 14, 2025.  The first entry is at 23:46:55 and the second at 23:47:33.  The code in both entries is identical.  The file is a React component (`ShippingService`) managing shipping settings. It uses a tabbed interface (`Tabs` from `gokwik-ui-kit`) to handle 'Shipping Method', 'Weight Based Shipping', and 'Discount Based Shipping'. Each tab uses a separate component (`ShippingMethodConfig`, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, `DiscountBaseShipping`) and interacts with a `merchantConfigCall` prop to save configuration data using different `saveConfig` functions depending on the tab.  The component dynamically renders the tabs based on the presence of shipping price data (`shippingPriceObject`). If no data exists, only the 'Shipping Method' tab is shown.  The only difference between the two entries appears to be the timestamp, suggesting a possible accidental double save or a very minor, undetectable change.

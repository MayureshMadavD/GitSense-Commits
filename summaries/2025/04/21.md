# Activity Summary for 21/04/2025

## 15:00:11
The file `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/pages/settings/shipping-settings/shipping-component/shippingBasedService.tsx` was updated on 21/04/2025 at 14:00:13.  This React component, `ShippingService`, manages shipping settings.  It uses a tabbed interface (`Tabs` from `gokwik-ui-kit`) to allow configuration of different shipping methods:  "Shipping Method," "Weight Based Shipping," and "Discount Based Shipping." Each tab utilizes a separate component (`ShippingMethodConfig`, `WeightBaseShippingMethods`, `DiscountBaseShipping`).

The component maintains state for the active tab (`activeTab`) and utilizes several functions (`handleShippingSave`, `handleWeightSave`, `handleDiscountSave`) to save configuration data using a `createConfigSaver` function that determines if a patch or full update should be performed depending on the shipping method. It also uses refetch functions (`refetchShipping`, `refetchWeight`, `refetchDiscount`) tied to each save function.  The component dynamically renders tabs based on the existence of shipping price data (`shippingPriceObject`). If no shipping prices exist, only the "Shipping Method" tab is shown.  The code incorporates data fetching and error handling, and includes an `InfoComponent` with a link to relevant documentation.  The key change is the addition of a tabbed interface to manage multiple shipping methods with individual save and refetch mechanisms for each.

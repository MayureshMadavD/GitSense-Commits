# Activity Summary for 08/04/2025

## 20:36:16
The `weeklyreport.jsx` file was updated on 08/04/2025 at 17:58:21.  The update significantly revised the component's rendering logic for weekly reports, focusing on Shopify and non-Shopify merchants.  The core changes involve:

* **Data Fetching and Processing:** The component uses `useCallback` and `useEffect` hooks to efficiently fetch and process merchant data.  It uses several helper functions from `reportfunctions.js` (e.g., `filterMerchantByGolive`, `calculateWeeklyARRForWeek`) to filter and calculate key metrics.  Data is fetched for pending and live merchants, separately for Shopify and non-Shopify platforms.  Calculations include weekly ARR, merchants per week, and totals for various merchant types (SMB, Emerging, Enterprise).

* **Table Rendering:**  The component uses several `useCallback` hooks to create reusable table rendering functions (`renderTable`, `renderTableForTarget`, etc.). These functions dynamically generate tables to display pending and live merchant data, including totals and "On Track/Off Track" status based on target values.  The tables display metrics like merchant count, expected ARR, and weekly performance against targets.  Separate rendering logic exists for Shopify and non-Shopify merchants.

* **State Management:**  The component uses `useState` to manage the state of pending and live merchants, both for Shopify and non-Shopify categories, along with their respective target data.

* **Data Aggregation:** Functions like `uniqueDataHandlerArry` and `sumOfCountForParticularArrayField` are used to process and aggregate data for display in the tables.

In summary, the update introduces a robust and well-structured component for displaying weekly reports, incorporating data fetching, processing, and visualization features tailored to different merchant categories and platforms. The extensive use of `useCallback` and `useMemo` suggests an optimization effort for performance.

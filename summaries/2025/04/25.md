# Activity Summary for 25/04/2025

## 16:09:24
The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/common/BottomSheet.svelte` file underwent two revisions on April 25th, 2025.  The first revision at 15:13:52 and the second at 15:15:00.  Both revisions heavily modify a Svelte component responsible for a bottom sheet UI element. The changes primarily involve updates to text and UI elements based on payment status and current page.

The key change between the two revisions is a minor update within the  `otp_input_page` section. Specifically, the text displayed related to the address count (`addressCount`) changed from using `addressFound` constant from `common/utils/TextConstants` to `otpPageText.addressFound`. This suggests a refactoring to improve text management.  The rest of the code remains largely consistent, indicating a focused change rather than a broad restructuring. The component extensively utilizes Svelte stores (`store_bottomSheetState`, `store_cardPaymentFailed`, `store_otpLoader`, etc.) for managing application state and features extensive conditional rendering based on payment status, current page, and various flags.  The code includes  payment handling logic (UPI, CARD), error handling, and event logging using a `logEvent` function.

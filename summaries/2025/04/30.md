# Activity Summary for 30/04/2025

## 12:50:37
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` between 12:05:37 and 12:50:03 on April 30, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on refining the calculation and display of the `totalPrice` within the Order Summary component.  Specifically, the calculation of `totalPrice` was repeatedly adjusted to incorporate various discounts (coupon, prepaid, reward-based, Shopify store credit, Gyftr), COD charges (with conditional logic based on the page number and application state), GST, and shipping charges (depending on whether shipping is treated as a product).  The `loyaltyDisplayAmount` variable was also introduced and refined to calculate loyalty discounts based on `totalPrice` and shipping cost.  The code also includes numerous subscriptions to Svelte stores to track changes in cart items, discount amounts, and other relevant data, triggering recalculations and UI updates.  The updates show an iterative process of improving the accuracy and comprehensive nature of the order summary's price calculation.  A `console.log` statement repeatedly logging `totalPrice` or `loyaltyDisplayAmount` suggests debugging or monitoring of these values during development.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated once at 11:55:27 on April 30, 2025.  This update modifies the merchant's HTML page, primarily involving Javascript code to handle communication with a Gokwik SDK for checkout functionality.  It includes initialization of the SDK (`gokwikSdk.init()`), functions for payment processing, event handling, and cookie management to track landing pages and referrer information. The script contains commented-out code that suggests experimentation with different loading methods for the Gokwik JS file.  A commented-out analytics script also hints at A/B testing or feature toggling related to analytics implementation. The code sets cookies to store the `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` for tracking purposes.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated twice, at 11:55:12 and 11:56:20 on April 30, 2025.  Both updates involve setting up environment-specific base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestions, main API endpoints, analytics, etc.).  The code extensively uses conditional statements to determine the appropriate URL based on the `env` variable (which represents the current environment, e.g., 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production'). There's a large conditional block inside the `api_url` function which suggests handling of many different environments and their respective API endpoints.  The function `setCart` was modified and shows different cart objects between the two updates.

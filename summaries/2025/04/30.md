# Activity Summary for 30/04/2025

## 12:50:37
The log shows multiple updates to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/OrderSummary.svelte` between 12:05:37 and 12:50:03 on April 30, 2025.  These changes primarily focus on refining the calculation and display of the `totalPrice` within the Order Summary component.  Specifically, the calculation of `totalPrice` was repeatedly adjusted to incorporate various discounts (coupon, prepaid, reward-based, Shopify store credit, Gyftr), COD charges (with conditional logic based on the page number and application state), GST, and shipping charges (depending on whether shipping is treated as a product).  The `loyaltyDisplayAmount` variable was also introduced and refined to calculate loyalty discounts based on `totalPrice` and shipping cost.  The code also includes numerous subscriptions to Svelte stores to track changes in cart items, discount amounts, and other relevant data, triggering recalculations and UI updates.  The updates show an iterative process of improving the accuracy and comprehensive nature of the order summary's price calculation.  A `console.log` statement repeatedly logging `totalPrice` or `loyaltyDisplayAmount` suggests debugging or monitoring of these values during development.

The file `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was updated once at 11:55:27 on April 30, 2025.  This update modifies the merchant's HTML page, primarily involving Javascript code to handle communication with a Gokwik SDK for checkout functionality.  It includes initialization of the SDK (`gokwikSdk.init()`), functions for payment processing, event handling, and cookie management to track landing pages and referrer information. The script contains commented-out code that suggests experimentation with different loading methods for the Gokwik JS file.  A commented-out analytics script also hints at A/B testing or feature toggling related to analytics implementation. The code sets cookies to store the `gk_landing_page` and `gk_orig_referrer` for tracking purposes.

The `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` file was updated twice, at 11:55:12 and 11:56:20 on April 30, 2025.  Both updates involve setting up environment-specific base URLs for various APIs (health, address suggestions, main API endpoints, analytics, etc.).  The code extensively uses conditional statements to determine the appropriate URL based on the `env` variable (which represents the current environment, e.g., 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production'). There's a large conditional block inside the `api_url` function which suggests handling of many different environments and their respective API endpoints.  The function `setCart` was modified and shows different cart objects between the two updates.


## 13:50:17
The `/Users/madav/Documents/Dashboard/checkout-dashboard-ui/src/library/components/integrations/formRender.tsx` file underwent several revisions on April 30th, 2025.

The first change at 13:12:02 involved the initial creation or significant update of the `RenderForm` component. This component uses the `gokwik-ui-kit` library and `react-redux` for rendering a form. It includes various input types (switch, input, inputNumber, select), tooltips, and conditional rendering based on user configuration (`userConfig` from `react-redux`).  The code also defines alert messages (`eddAlerts`, `pincodeAlerts`, `bulkProviderAlerts`) with links to relevant settings pages.  `loyaltyInputs`, `rewardInputs`, and `creditsInputs` arrays define the structure and properties of input fields related to loyalty programs, gift cards, and store credits.


The second modification at 13:17:02 added an import for `GiftCard` from `@public/assets/giftCard.png` and introduced a new state variable `[showImage, setShowImage]` in the `RenderForm` component, although its usage isn't shown in the provided code snippet.

The final update at 13:21:15 added a `checkbox` input to the `loyaltyInputs` array, allowing for sales channel control ("Website" and "Mobile Application") for loyalty points.  A `rules` property with a `required` validation was also added to this checkbox input.  The code remains largely focused on form rendering and configuration options for loyalty points, gift cards, and store credits.  The consistent use of tooltips to provide detailed explanations for each configuration option is notable.  The overall pattern shows incremental improvements and additions to the form's functionality and user interface.


## 16:36:33
The commit on `formRender.tsx` at 30/04/2025, 15:36:32 significantly updates the component responsible for rendering a form.  The changes primarily involve adding extensive configuration options related to loyalty programs and gift cards.  These options are implemented using various form elements from `gokwik-ui-kit`, including switches, inputs, selects, and tooltips.  The code introduces several new components such as `MaxRedeemableEasyRewardsTooltip` providing detailed explanations for input fields.  Alert messages (`eddAlerts`, `pincodeAlerts`, `bulkProviderAlerts`) are incorporated to guide users based on their configuration and onboarding status. The `RenderForm` component now accepts a `resetFields` prop for improved form management.  There's extensive use of nested arrays for naming conventions in form fields (`['custom_config', 'enable_cod_with_loyalty']`), suggesting a hierarchical structure for configuration data.  The code also uses React's `useSelector` hook to access user configuration data from Redux store and includes several conditional rendering blocks based on user configuration (`userConfig`).  The addition of input validation rules using `validator` functions adds robustness to the form handling.  The styling appears to use a CSS-in-JS approach with classes such as `flex`, `flex-col`, and `text-sm`. Finally, conditional rendering based on the `userConfig` object is used to dynamically adjust links and components depending on user settings (e.g., DIY enabled status).

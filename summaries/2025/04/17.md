# Activity Summary for 17/04/2025

## 12:00:57
The log shows code changes across two files within the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp` directory.  The changes span a period from 11:51:37 to 12:00:03 on April 17, 2025.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html`: This file, updated at 11:51:37, is an HTML file containing the frontend code for a merchant page.  It includes a button that triggers a `goKwikCheckout` function, which uses `window.postMessage` to send merchant information to another context (likely an iframe or parent window). The merchant information includes data like `mid`, `appid`, `appsecret`, and other parameters specific to the merchant and the GoKwik SDK.  The HTML also incorporates a GoKwik SDK via a script tag (with a fallback to a local development server), sets some cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), and includes a snippet for analytics tracking.  The code suggests an integration with a payment gateway or checkout service.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts`: This TypeScript file, updated twice (11:52:08 and 11:52:21), manages environment-specific configurations. It defines functions to fetch base URLs for different services (health check, address suggestion, API calls, analytics etc.) based on the current environment (`env`), which can be 'local', 'dev', 'qa', 'sandbox', 'production', and several other internal environments.  The code heavily uses conditional logic to switch between different API endpoints depending on the environment.  A notable change between the two updates is in the `api_url` function, where the default URL for 'local' environment is changed from commented-out options to `'https://sandbox.gokwik.co'`. The file also includes functions for generating tokens (`XGokwikToken`, `XKWIKPASSToken`) that also depend on the environment variable.  The `setCart` function suggests that this file handles some aspects of cart management for local environments, initialized from data included in the update.



`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte`: This Svelte component, updated twice (11:56:03 and 12:00:03), appears to manage discount logic in the checkout process. It interacts with numerous stores, suggesting a reactive UI pattern using Svelte's reactivity. The component handles various discount types (coupons, store credits, gift cards, partner offers), integrating with different services (`Discounts.service`, `MerchantAPI`, etc.). There's significant logic for applying and removing discounts, handling edge cases, and showing UI elements accordingly.  The code makes extensive use of async/await for asynchronous operations and incorporates error handling and retry mechanisms. No significant changes are observable between the two updates to this file.  The component also includes extensive logic related to one-click coupon application, discount stacking, and managing different types of offers.

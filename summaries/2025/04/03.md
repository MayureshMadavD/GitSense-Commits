# Activity Summary for 03/04/2025

## 14:38:18
The log shows two nearly identical commits to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` within one minute of each other (14:16:39 and 14:17:40).  The commits involve a Svelte component managing address input fields.  The code heavily utilizes Svelte stores (`store_...`) for state management, importing various helper functions and services related to address validation, analytics tracking (GTM, GA4), and API interactions (`addAddress`, `editAddress`).

The component dynamically adapts its input fields based on several store values, including `store_newAddressLayout`, `store_additionalAddress`, and `store_addressSuggestionFlow`, offering different layouts for new addresses, additional addresses, and address suggestions.  Conditional rendering based on `$store_enableRecipientPhone` and `addressMMIFlow` adds or removes "Recipient Phone Number" and "Apartment, Suite, etc." fields respectively.

A key functionality is the handling of KwikPass login (`isKwikPassLogin`), which affects email field read-only status. The code includes extensive input validation and error handling using `ErrorMessageInterface`.  The `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` lifecycle methods are used for dynamic field updates based on the store values.  The component also dispatches events using `createEventDispatcher`.  There are no substantive differences between the two commits in the provided snippets.


## 15:38:26
The log shows multiple revisions to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/`  project files between 14:46 and 15:32 on March 4, 2025.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/public/merchant.html` was modified twice.  The initial change (14:46:33) involved adding JavaScript code to manage a `gokwikSdk` object, handling payment processing via `window.postMessage`, initializing the GoKwik SDK, setting cookies (`gk_landing_page`, `gk_orig_referrer`), and including a GoKwik checkout button with hardcoded `data-mid`, `data-appid`, and `data-appsecret` attributes.  A second update (15:31:52) modified the `merchantInfo` object, specifically changing the `mid` value to `'eey3k3mkrg55tcs'`.  The commented-out analytics script suggests an A/B testing setup.

`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/common/services/EnvironmentService.ts` underwent several revisions (14:46:58, 14:47:09, 14:47:27, 15:32:21, 15:32:41).  This file contains functions to determine base URLs for various services (health, address suggestion, API, Cred, experiment, Twidpay, KP API, CDN) based on the environment (`env`).  The `api_url` function handles a large number of environment configurations.  The `setCart` function, called when the environment is 'local',  sets the  `store_cartjsObject` with a detailed cart structure including product information. The repeated updates to this file primarily involve minor adjustments to the `api_url` function's logic and, in one instance (15:32:21 and 15:32:41), changing the default URL for the 'local' environment.  The cart token value changed significantly between 14:47 and 15:32.


`/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/place-order/Discounts/Discounts.svelte` was updated multiple times (14:52:35, 14:53:58, 14:59:49, 15:00:06, 15:00:58). This Svelte component manages discount application, including various discount types (store credit, gift cards, partner offers, one-click coupons), and handles discount stacking logic. The component interacts with multiple stores and services to fetch and apply discounts. The significant amount of changes across these commits suggests iterative development and bug fixing related to discount logic and handling multiple offer types and edge cases.  The code shows robust error handling and logging, incorporating GTM events.

The overall pattern suggests active development of a checkout UI, particularly focusing on refining the discount application and API endpoint management based on environment variables.  The frequent changes to `EnvironmentService.ts` and `Discounts.svelte` imply an iterative process of testing and implementing various discount strategies and API configurations across different environments.

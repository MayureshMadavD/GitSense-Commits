The log shows two nearly identical commits to `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/src/Components/address/AddressInputs.svelte` within one minute of each other (14:16:39 and 14:17:40).  The commits involve a Svelte component managing address input fields.  The code heavily utilizes Svelte stores (`store_...`) for state management, importing various helper functions and services related to address validation, analytics tracking (GTM, GA4), and API interactions (`addAddress`, `editAddress`).

The component dynamically adapts its input fields based on several store values, including `store_newAddressLayout`, `store_additionalAddress`, and `store_addressSuggestionFlow`, offering different layouts for new addresses, additional addresses, and address suggestions.  Conditional rendering based on `$store_enableRecipientPhone` and `addressMMIFlow` adds or removes "Recipient Phone Number" and "Apartment, Suite, etc." fields respectively.

A key functionality is the handling of KwikPass login (`isKwikPassLogin`), which affects email field read-only status. The code includes extensive input validation and error handling using `ErrorMessageInterface`.  The `beforeUpdate` and `afterUpdate` lifecycle methods are used for dynamic field updates based on the store values.  The component also dispatches events using `createEventDispatcher`.  There are no substantive differences between the two commits in the provided snippets.

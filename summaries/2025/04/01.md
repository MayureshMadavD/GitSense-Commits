# Activity Summary for 01/04/2025

## 13:58:15
The log shows two modifications to the `/Users/madav/Documents/checkout UI/gokwik.pdp/.vscode/launch.json` file.  Both entries configure a Chrome launch configuration within VS Code. The key difference between the two revisions (occurring within a minute of each other, at 12:59:31 and 12:59:41 on January 4th, 2025) is the `url` property within the configuration.  The first revision targets `http://localhost:9000`, while the second revision changes this to `http://localhost:1010`, suggesting a port change for the development server.  The rest of the launch configuration remains identical.
